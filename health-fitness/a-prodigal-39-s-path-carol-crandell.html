  <title>A Prodigal&#39;s Path - Carol Crandell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Judge Sarah remands Danny Jenkins and Sam Andrew into the custody of Mort and Mary Bishop, Danny struggles to accept that if he blows his chance with Mort, he takes Sam down with him. As Sam succumbs to Mary&amp;rsquo;s mothering, Danny nurses his anger and resists Mort&amp;rsquo;s guidance. At school, Danny finds that his running ability threatens Michael Tracy, the senior track star, and Sam encounters harassment and bullying from Zeke Benton and his sidekicks. Brady Lewis, another newcomer, befriends Danny, and when Danny later suspects Brady of rustling calves, he finds himself torn between ratting on a friend and Mort&amp;rsquo;s sense of what is right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the weeks pass, between school, mules, working to restore an old Chevy pickup, and packing salt to cattle on the range, the boys build self-confidence. Sam defeats Zeke in the boxing ring, but Danny&amp;rsquo;s weekly track challenge to Michael escalates until during a locker check the principal finds marijuana in Danny&amp;rsquo;s locker. Danny assumes that he has blown his chance with Mort, and when the opportunity arises, he takes the Chevy and runs only to stall deep in the marsh. Though he acknowledges his error and knows that he jeopardizes Sam&amp;rsquo;s future, he sees no way out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
