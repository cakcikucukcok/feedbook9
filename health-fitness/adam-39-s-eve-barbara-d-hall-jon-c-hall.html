    	<p>During the past thirty years, we have experienced what is probably the most significant social revolution ever in the history of mankind. The effects have had long reaching impact on our personal relationships, financial affairs, families, friends and work environments. Beginning with the womens movement in the late 60s and early 70s, this social revolution was supported and propelled by federal legislation as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As a result, men and women in America and around the world have found themselves in a new culture where women have established careers and personal status beyond the home and family life. In addition, our culture has found itself in the middle of a transition, including the great divide fueling the war or battle of the sexes. Relationships between the sexes have been polarized with women coming into their own as individuals expanding beyond the traditional roles of their mothers. This handbook provides the insight for examining the underlying cultural biases that cause the individual to make important personal decisions automatically, without thinking, and providing knowledge for the individual to use for personal benefit in making important decisions. The historical, legal and personal aspects of this handbook can provide valuable insight for both men and women in handling important issues in their lives today. </p>
