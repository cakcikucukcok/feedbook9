  <title>A Pound of Prevention: Eight Secrets of Healthy Living - Dr. Alfred Nkut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Health promotion still remains the best option to foster good health, especially given the fact that so many health problems can lead to permanent damage. There has to be a balance between our mind, body and soul. For optimum health, those three parts must be in harmony. The essence of this book is to show you how to become an instrument of positive influence for living a happier, healthier life.
Most of what is involved in staying healthy is doing the basic things that are common knowledge to most people. But like all else, you make the difference by not only knowing what to do, but putting into practice. Our happiness is determined by the quality of our thoughts, learning how to arrange our mind and detoxify it from toxic or negative emotions.
Follow Lucky Harry&#39;s story and how he learned to apply the secrets to healthy living. Lucky Harry&#39;s success came because he became imaginative, and made the move to choose good habits that will help him achieve healthy living. His cooperation was necessary. He turned the corner, and achieved excellent health. Something he always thought of as just a dream." />
