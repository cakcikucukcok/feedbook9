  <title>I Believe to My Soul - Dr. Jabali Zuberi Limbani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Believe to My Soul: Trials and Triumphs of an African American Male Growing Up in America details chronological events about a young mans journey through adolescence and young adulthood and the daily struggles he encountered in his quest to become a man. Barely escaping death through drug addiction, shoot outs and going in and out of jail like they were mini vacations, Jabalis self esteem hit rock bottom when he came to realize in prison that his best friend was a rat!
Having endured a poverty stricken, plantation life in early childhood, a troubled urban ghetto life during adolescence, and a drug addicted, criminal lifestyle in his young adulthood, the author gives candid accounts of his experiences regarding the dramatic changes he has undergone in transitioning from a plantation to penitentiary to acquiring a Ph.D.
This book delivers a story about failure and success that is inspirational, motivational, confrontational, humorous and thought provoking. It is a story that has never been told  a must read novel.
Jabali Zuberi Limbani holds an Associates degree in Business Administration, a Bachelors degree in Human Resources Development, a Masters degree in Social Work, a Specialists degree in Humanistic Psychology, and a Doctorates degree in Clinical Psychology. He maintains a clinical practice in Bloomfield Hills and a licensed residential treatment home for neglect, abused and adjudicated youth in Pontiac, Michigan. Founder of CALLING ALL BROTHERS, mentor program, the only non funded program working with troubled youth, Jabali has made a life long commitment to helping boys become responsible men and has conducted rites of passage programs and activities for the past 25 years." />
