Praise for the GuideBook:
Let&#39;s face itself-reflection and putting words on paper can be daunting. Shoshana Kobrin&#39;s GuideBook provides an approachable, easy-to-use format for giving yourself permission to reflect on those aspects you&#39;d like to enhance . . . . or change. As you write down your reflections, you&#39;ll  gain a new appreciation of yourself, your world, and the people in it. And you&#39;ll move from self-rejection to self-acceptance.
 ELAYNE SAVAGE, PhD, author of Don&#39;t Take It Personally! The Art of Dealing with Rejection, and Breathing Room - Creating Space to Be a Couple.
When I finished the GuideBook, I wanted to share it with everyone dear to me. It&#39;s a great read with wise and practical strategies on achieving happy, fulfilling relationships and life goals. By applying the strategies, your thought process changes, leading to a more positive outlook on life.
