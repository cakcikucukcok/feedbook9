  <title>TIME: A Traveler’s Companion - Oliver Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This seminal narrative on time is a commentary on strategic ways we all can live meaningful lives. As we all journey as travelers through life, time like a shadow, is our constant companion. It lives in us, as we live in time. It is our most precious unreplenishable commodity that begins its first tick at conception with a terrestrially undetermined expiration date.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How we orchestrate the journey from the cradle to the grave typifies our lifestyle, which reflects and identifies whether meaning and purpose were discovered. When meaning and purpose are discovered, time is prioritized each day and lived with meaningful specificity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This book is an inspirational and motivational appeal. It depicts how the gift of life intersects poignantly with the gift of time in a purposeful way within each individual. It provides existential strategies on how to live life abundantly between the parameters of our birth and the certainty of our demise.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Each chapter provides pertinent anecdotal descriptives that will captivate your attention and encourage you so that you are equipped with the relevant prescriptions to pull the trigger in the direction of your destiny. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We all have the capacity to live meaningful lives by cultivating a Samaritan spirit because what we do for others and community leaves a legacy and what is done for self you take with you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A great literary scholar once said that “there are two important days in the life of each individual… the day you were born and the day you figured out why”. This book is a step in that direction.&lt;br&gt;" />
