&lt;p&gt;Is There a New and Better Way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer tries to show how we can find and build a good relationship with a marriage partner. He deals with important cultural and societal issues that might lead to our not getting married and problems that can lead to divorce or worse after marriage. The author also discusses practical solutions and ideas for how we can address and resolve the problems that do often appear in all relationships and marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is most interesting that at the end the author strongly suggests that most good marriages do come full circle and both partners do accept that what they have is positive and spiritual and worth keeping. Th at is the valuable journey this writer takes us all on in this book and the lesson he hopes this book gives to his readers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society always evolves, and it is always good to take what worked well in the past with you to create a better future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
