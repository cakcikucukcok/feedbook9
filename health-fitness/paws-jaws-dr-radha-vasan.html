  <title>Paws &amp; Jaws - Dr. Radha Vasan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true love story between my dog, a boxer, a total minx, and our family! I have followed her life through the vigor and zest with which she lives her life, and the richer our life has become because of that. She is very loved and cared for, but its nothing compared to the extraordinary love and affection she has for her humans.
Lizzy is my symbol of optimism, hope, and faith in life when there is not much of this left in humanity. Seeing her lovely face each day brings a smile to my face and immense glee in my heart. I want nothing more to do in my life than to just hold her in my arms and keep kissing her! She is that lovable! She has the most adorable face in the whole wide world, which she uses to her maximum advantage! Her expressions are so vivid and so many that its like she speaks out and voices her feelings. I have brought out her innate sweetness and simplicity. Her friskiness and mischievous antics endear her to all.
Every nuance in her life is meaningful, and she rejoices in it and makes us all a part of it. Life is never dull around her. She puts life into the most mundane tasks." />
