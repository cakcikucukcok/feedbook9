  <title>Nothing Lasts Forever - Dr Anniekie Ravhudzulo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 1em; text-indent: 0pt;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When night comes, look at the sky. If you see a falling star, dont wonder why, just make a wish. Trust me, it will come true, because I did and found Jesus Christ. Sometimes we think that things will never change in life. I dont know anyone who has not yet experienced pressure of one kind or another in life. It may raise its head swiftly and unexpectedly. Or we may see and feel it coming slowly but surely, like a slight crack in the wall of a building going up or down. You might arrive late for some event and miss something special. This is a minor pressure, and it usually does not last long; its an everyday occurrence that does not really matter very much. There are many such pressures. On the other hand, the pressure of realising that the dream you had has failed to come true may overcome you. You may feel depressed because of the loss of your spouse, the chaos in the workplace, the loss of friends, or the insincerity of those you considered friends, a lack of understanding on the part of your family, heartache that never seems to end, or feeling that God does not hear your prayer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are more types of pressure than there is grass growing on the plains of the Highveld. Do not give up when you still have something to give. I know that through Christ I am strong enough to make all my dreams come true. I know love, therefore I give love. I recognise that my love has great value and must be reciprocated. If my unconditional love is taken for granted, it doesnt disappear. I am quite capable of articulating my needs. I know that with God the world is my playground, but without God I will just be played with. I understand that my life experiences are merely lessons meant to bring me closer to self-knowledge and unconditional self-love. I know that I will at times have to inspire others to reach the potential God gave them. I know my past, understand my present and face my future. I am not afraid of tomorrow for I have seen yesterday and I love today. Jim Rohn says that happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
