  <title>Heels of Steel: Surviving &amp; Thriving in the Corporate World - Vanessa Vallely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Heels of Steel tracks the trials and tribulations of &quot;the most networked woman in the City&quot; (Evening Standard); a woman who started in the City at just 15 and worked her way up to C-suite. Having achieved everything she thought she&#39;d ever wanted, Vanessa quickly learnt that success often comes at a great deal of personal cost and compromise. The constant battling and accomplishment of the ultimate grand prize eventually took its toll and drastically altered her definition of &#39;success&#39;, encouraging a life-changing move in a new direction. From periods of glittering success to near total derailment, Heels of Steel unveils the truth behind a woman&#39;s climb to success in the male dominated City world. You are invited to follow her journey as she scales (and slips up and down) the corporate ladder, digging her heels in to avoid being absorbed by the politics and alpha male behaviour still prevalent in so many corporate environments. A mid-career realisation about her deep-rooted need to rediscover and be proud of her femininity helped Vanessa to discover things she never knew about herself, and introduced much-needed support from other women, which had been absent throughout her career. The book provides transparent insight into the world of corporate women, addresses the challenges facing every ambitious person throughout their career journey and tackles our never-ending search for balance. Packed with tips, advice and practical steps based on real life experiences, this autobiographical story is also a practical guide that will fast become a must-read for anyone seeking to not only survive the corporate jungle, but stand some chance of thriving in it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
