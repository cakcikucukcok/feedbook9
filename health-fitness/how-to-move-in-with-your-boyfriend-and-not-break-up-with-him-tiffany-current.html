  <title>How to Move in with Your Boyfriend (and Not Break up with Him) - Tiffany Current</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Living in sin isn&#39;t what it used to be. Nowadays, shacking up is almost a rite of passage;couples are living together now more than ever. The question is, are they any good at it? Or will you be any good at it? Whether you&#39;re in a live-in relationship or about to be in one, Tiffany Current&#39;s &lt;I&gt;How to Move In with Your Boyfriend (and Not Break Up with Him)&lt;/I&gt; aims to help you stay smart and happy along the road to live-in bliss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Current successfully navigated the perils of her live-in relationship only to marry the man who provided fodder for her &quot;how to&quot; guidebook. But it wasn&#39;t &quot;all that&quot; from the start. Within weeks of moving in with him, she was ready to chuck his PlayStation out the window and hand his cat off to a stranger. After only a few short months, she was ready to end her relationship since they couldn&#39;t agree on anything. Whether discussing cleaning habits, house rules, or decorating tastes, everything turned into an argument. As a result, she realized three important success laws:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. Communication. Communication is important in any live-in relationship. You need to constantly let each other know what is and isn&#39;t working in order for your live-in relationship to be a success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Teamwork. In any live-in relationship, you need to be willing to work together and share in the responsibilities (in setting ground rules, handling chores, making decisions, dealing with relationship hardships, etc.). If you aren&#39;t making your relationship an equal partnership (or being a team player), then one person will always feel like they&#39;re getting the shorter end of the stick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. Compromise. If you want your live-in relationship to last, then you need to be able to compromise. Since this is a partnership, that means you can&#39;t always have things your way. You need to be willing to hear other options and come up with solutions that you both can agree on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;How to Move In with Your Boyfriend (and Not Break Up with Him)&lt;/I&gt; is packed with witty communication tips, quizzes, hilarious mock conversations and more, all designed to help you in your decision to shack up or make the most of the situation you&#39;re already in. Own up to your bad habits and know your deal breakers! Are there things you shouldn&#39;t share? What should you do about his ratty La-Z-Boy. What about chores, money, pets, and friends? And what about your SEX life - will it change?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Men and women cohabitating is on the rise. Statistics show that nearly half of every woman you know will cohabitate at some point. And with today&#39;s economy, cohabitating makes sense. But be smart about it. &lt;I&gt;How to Move In with Your Boyfriend (and Not Break Up with Him)&lt;/I&gt; will help you, your girlfriends - even your own mother - identify and make the best of decisions when it comes live-in bliss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Added Value: &lt;I&gt;How to Move In with Your Boyfriend (and Not Break Up with Him)&lt;/I&gt; may even help lead you down the aisle like it did the author. &lt;/div&gt;" />
