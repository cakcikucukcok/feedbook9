  <title>Mystical Mentor - Dick Warn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written in the style of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot;-Mystical Mentor, based on a true story, is a powerful pathway filled with simple exercises anyone can use to break through barriers. If it feels like something is missing and you have yet to find your rightful place, this book may have been written for you.   
Richard was well-dressed and attempting to impress others when he met Russell Swank, a humble self-made multi-millionaire. The real Richard, the man behind his mask, had trouble making ends meet but instantly felt Russell had the answers. Through a series of weekly meetings and eye-opening assignments, Richard was inspired to transform his life from just over broke to a grand adventure. 
This journey that Richard took did not reveal new truths-there aren&#39;t any. Russell helped Richard see life&#39;s most powerful truths in new light. If you are willing to dive in and apply some of the concepts, doors will open and rewarding changes will occur. 
Mystical Mentor is not a religious book-it is a spiritual book.
When Richard (Dick Warn) told Russell that he would be writing this book, Russell made Dick promise to not share any concept that he had not proven. The proving took 20 years. The actual writing - first draft to final - demanded 10 more." />
