  <title>Curiosity Killed the Craving - Raj Fernandes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Quitting smoking doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having smoked for over 40 years, I had tried all sorts of methods of quitting. But no matter what I tried, the cravings would always return to haunt me. All attempts to overcome cravings failed until I discovered a simple technique that helped me get the better of them. The secret turned out to be my own mind. So I practiced observing the onset of cravings in a curious, mindful way. This helped me acknowledge the presence of cravings rather than struggle with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this no-nonsense book, I share what has worked for me and guide you through the process from preparing to quit, to the realities of the first few days without nicotine, to making positive lifestyle changes going forward. It is full of practical tips and personal experiences. Quitting is never easy, but trust me, if I can do it anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a way to &amp;nbsp;say goodbye to Mr. Nicotine for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
