  <title>Radical Recovery - Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In reading this book, you will discover that you are much more powerful than your addiction, much more powerful than the obsessive thoughts, compulsive feelings, and physical cravings that create so much pain and suffering in your life and the lives of those you love. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will learn that there is no future in addiction, just a regrettable past that keeps repeating itself over and over again. You will cut through the recovery myths that result in an endless cycle of relapses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can inspire and motivate you to reach deep inside yourself and awaken the extraordinary powers that nature has bestowed on you as it guides you through a process that transforms cravings for alcohol or drugs into cravings for courage, freedom, honesty, integrity, humility, and peace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to HBO&#39;s documentary, Rehab, of the 2 million people who seek treatment each year in the United States, 1,840,000 will relapse within twelve months; some the first day. That&#39;s a 92 percent failure rate. This is a national disgrace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE ANTIDOTE FOR ADDICTION &lt;br /&gt;
With more than thirty-five years of continuous sobriety, Kelly presents not a cure but a powerful antidote for addiction, something that counteracts or relieves a harmful or unwanted condition." />
