  <title>The Conscious Relationship of I and Myself - Gyan.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Conscious Relationship Of I And Myself&lt;/i&gt; represents the understandings I have come to through my own personal path of self discovery, it is a way to see the connection of all things as a complete whole without exception and how putting this knowledge into practice can and will end all the conflict in not only my life but also in anybody elses that is willing to take up the challenge, allowing humanity once again return to heaven on earth .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of my life I had felt like there was a part of me that was missing, the feeling that I didnt belong here and even that idea that I was born in the wrong time period often crossed my mind. This lead me to the path of self-discovery , a path that would take me half way around the world seeking the answers to the questions that raged around in my head of who, what and why I was here . At the age of 38 while living in India I finally received the answers I had been seeking .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a light at the end of the tunnel experience after contracting an illness and refusing treatment while trying to starve my body to death. I finally understood the relationship between the physical and non-physical and where the idea of separation came from and how &lt;i&gt;The Conscious Relationship Of I And Myself, &lt;/i&gt;expressed as The Game Of Life, is the reason we are all here. It was never my intention writing this story to change your life, thats your job, all that I will say is that if you put into practice what is being implied in &lt;i&gt;The Conscious Relationship Of I And Myself &lt;/i&gt;you will come to an understanding of just how powerful you are, as a unique individual being, to literally change the world you inhabit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything in the universe truly is interconnected and interactive as modern science has suggested then what you do affects the whole. What if your energy is all that is needed to tip the scale towards unity, dont you owe it to yourself and the rest of humanity to at least try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me in the silent revolution, stop talking and start acting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
