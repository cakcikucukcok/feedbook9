  <title>The Zouddha Manuscripts - Nirmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Journey into the amazing world of Zouddha, an ancient philosophy for self-realization that defined a unique way of life  a life abundant both materially &amp; spiritually and focused on complete inner &amp; outer freedom as an individual. The manuscripts that detailed all the secrets for successfully achieving this way of life were lost to the world when they mysteriously disappeared more than seven hundred years ago. Nirmann takes you on a scintillating tour through the mysteries of a long lost world of symbols, an age old secret practice of meditation and mystical secrets for inner alchemy from an ancient civilization that existed thousands of years ago in the snow clad Himalayan region of India. Prepare to be surprised and thrilled as Nirmann narrates a magical tale that eventually divulges the secrets and mystical framework of the Zouddha lifestyle for leading a life of freedom, of living both - a materially abundant  &amp; deeply fulfilling spiritual life while living within the mainstream world. Learn about the intricacies that teach living a life of mastery as opposed to slavery. The ancient Zouddha Manuscripts explain the origin and meaning of different types of invisible chains that we are unknowingly held captives of and continue to lead a slaves life in the major areas of life such as money, body, senses, emotions, values, beliefs, religion and spirituality. 
In the quest for discovering the ancient Zouddha Manuscripts, the book takes the readers through an adventurous journey from Delhi, to Boston, to Amsterdam, to a mysterious island in the modern day Persia, and following clues from Israel to Zurich. The book goes further to reveal the seven realms of life that hold the secret teachings of Zouddha promising the stopping of abuse &amp; exploitation that we face from others &amp; from ourselves, to discovering our true original inner self, to giving ourselves a new birth and discovering the answer to the quintessential question  who am I." />
