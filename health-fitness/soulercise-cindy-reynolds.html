  <title>Soulercise - Cindy Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do you do when life delivers devastating blows? How do you cope? Have you ever experienced the death or loss of a loved one; had a serious accident or illness; been deeply hurt or betrayed? Have you ever invested years of your life in a job, only to be suddenly laid off? &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Each day you are confronted with a variety of tests and trials, whether physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. Will the difficulties in your journey through life crush and defeat you? Or will they become challenges that stretch you, soul food that nourishes your growth?&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Today, Cindy Reynolds is happy, strong, and compassionate. But it wasnt always this way. Beginning at the age of twelve, people that she adored died. She suffered through the life threatening illnesses of her family, and experienced lay offs and career crisis. She was alone and full of fear and self-doubt. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; These tragedies and a personal encounter with angels, inspired Cindy to turn within on a journey that led to the discovery of her own soul. There she found the insights, answers, and spiritual tools to transform fear, anger, insecurity, and depression into strength, patience, confidence, and greater wisdom to walk her path through daily life. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; And now she shares these remarkable tools with you!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
