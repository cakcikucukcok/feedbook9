  <title>Lovespeaks - Marvette Camille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Loves voice comes through very eloquently via well-written pieces that speak to the deepest part of youthe heart of youthat is unable to do anything but listen. Loves voice will sometimes whisper and will sometimes scream, but at all times, it will be recognizable, because love does have its own distinct, unmistakable languagea language that captivates and keeps us transfixed. As mere mortals, no matter how hard we try, we can never, ever be happy without love in our lives. This book will speak to all that loves encompasses, leaving the reader happy to be in love if they are in a relationship and wanting to be in one if they are not. LoveSpeaks will make the in-love reader even more in love with love, and make those who are a little mad at love remember that love is pure and therefore incapable of causing hurt, and that, in truth, love never hurts anyone; people do." />
