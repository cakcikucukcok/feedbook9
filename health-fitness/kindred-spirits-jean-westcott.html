  <title>Kindred Spirits - Jean Westcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;A few days before Thanksgiving, eleven-year old Rad Sergeant found Lance Corby, a boy about his own age, living in the Peak Mountains behind his ranch.  The boys connected immediately, talking for hours, revealing their most private thoughts.  Lance boasted about huffing and breathing inhalants; although Rad loathed Lances dreadful habit and told him so, he felt pity for a kid living alone in the mountains.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Then one day while checking on Lance, Rad found him passed out and immediately called his Dad for help. The doctor said Lance had pneumonia without much hope of pulling through since he had inhaled chemicals for years.  Five days later and very much to the doctors surprise, Lance woke up and was able to speak, but slipped away from the hospital without anyone knowing and headed back to the mountains.  Even though the weather was dreadfully cold, Rad set out to find and bring Lance home with him.  Then again, two very angry, hungry wolves had other ideas and the boys found themselves fighting for their lives.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/I&gt; is a colorful, spirit filled addition to the Rad Sergeant western adventure series for the young reader.&lt;/P&gt;" />
