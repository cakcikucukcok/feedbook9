One fine day I thought lets just make this thing big, make it worth more remarks, I thought why not a collectible of little doodles. I did not want them to be stuck in my journal or on the penultimate page of my notebook. These little doodles that earned me love and connection with my readers, also made me valiant enough to step up and convert my blog (after which the book is named) into a book. My debut in the literary world- this book is a metaphor for me in many ways. 
Its a result of endless thinking, uncountable backspaces, innumerable real and virtual drafts, honest experiences, even more honest feelings and of course, indomitable faith in my words.
So, heres me in black and white, unadulterated right in these pages waiting for you to read me, speculate about me but, more importantly to feel me!" />
