  <title>The Grown-Up&#39;s Guide to Teenage Humans - Josh Shipp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nautilus Gold Award Winner: Parenting &amp;#38; Family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical guide to understanding teens from bestselling author and global youth advocate Josh Shipp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Harvard researchers found that every child who does well in the face of adversity has had at least one stable and committed relationship with a supportive adult. But Josh Shipp didn&amp;#8217;t need Harvard to know that. Once an at-risk foster kid, he was headed straight for trouble until he met the man who changed his life: Rodney, the foster parent who refused to quit on Shipp and got him to believe in himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Grown-Up&amp;#8217;s Guide to Teenage Humans&lt;/em&gt;, Shipp shows all of us how to be that caring adult in a teenager&amp;#8217;s life. Stressing the need for compassion, trust, and encouragement, he breaks down the phases of a teenage human from sixth to twelfth grade, examining the changes, goals, and mentality of teenagers at each stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipp offers revelatory stories that take us inside the teen brain, and shares wisdom from top professionals and the most expert grown-ups. He also includes practice scripts that address tough issues, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FORGIVENESS: What do I do when a teen has been really hurt by someone and it&amp;#8217;s not their fault?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COMMUNICATION: How do I get a teen to talk to me? They just grunt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TRUST: My teen blew it. My trust is gone. Where do we go from here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BULLYING: Help! A teen (or their friend) is being harassed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DIFFICULT AND AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS: Drugs. Death. Sex. Oh my.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in Shipp&amp;#8217;s playfully authoritative, no-nonsense voice, &lt;em&gt;The Grown-Up&amp;#8217;s Guide to Teenage Humans&lt;/em&gt; tells his story and unpacks practical strategies that can make a difference. Ultimately, it&#39;s not about shortcuts or magic words&amp;#8212;as Shipp reminds us, it&amp;#8217;s about investing in kids and giving them the love, time, and support they need to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that means every kid is one caring adult away from being a success story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
