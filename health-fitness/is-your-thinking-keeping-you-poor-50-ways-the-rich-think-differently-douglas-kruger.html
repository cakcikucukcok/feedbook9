  <title>Is Your Thinking Keeping You Poor?: 50 Ways the Rich Think Differently - Douglas Kruger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Thinking like a poor person will keep you poor. Thinking like a wealthy person will make you wealthy. I would like to show you exactly what the differences between the two ways of thinking are and how you can use them in your favour.&#39; - Douglas Kruger - Douglas Kruger  Being rich is not normal: most people never achieve wealth in their lifetime. The very word &#39;rich&#39; describes a state beyond the median, and therein lies an important lesson. To become rich, you will have to think radically differently from the way most people around you think. Do you know what those specific differences may be?  Business and wealth guru Douglas Kruger strips away the feel-good hype and gets right down to the practical principles. He leads you through the types of thinking that hold individuals, families and businesses in generational cycles of poverty. He explores the dramatically different approaches of the self-made rich and super-rich, showing you which behaviours to begin practising and which behaviours are traitorous to your wealth potential. Escape poverty. Raise your value. Change the trajectory of your story. It all begins with the way you think." />
