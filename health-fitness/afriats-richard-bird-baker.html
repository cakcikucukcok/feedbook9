  <title>Afriats - Richard Bird Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This may be one of the most important books you will ever read. It identifies, defines, describes, 
analyzes, and suggests actions to take toward a highly pervasive social phenomenon that social 
scientists should have recognized at least a century ago. Somehow the social scientific community has 
always overlooked this phenomenon, even though it affects, if not envelops, a large majority of people 
in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is likely one of the leading causes of frustration, stress, fatigue, 
disappointment, disillusionment, depression, unhappiness, anger, quarrels, road rage, violence, 
substance abuse, domestic abuse, neurosis, and perhaps even suicides in modern civilization. This is 
the phenomenon of &quot;afriations&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t try to look that term up in any source other than this text. It&#39;s a term the author had to 
coin for this concept which has yet to be academically identified. Yet afriats are probably the most 
complained about topic of conversation, and for tens of millions of Americans, they cause some of our 
most dreaded problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simple understanding of afriations, and a basic knowledge of how to interact with afriats, 
we can avoid much of the stress and grief caused by afriations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
