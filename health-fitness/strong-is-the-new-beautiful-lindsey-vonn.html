  <title>Strong Is the New Beautiful - Lindsey Vonn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lessons in strength, fitness, food, and attitude from the popular world champion skier and beauty icon&amp;#8212;Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympic Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn wants women to stop thinking about &quot;losing weight fast,&quot; and instead focus on loving their bodies for what they are and what they can do. Lindsey is a small-town Minnesota girl at heart turned world-champion skier, but that didn&#39;t come without hard work. In &lt;em&gt;Strong Is the New Beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, Lindsey lays out the never-before-seen training routines and her overall philosophy that have helped her become the best female skier in the world&amp;#8212;tailored for women of all shapes and sizes. Lindsey backs up her fitness program with advice on what to eat and how to work out, and kicks readers into high-gear, helping bolster their self-confidence and build a better body image, with the tips and tricks she&#39;s learned as a pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Lindsey&#39;s regimen, and she encourages people to take from it what will work for them. She bounced back from injury not by doing every single thing a trainer said, but instead, by thinking about the fitness plan that would work for her, and eating the right foods that would make her feel and get healthy. In &lt;em&gt;Strong Is the New Beautiful,&lt;/em&gt; she interweaves her training and diet regimen with compelling stories of her life growing up in the heartland, her love of skiing, the challenges she&#39;s faced&amp;#8212;including injuries, illness, and depression&amp;#8212;and her secrets to wellness, fitness, and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by cutting-edge science and the latest studies on health and exercise, filled with routines even those hitting the bunny hill of working out can master, and illustrated with dozens of workout shots and photos from Lindsey&#39;s own collection, &lt;em&gt;Strong Is the New Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; will inspire and motivate you&amp;#8211;whether you&#39;re an aspiring athlete, want to get back into shape, or are eager to up your game&amp;#8212;to make your body stronger than ever before, inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
