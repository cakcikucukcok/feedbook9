  <title>MOTHERHOOD - IS IT FOR ME?: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Clarity - Denise L Carlini, Ann Davidman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many women question whether they want a baby or a childfree life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Motherhood &amp;ndash; Is It For Me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;is the perfect resource for addressing this crucial life choice. Find out what&amp;nbsp;family planning&amp;nbsp;might really mean for you with this insightful book, which offers every woman a clear path to understanding her ambivalence, moving through it, and making an informed decision about becoming a mother or remaining childfree.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For partnered and single women alike, this self-help guide will lead you to your truth, gently and nonjudgmentally, using a series of exercises that will enable you to navigate through your immobilization. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to let go of external circumstances that cloud the motherhood decision. No one can make the motherhood decision for you, but this self-help guide for women will help you to say hello to a new future&amp;mdash;one of clarity and brightness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Motherhood &amp;ndash; Is It For Me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;can be read and used individually or in a women&amp;rsquo;s group. Many women feel that there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to turn when they can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether or not to become mothers; they&amp;rsquo;re unsure how to think about family planning. Some think they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a mother at all, or they might be deciding whether to become pregnant after 35 and have a baby. In all of these circumstances, women can feel lonely, isolated and debilitated. If you have these feelings, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone; so, whether you read&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Motherhood &amp;ndash; Is It For Me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;as an individual or in a women&amp;rsquo;s group, doing the exercises will lead you to clarity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This self-help guide includes 20 stories from women of diverse backgrounds who share their decision-making journeys; half of these women chose motherhood while half decided on a childfree life. These women&amp;rsquo;s stories create a valuable, supportive community by breaking the isolation that women often feel when they don&amp;rsquo;t know their own truths about motherhood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors of this book, who are both licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, created the Motherhood-Is it for me?&amp;trade; program in 1991&amp;mdash;it has had more than 25 years of proven success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Motherhood &amp;ndash; Is It For Me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;brings the methods used in that innovative, insightful program to paperback or e-book.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Motherhood &amp;ndash; Is It For Me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;provides the path to a woman&amp;rsquo;s deepest desire so that she can make the motherhood decision that feels right for her. It&amp;rsquo;s a must-read if you&amp;rsquo;re undecided.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
