  <title>The Knowledge - Don Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Power of Knowing How Life Works; is a true life experience. The Knowledge has arrived through me, for you, explaining to all of us the facts about How Life Works. The missing piece of the humanity puzzle has been found. I am referring to the understanding of how everyday life works. I leave open all religious and scientific possibilities for you to apply, as you see fi t. My only goal is to share The Knowledge that has arrived through me for you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wondered how the universe began; how our physical beings manage the maze of life, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE? I am able to provide for you The Power of Knowing How Life Works. An intriguing new look into where your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and emotions reside and how your thoughts control the world you live in and create your reality. On November 17th, 2009 @ 6:24 AM wide awake, no dreams, no near death experience, I was provided The Knowledge that will answer all of your questions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you think the answers have previously arrived, ask yourself a simple question: How is it working so far? We have poverty, war, greed, depression and confusion throughout the world. The prisons are bursting at the seams; people are losing jobs, their homes, and their dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You too can possess The Power of Knowing How Life works, the issue is; will you be open enough to accept The Knowledge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
