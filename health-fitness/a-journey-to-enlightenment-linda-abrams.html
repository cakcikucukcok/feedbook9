  <title>A Journey to Enlightenment - Linda Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A JOURNEY TO ENLIGHTENMENT is a journey to the light within each of us. Most people instinctively know there is a greater power at the core of creation. We have named that power God and have created many religions to celebrate God. Religions at their basis teach love and the Golden Rule but unfortunately because mankind has interjected their opinions into the mix there has been great separation between religions and people on this planet. Most of the wars have been fought because of the differences in interpretation that religions have. Each religion believes they are the one true path to God. But with all of the many religions which one is the one true way? 
We have learned to give our power to people outside of ourselves thus making ourselves powerless. It is time we turned within to the power inside of each of us, our heart, Soul, and God within. For it is there and only there that our true power lies.
God is not outside of us as many religions have inferred. When we wake up and remember our authentic self as an aspect of the Creator is when the Journey to Enlightenment happens. We are much more then these bodies we inhabit. We are an Eternal Spirit focused in these human forms having a human experience, with powers and abilities far beyond our imagining. One of these powers is the ability to co-create with all of creation. Have you heard the expression, Thoughts become things? What we think goes forth from us and it takes form in this world we live in. At this time we are moving from the third dimensional frequency to the fifth, which is assisting us to remembering our Divine self. Allow me to assist you on your Journey To Enlightenment." />
