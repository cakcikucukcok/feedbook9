  <title>Wasted: An Alcoholic Therapist&#39;s Fight for Recovery in a Flawed Treatment System - Michael Pond, Maureen Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Psychotherapist Michael Pond is no stranger to the devastating consequences of alcoholism. He has helped hundreds of people conquer their addictions, but this knowledge did not prevent his own near-demise. In this riveting memoir, he recounts how he lost his practice, his home, and his family&amp;#151;all because of his drinking. After scores of visits to the ER, a tour of hellish recovery homes, a stint in intensive care for end-stage alcoholism, and jail, Pond devised his own personal plan for recovery. He met Maureen Palmer and together they investigated scientific alternatives to the rigid abstinence doctrine pushed by 12-Step programs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
