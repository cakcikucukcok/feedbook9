  <title>The Liberty Club - Marianne Aleck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Liberty Club is a non-fiction, layered family memoir that follows the lives of a Greek and French family through their true life adventures that the author coined, &amp;quot;A slice of Americana with a European twist.&amp;quot; Beginning at the turn of the 20th century the story embarks as the Greeks immigrate to America&amp;nbsp;through Ellis Island,&amp;nbsp;settling in a&amp;nbsp;northern California town that sprouted from the Gold Rush. You&amp;#39;ll learn of their struggles and ingenuity, and how the Greeks adapted in America, while still&amp;nbsp;preserving their rich European&amp;nbsp;traditions. Timeless stories of life during the Great Depression are told through the eyes of youngsters, while alternately the French side shows a completely different mood, and lifestyle during the same era. Arranged marriages were the norm of the times, and how they played out was anyones guess.&amp;nbsp; The split narrative adds to the pace and mystery of their tales, finding both families affected in much different ways by the onset of WWII.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two bloodlines come together during the war, with a torrid romance between the Greek-American born soldier and his French beauty, complicated by Hitlers Panzers. Vividly portrayed accounts of famous battles from a soldiers perspective, and life endured under German occupation are palpable through first hand accounts.&amp;nbsp; All that, and you&amp;#39;re only halfway through this riveting tale. With close to two hundred pictures and images filling the pages from beginning to end, the characters, places, and events are brought to life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Liberty Club is a state of mind, an inner drive, and a place in time.&amp;nbsp;Within each player a story is born, sacrifices are made, love is found, and love is lost. &amp;nbsp;What compels the true life characters throughout these pages? &amp;nbsp;What drives them to their choices, and ultimate consequences? &amp;nbsp;And what inspired the narrator to research and write for almost four years uncovering every scrap, every morsel about the lives of her ancestors? &amp;nbsp;The answer to the latter; an undying curiosity, deep familial love, and nostalgia for a by-gone era of those who lived before us. Those, who lived to become known as The Greatest Generation. &amp;nbsp;The Liberty Club is this authors tribute to a generation who unwittingly set a high bar for the rest of us to strive for, while holding her families amazing journeys, gently between pages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
