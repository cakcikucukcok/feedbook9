  <title>2 Words 2 Live By - Mark Madden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all want to improve our lives. It seems like a daunting task-but does it have to be? Not according to author Mark Madden. In his book 2 Words 2 Live By, he shows us that living better doesn&amp;#39;t have to be hard work. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be complicated. Mark reveals to us that a simple pair of words has the power to inspire, motivate, and transform. Practical wisdom is revealed in the form of two-word phrases: Live Modestly. Persevere Always. Encourage Someone. These phrases open our eyes to the small steps right in front of us, small steps that lead to big changes. The affirmations in 2 Words 2 Live By supply nearly a year&amp;#39;s worth of inspiration in all aspects of life-physical, mental, social, spiritual-for people of any age, whether it&amp;#39;s a graduate, someone facing a life change, or a dear friend celebrating a milestone birthday. No matter where you are on your journey, you can change your life-two words at a time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
