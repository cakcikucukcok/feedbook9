  <title>&quot;For the Love of Matthew&quot; Growing up with Down Syndrome - Janice Credit Houska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The story of Matthew begins in the labor room when he is born at just 4 pounds 10 ounces.   Happiness abounds until the next day, a doctor tells the parents he suspects Matthew has Down syndrome.
&lt;P&gt;What follows is an anguish that only a parent who has been through this would understand. The process of grieving for the loss of a normal child is followed day by day until the determination to make things right takes the place of guilt, sadness and anger. Matthew&#39;s mother&#39;s determination and belief that her son could learn anything (even though the doctors gave the parents little hope for Matthew abilities to learn or even being able to take care of himself) proved the &quot;experts&quot; wrong.   Her methods are outlined in the story, which included mountains of word cards and a constant flow of stimulation. He was reading his first few words at three years old and by the time he was ten he was playing the piano.  Matthew&#39;s story tells of the hills and valleys one encounters in daily life, in school and in the community.   You will share with Matthew the anguish at the death of a cherished grandmother, a dear grandfather with alzhiemers and many other tragedies that dot his young life.   The story tells of his experiences in school, from preschool to high school, which is a mixture of highs and lows.    His talent in music is realized and by the time he is seventeen, he is playing the piano,harmonica, xylophone and guitar.   
Heartwarming, sad, funny and a must for parents who are facing similar challenges." />
