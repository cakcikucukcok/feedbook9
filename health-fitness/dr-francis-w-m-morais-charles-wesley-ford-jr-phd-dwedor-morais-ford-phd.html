  <title>Dr. Francis W. M. Morais - Charles Wesley Ford Jr., PhD, Dwedor Morais Ford, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the advocacy and struggles of Francis W. M. Morais (1866-1964), Ph.D., D.Lit. Between 1927 and 1935, Dr. Morais worked tirelessly to put an end to slavery, forced labor, and ethnic discrimination in Liberia. Liberia was founded as a safe haven for freed people of color in the early 1800s. Morais fight for human rights for Liberias indigenous population compelled him to travel to Geneva to make the case to the League of Nations. The Liberian Government did all within its power to prevent his travel to Europe, but he persevered. For over a year, he was marooned between Geneva and London without funds. Rescued through financial assistance from those who believed in his fight, Morais returned home to a short-lived heros welcome. Within hours, he was arrested without writ and sent to Bella Yallah prison for fifteen years. He was released after six months and tried for treason.&lt;/p&gt;" />
