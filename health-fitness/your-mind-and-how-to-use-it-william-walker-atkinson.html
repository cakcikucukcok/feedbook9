  <title>Your Mind and How to Use It - William Walker Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your Mind and How to Use It: A Manual of Practical Psychology by William Walker Atkinson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mind is defined as &amp;quot;the faculty or power whereby thinking creatures, feel, think, and will.&amp;quot; This definition is inadequate and circular in nature, but this is unavoidable, for mind can be defined only in its own terms and only by reference to its own processes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the simplest method of conveying the idea of the existence and nature of the mind is that attributed to a celebrated German teacher of psychology who was wont to begin his course by bidding his students think of something, his desk, for example. Then he would say, &amp;quot;Now think of that which thinks about the desk.&amp;quot; Then, after a pause, he would add, &amp;quot;This thing which thinks about the desk, and about which you are now thinking, is the subject matter of our study of psychology.&amp;quot; The professor could not have said more had he lectured for a month." />
