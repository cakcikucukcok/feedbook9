  <title>Our Boys Speak - John Nikkah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Nikkah asked one simple question: What do the boys think?  From the best-selling Ophelia Speaks to the &quot;girl power&quot; movement, teenage girls are speaking their minds and having their due.  But what about the boys?  Aside from the works of a few academics, there seems to be no outlet in today&#39;s media for the true voices of teen-age boys.  Until now.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John contacted over 5,000 schools across the country looking for the voices of America&#39;s boys.  What are their goals, their fears, their hopes, their dreams?  What are their lives really like as they stand on the verge of manhood?  &lt;i&gt;Our Boys Speak&lt;/i&gt; takes the best of hundreds of entries from boys aged 12-18 from varied racial, economic, religious, and regional backgrounds.  The essays, poems, diary entries and stories cover topics ranging from sex and dating, sports, religion, depression, violence, video games, family, and just about everything in between.  And narrating the essays is John Nikkah, who comes to new understandings about his own teenage years through the raw voices he encounters.  This is a book for parents, for teens, for educators and for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Boys Speak&lt;/i&gt; is just that.  It is our sons, our friends, our neighbors, our families, ourselves.  Sometimes painful, sometimes joyful, &lt;i&gt;Our Boys Speak&lt;/i&gt; is most of all truthful and real.&lt;/p&gt;" />
