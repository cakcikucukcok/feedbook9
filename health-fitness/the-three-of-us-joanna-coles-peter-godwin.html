  <title>The Three of Us - Joanna Coles, Peter Godwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are guides to every aspect and every angle of parenthood-from prenatal to post-college-yet none tells us what couples really and truly feel once confronted with the awesome power of Nature&#39;s Course. &lt;i&gt;The Three of Us&lt;/i&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasoned travelers, successful professionals, Joanna Coles and Peter Godwin arrived in Manhattan ready to make it their oyster-she to be the New York correspondent for a major British newspaper, he to pursue his prize-winning career as a writer and journalist. Of course they were self-absorbed; why come to New York, if not to explore every avenue of self-interest? The news that Joanna is pregnant, however, causes a massive shift in paradigm. Suddenly they are launched unsteadily but irrevocably toward an altogether new New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a series of mental ultrasounds,&lt;i&gt; The Three of Us&lt;/i&gt; consists of alternating diary entries in which, day by day and month by month, Peter and Joanna navigate the uncharted waters of impending parenthood. There is much to discuss-the pros and cons of raising a child in a neighborhood frequented by transvestite prostitutes, for example-yet their reactions are not always on the same page; male and female panic about the Joyous Event, as we learn, can differ sharply. But every parent-to-be, every parent-that-is, will recognize and rejoice in the wonderful, terrible, and sometimes hilarious anxieties that attend the building of a nest. &lt;i&gt;The Three of Us&lt;/i&gt; is a candid, refreshing, and reaffirming memoir about coming to terms with a new life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
