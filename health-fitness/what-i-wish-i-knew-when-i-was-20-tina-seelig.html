  <title>What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 - Tina Seelig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A revised and updated edition of the&amp;#160;international bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiring readers all over the globe to reimagine their future, this revised and updated edition of &lt;em&gt;What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20&lt;/em&gt; features new material to complement the classic text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major life transitions such as leaving the protected environment of school or starting a new career can be daunting. It is scary to face a wall of choices, knowing that no one is going to tell us if we make the right decision. There is no clearly delineated path or recipe for success. Even figuring out how and where to start can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As head of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, Tina Seelig&amp;#8217;s job is to guide her students as they make the difficult transition from the academic environment to the professional world&amp;#8212;providing tangible skills and insights that will last a lifetime. Seelig is a wildly popular and award-winning teacher and in &lt;em&gt;What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 &lt;/em&gt;she shares with us what she offers her students &amp;#8211;provocative stories, inspiring advice, and a big dose of humility and humor. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;These pages are filled with captivating examples, from the classroom to the boardroom, of individuals defying expectations, challenging assumptions, and achieving unprecedented success. Seelig throws out the old rules and provides a new model for reaching our potential.&amp;#160; We discover how to have a healthy disregard for the impossible; how to recover from failure; and how most problems are remarkable opportunities in disguise.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I Wish I Knew When I Was Twenty&lt;/strong&gt; is a much-needed book for everyone looking to make their mark in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
