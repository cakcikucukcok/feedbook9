  <title>Romancing Your Career - Shabnam Asthana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Romancing Your Career is a must read for every professional who wants to make a success of his or her career. Its universal appeal lies in the fact that it introduces you to important facets of the corporate world, with easily identifiable characters who you will laugh with, cry with, pity, despise, and even get inspired by. These are inhabitants of your nine-to-five world and an integral part of your daily interaction at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your profession is a storehouse of immense learning, provided you are in a receptive mode. It provides you with ample opportunities and springboards to catapult to success. It also comes with its fair share of volatile situations, and it is for you to provide the safety switch of maturity and experience to prevent any short circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I write in the subsequent chapters is heartfelt and firsthand. I attempt to take you through some painful, some joyous, and some ooh la la moments of my career, which will leave an indelible mark on you, to either create or darken your own footprints of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I welcome you aboard your journey of wonder, enrichment, intrigue, and romance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
