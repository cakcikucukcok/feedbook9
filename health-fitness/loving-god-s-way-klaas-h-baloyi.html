  <title>Loving God’S Way - Klaas H Baloyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is not an expression but a powerful act to be demonstrated by those who choose to engage in or share it. Society has socialized people into believing love as something they do not have control over. Love continues to be viewed as a sudden occurrence that ambushes those who share it, without them giving a deep thought of what they are engaging themselves into.
As the phrase falling in love connotes, people have taken it for what it sounds on face value than an expressive phrase it actually is. Love cannot be a feeling but a choice. It is a conscious decision that one takes at a particular point. This book, therefore, seeks to demystify how love is not a feeling but a decision.
Yes! True love does exist. For one to experience it, it is important to understand its essence and how it unfolds. Gods philosophy of love provides a basis from which to understand and experience the beauty of love. That love which regards not of its own but of the other. Love is a peculiar partnership, which neither anticipates nor forces a contribution of the other partner. Engaging in a love relationship however, can set you on a path that determines whether you will experience heaven or hell on earth. Choosing right is therefore vital." />
