  <title>The Wooden Spoon - Rosalie Marino Demonte, Arthur A. Demonte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN lang=EN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Wooden Spoon &lt;/EM&gt;is, in essence, an Italian &lt;I&gt;Roots&lt;/I&gt;. The story traces the arrival of an Italian family from Sicily to America. Using actual historical events as a backdrop, we follow the family from being immigrants to fully mainstream Americans without them ever loosing their rich Italian culture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because the book is based on unverified stories told around the kitchen table [hence the changing of surnames], as well as actual events, &lt;I&gt;The Wooden Spoon&lt;/I&gt; is a compelling blend of fiction and non-fiction; a multi-cultural experience within a semi-autobiographical memoir. In many respects, it is also a womans story as well as the primary characters are women. The books title is derived from the women cooking in the kitchen, with an ever present wooden spoon, or at the kitchen table with coffee gossiping away.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Youll watch Maria and Rosarios six children grow and raise their own families; their eldest daughters (the authors mother and grandmother) youngest child (the author) meeting the man shell marry at the books conclusion. Along the way, the reader will bond with the family, making them their own. Theyll share countless laughs and spill many tears as they spend 54 years with the family.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another property of the book is that it embraces the beloved aspects of the Godfather type stories with very, very little Mafia references. It was the psychodynamics of an Italian family which sustained those stories. Here, the family IS the story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you liked &lt;EM&gt;Moonstruck&lt;/EM&gt;, you&#39;ll love &lt;EM&gt;The Wooden Spoon&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
