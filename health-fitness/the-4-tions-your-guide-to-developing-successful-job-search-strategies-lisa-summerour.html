  <title>The 4-Tions: Your guide to developing successful job search strategies - Lisa Summerour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="-      Not since the depths of the Great Depression have job seekers faced a more challenging and competitive employment environment.  Who will survive and even thrive under economic conditions reminiscent of our country&#39;s darkest economic era?  Fortunately, authors Rahim, Holloway, and Summerour have condensed what it takes to identify and secure meaningful employment in today&#39;s grueling job market into four time tested, research proven and fundamental concepts ...the 4-Tions: Documentation, Preparation, Presentation and Communication.  As a job creator and serial, social entrepreneur it has been my greatest responsibility to hire and supervise the talent of entry-level through professional employees to perform critical services in high-risk, high-needs environments for over 20 years.  My strategic advantage within my marketplace is found within my employees.  Accordingly, in every hiring decision, the 4-Tions have been indispensable to and decisive in my strategic employment process.  I require that my prospective employees document impeccable credentials, indicate significant prior knowledge about my companies, exhibit excellent communication skills, and demonstrate a superior level of professionalism appropriate to their tasks.  In addition, I require that my employees display the ability to leave a lasting positive impression on my clients and customers by being the most knowledgeable people in the room in their area of expertise at all times.  In fact, the 4-Tions is more than a practical, user-friendly guide to successfully gaining employment in a highly competitive environment.  It also encourages life-long learning and facilitates networking through effective and efficient use of social media and other technology.
