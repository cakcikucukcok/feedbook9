  <title>A Little Book of Permission - S L Sourwine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if giving yourself permission to follow your dreams starts with becoming more aware of what you aren&amp;#39;t required to do? &amp;nbsp;How aware are you of the hidden list of all the have to&amp;#39;s, shoulds, ought to&amp;#39;s, and&amp;nbsp;musts you&amp;#39;ve agreed to in your life? &amp;nbsp;A Little Book of Permission is a&amp;nbsp;curated list of things you don&amp;#39;t have to do which takes the reader on a funny journey towards self determination and recognising&amp;nbsp;choices we sometimes forget we have. &amp;nbsp;It won&amp;#39;t take you long to read. &amp;nbsp;It isn&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp;an exhaustive list that will instantly free&amp;nbsp;you from all the obligations that we sometimes mistake for our choices. &amp;nbsp;It will hopefully make you exhale a bit, laugh a couple of times, and perhaps ask yourself some questions about what it is you want to do with your short, precious time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for A Little Book of Permission:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A Little Book of Permission is&amp;nbsp;the kind&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;book&amp;nbsp;that sticks with you.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s poetic but not exactly&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;poem. The gift is in the message which lands like something the Dalai Lama would write but reads more like Dr. Seuss.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s one&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;those books you grow up with and re-read at just the right moments. It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;perfect&amp;nbsp;book&amp;nbsp;for ages 10-100+.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Betsy Blankenbaker, author of Beyond O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sourwine has crafted a meditation on letting go of our inner and outer critics. She gives us permission to be ourselves, and sets us free from the shackles of an uptight, controlling society. A liberating book that can be read over and over, or one line at a time to give yourself a new freedom every day.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Stephen Roxborough, author of Ego to Earthschool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The most amazing thing about this little book is the amount of encouragement and power it provides. It reminds me that it&amp;#39;s ok to not do things. It&amp;#39;s ok to take time out for myself, to not clean the house, to not do any of the other things on my never-ending to do list. I give myself permission to be me, all the time.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Susan Trunk, Trunk Travel Studio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Author:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SL Sourwine lives beside a shingle beach on the edge of the English Channel trying to keep all of the bits of her passions moving in approximately the same direction.&amp;nbsp; This involves lots of walking with her Old English Sheepdog companion Alfred.&amp;nbsp; Building a twenty-year career in international horse racing with only her passion for horses, the sport, and an English degree, her experiences ranged from being the volunteer flower gardener at the tiniest of courses in Saskatchewan, Canada to being involved with a winner at Royal Ascot.&amp;nbsp; Going on to start her own consulting company, the freedom to work on innovative projects led her to founding a new technology company and to finally start to get some books out of her head and onto paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
