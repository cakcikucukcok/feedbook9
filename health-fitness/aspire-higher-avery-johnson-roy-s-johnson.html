  <title>Aspire Higher - Avery Johnson, Roy S. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Avery Johnson is a coach, a teacher, and sometimes even a preacher, but most of all, he is a motivator, driving his team with the same fiery passion that allowed him to earn his championship credentials as an NBA player. Growing up in New Orleans&#39;s Lafitte Housing Project, he was never the biggest, fastest, or strongest, but by the strength of his will and character, he persevered. Now he offers the lessons he learned on his journey from the bottom of the bayou to the heights of success in this inspiring book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspire Higher&lt;/em&gt; is the essential game plan for reaching your goals. Johnson begins by outlining what it takes to get to the top: determination and discipline provide the foundation that allows you to make the right decisions, on the basketball court or in the boardroom. The goal isn&#39;t just to be successful, however; it&#39;s also about caring for other people along the way. &amp;#8220;I care about you more than I care about winning,&amp;#8221; Johnson often tells his players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avery Johnson&#39;s personal and professional experiences illuminate crucial lessons, inspiring readers just as he has inspired teammates and players. His spirited message is for anyone looking for the tools and secrets of success in business, school, sports, and more&amp;#8212;anyone looking to aspire higher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
