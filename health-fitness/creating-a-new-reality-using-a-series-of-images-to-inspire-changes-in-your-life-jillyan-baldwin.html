  <title>Creating a New Reality Using a Series of Images to Inspire Changes in Your Life - Jillyan Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;A STEP BY STEP GUIDANCE WITH JILLYAN&lt;/br&gt;
TO CREATE THE ULTIMATE YOU&lt;/br&gt;
YOUR POTENTIAL FUTURE&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this self-help book Jillyan offers her readers and viewers a culmination of her experience, based on many years of working with clients in different countries, as a &lt;i&gt;personal session&lt;/i&gt; for each reader. As she has assisted people from a wide range of different cultures and age groups, this &lt;i&gt;personal session&lt;/i&gt; offers guidance step by step through various aspects of peoples lives toward their own potential also creating new realities. Her paintings being &lt;i&gt;symbolic&lt;/i&gt;, aim to stimulate the viewers imagination, whereby each person can create changes and new realities within each aspect of their lives, as they progress through this book. Jillyan recognised her mind-body connection when she healed her headaches for life, when she was twelve years old. Her message within each part of this book aims at stimulating self-empowerment for each reader, that they have within them their own inner healer and that their thoughts and beliefs affect their physical bodies. Jillyans understanding of the mind-body connection, led her toward training with two different Hawaiian Kahunas, therefore after learning about the Seven Powerful Principles, she has included these within some parts of this book as a guide to understanding how thoughts and beliefs are creating peoples realities moment to moment. People in the world today are challenged in so many ways, resolving personal and family relationships, issues relating to work, professions, business, loss of loved ones, profit and loss concerning money and the list goes on. A wide range of issues are touched upon throughout this book, together with meditative exercises, to guide the reader toward creating a new reality in their lives. Readers can continue using this book whenever a new challenge has entered their lives, no matter how big or small. Families with teenagers can share ideas within the family, for when peace, love and understanding becomes part of the family unit, peace reaches out into the community, the nation and the outer world. We can all contribute to World Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JILLYANS MESSAGE: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a New Reality is not only the title and focus for this book, but has been my personal philosophy and for my clients over many years. I realised early on that having assisted my clients over the years, that it was time for me to reach my own potential in art as a painter. When I decided to write this book, I knew it would call upon all my inner resources challenging me to reach outside my comfort zone. My endeavour is to bring together within me, the healer, the painter and now the writer, therefore creating a third force. My personal session to each of my readers throughout this book, may also inspire the creation of each readers individual third force and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think your book will be helpful to people. Serge Kahili King Ph.D Author of &lt;i&gt;Urban Shaman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
