      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Inspiration can alter the way we live for the better. Inspiration means in spirit, and when you are in spirit, all things become abundant.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Disease, My Teacher&lt;/i&gt;  is based loosely on true events lived by author Matteo Charles. Diagnosed with an incurable disease, Matteo Charles thought his life was over as he knew it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Having multiple successful businesses and career paths crumble around him, there was no light at the end of Matteos tunnel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For this &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt;trepreneur, an injection of inspiration turned Matteos journey upside down and allowed him to find his true purpose, passion, and of course, his light.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fighting his hardest opponent (himself ) in the biggest match of his life, Matteo defied the odds, faced death, and proved that giving up wasnt an option.&lt;/P&gt;" />
