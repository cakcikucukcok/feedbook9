  <title>Happy Apples - One a day keeps depression away - Helen Back</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The new MUST-have, groundbreaking book on depression. Practical and direct. Happy Apples delivers results  in a short period of time without drugs!  Did you know that suicide accounts for more deaths globally than either armed conflicts or traffic accidents? The greatest risk factor for suicide is depression and it&#39;s time to concede that what we&#39;ve been doing to treat depression isn&#39;t working. Most treatments stem from an outdated medical model, a model reinforced by a multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry that manufactures drugs that supposedly &#39;cure&#39; it. Never mind that one of the many listed side-effects of such drugs include suicidal thoughts! The answer to depression is not necessarily medication.   Happy Apples gives you the latest information on depression-its links to REM sleep, anxiety, lifestyle and how we think. The book weaves scientific facts into a story that makes for easy and absorbing reading, offering practical, life-changing strategies to lead you or your loved ones out of despair. Helen Back fuses her own experience of depression with her expertise as a psychotherapist to teach you, your children and those you care about how to change behaviours, master emotions and build resilience.  Helen brilliantly presents the facts behind depression. The result is a book that peels back the science and psychology to give you profound understandings and much greater mastery of your emotions.  It will alter the way you see, and change the way you live. Everyone should read this book!  Helen Back is a practising Psychotherapist and Counsellor who ran a successful Harley Street Practice specialising in treating depression and anxiety. She consults with organisations on emotional resilience and mental health. Helen has been on Fox FM&#39;s Hamish &amp; Andy show and been a guest expert on MMM Radio, Australia and Capital FM, London. She has worked with clients from various walks of life from all over the world including the UK, the US, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. She now resides on Australia&#39;s beautiful Sunshine Coast with her husband and two JackRussells." />
