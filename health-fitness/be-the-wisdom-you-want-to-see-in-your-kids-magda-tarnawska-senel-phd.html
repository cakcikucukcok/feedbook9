  <title>Be the Wisdom You Want to See in Your Kids. - Magda Tarnawska Senel, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although most parents rate having children as the most meaningful experience of their lives, many find themselves pushed to their emotional and physical limits. Parenthood affords us the opportunity to become more compassionate, patient and understanding, but we also run the risk of becoming more irritable, impatient and intolerant. This book shows readers how they can transform everyday challenges into sources of empowerment and inspiration by demonstrating that joyful living and soulful parenting is not something that just happens by itself; it is a result of choices we make every day. It also presents several proven models for effectively achieving higher levels of fulfillment and a variety of creative activities for both parents and children. By guiding readers to find their own answers to such questions as: What is the difference between a person who is unable to live a happy life and one who succeeds in living with a rich feeling of fulfillment? How do we arrive at adulthood behaving the way we do? this book helps parents discover their most authentic and inspired selves and focus on raising joyful, happy and successful children who develop to their fullest potential." />
