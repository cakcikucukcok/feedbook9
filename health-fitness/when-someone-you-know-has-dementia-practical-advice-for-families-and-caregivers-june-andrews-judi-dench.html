  <title>When Someone You Know Has Dementia: Practical Advice for Families and Caregivers - June Andrews, Judi Dench</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Across the world, almost 50 million people have dementia. Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the dementia of parents, partners, siblings, or friends. And while many countries are learning to cope with aging populations, dementia is becoming ever more of a challenge for many societies and individuals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Huge numbers of people who are diagnosed, or who are dealing with the diagnosis of a loved one, feel alone. &lt;I&gt;When Someone You Know Has Dementia&lt;/I&gt; aims to fill this gap, providing practical information and support for people living with, or caring for someone with, dementia. It also provides insight into what is happening when a person has dementia as well as describing what dementia is, how you can deal with it, and what you can do to keep dementia at bay. Because the book offers information that has been unavailable to nurses and doctors, clinicians will also find it helpful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most important, the book takes an honest approach, emphasizing the needs of the person who has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s or dementia while also giving attention to the needs of caregivers and families. The book is packed with practical tips for providing what people with Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s or dementia want and need and includes many quotes from people living with or affected by dementia. With clear and sensible information about recognizing symptoms, getting help, managing financially, staying at home, getting treatment, being a caregiver, and staying positive, this guide will help people with dementia and their families make sure that they can stay well and happy as long as possible.&lt;/div&gt;" />
