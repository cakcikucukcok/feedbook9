  <title>Attacking Myasthenia Gravis: A Key in the Battle Against Autoimmune Diseases - Ronald Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Using his insight as a longtime physician, Dr. Ron Henderson describes the productive life he lives despite having a rare autoimmune disease known as myasthenia gravis (MG). He also provides a forum for three other MG patients to share their inspirational stories. A disease unfamiliar to many, myasthenia gravis means &quot;grave muscle weakness&quot; and causes severe weakness and loss of strength in voluntary muscles in various parts of the body. Often debiliating, MG falls into the category of &quot;autoimmune&quot; diseases, which all involve problems related to the immune system. Explaining MG symptoms, treatments, research, and disease-management tips, this book becomes a useful guide for MG patients, their families, and their physicians. And the book goes further. Using MG as an example, Dr. Henderson and others provide tips to all who suffer from chronic health problems for which there are treatments but no cures. Forced by MG to retire eight years ago as an obstetrician-gyne-cologist, Dr. Henderson now enjoys improved health but realizes he can never expect to be well unless a cure is found for MG. In this book, he announces plans to expand research into MG and other autoimmune disease through his founding of the International Autoimmune Disease Research Foundation." />
