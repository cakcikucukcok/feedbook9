  <title>The Laws of Nature for a Better Business - Christopher John Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
What really grabs you about this book is the way it goes from leadership all the way to personal mastery without missing a beat. It&#39;s a great handbook for any person who wants to have a meaningful work life without blowing their health or their relationship along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Walker doesn&#39;t fake it either. He&#39;s grounded the book with the Laws of Nature so, there&#39;s no theory about how things should be or could be at work. He highlights the importance of the culture and how for businesses to grow having the right knowledge and tools is not enough if the culture does not evolve/adapt with it fast enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His &#39;Aussie&#39; attitude comes across really &#39;matter-of-fact&#39; and that really is refreshing when most business teachers and consultants are still in starched collars and formal ties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s obvious that this book comes from real life experience and the section for good self mastery looks like Walker is recounting his 30 years in business, trying to help the rest of us not fall into the same ruts and grooves that don&#39;t work. Like wise news for young shoulders.
&lt;/p&gt;
