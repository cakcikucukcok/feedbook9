  <title>Love U with All My Heart! - Robin Stolz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Love U with All My Heart is a texted verse every day from dear old Mom. These are just a few that I picked to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned what being faithful to my girls can be, by finding a verse, and I have been blessed by looking to His Word as I have become faithful to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge each of you to take this journey with your kids, your husbands, and yourself. I know I didnt get what I was thinking I would by the girls looking for their verse, but every day they got one from the Lord because I never gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont give up. Our Lord is always waiting for us to see Him, hear Him, and enjoy our walks with Him! Who knows how many of these verses my girls will be able to bring out of their hearts filing cabinet just because we texted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love u with all my heart! &lt;br /&gt;A mom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Now its your turn to text on Gods message!&lt;/p&gt;
