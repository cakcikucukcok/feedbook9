  <title>Get Naked: - Debra Payne PhD, Lynda Brown PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Get Naked, we will teach you tools and skills to help you become aware of the influence of limiting beliefs and how to keep them from dominating your life. You will discover how to: 
 Adopt the mindset that you are enough. 
 Release overwhelming fear, worry, and guilt. 
 Free yourself from needing approval. 
 Stop being driven by negativity. 
 Relinquish habits of muscling for control. 
 Surrender pessimistic thoughts. 
 Quit being held hostage by your emotions. 
 Kiss the practice of prizing victimhood goodbye. 
Getting Naked begins with loving yourself. When you love yourself, you allow yourself to be imperfect. Some things will be left undone. You may not get approval from everyone. But, Dear Reader, In order for life to change, you are going to have to think, feel and do some things differently. After all, if you keep doing the same things, you will keep getting the same results. Ah, but there are rewards on the other side! Once you dare to Get Naked, life changes.
