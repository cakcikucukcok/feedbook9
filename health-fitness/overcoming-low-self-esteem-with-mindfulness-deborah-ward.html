  <title>Overcoming Low Self-Esteem with Mindfulness - Deborah Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Low self-esteem affects every aspect of our lives, from our career choices to our relationships, creating a life that leaves us feeling unaccepted and unfulfilled. When we feel that we are not good enough, we may avoid work and social opportunities and settle for less than we deserve. Overcoming Low Self-esteem with Mindfulness looks at how mindfulness can help us to wake up from the bad dream of negative thinking and see where our own thoughts, beliefs and reactions have led to poor choices. With a strong focus on the latest mindfulness studies, this book shows how to clear mental clutter and see the truth of who we are so that we can make healthy choices for ourselves. In this warm and well-researched book, Deborah Ward says that when we focus on the present moment and live our own lives according to our own needs and values, we can develop a mindful life that builds our self-esteem and helps us to make loving and fulfilling choices." />
