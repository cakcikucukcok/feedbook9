  <title>Intentional Connections - Gloria O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it true that children are as vulnerable and innocent as we think they are? Adults view themselves as childrens teachers, mentors, counselors, overseers, and guides. In Intentional Connections, a marriage and family therapist explores a different paradigmone that supports the belief that children are capable of not just learning from us, but teaching us as well.
Gloria OBriens extensive professional background has included counseling parents with concerns that range from common behavioral problems to rare disabilities. She shares psychological theories, case studies, and real-life vignettes that suggest when we observe our interactions with our children more attentively, we uncover the many life lessons children provide. While including step-by-step instructions on how adults can avoid the obstacles that interfere with our ability to hear our children and achieve greater personal growth, OBrien provides specific guidance on how parents can
	distinguish their own identity from their childs identity;
	recognize emotional triggers from the past;
	separate emotions from logic and enhance decision-making;
	learn to empathize with children;
	identify and stop button-pushing behaviors.
&lt;i&gt;Intentional Connections&lt;/i&gt; helps adults to recognize roadblocks, develop more satisfying adult-child relationships, and embark on a journey of self-improvement." />
