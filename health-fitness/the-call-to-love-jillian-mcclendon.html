  <title>The Call to Love - Jillian McClendon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you struggle with the notion of loving people the way God has called you to? It is well known that God asks His children to love one another, yet living a life of love proves to be difficult in a society imbued with selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Theology on the topic of love is not lacking; even non-Christians will freely speak about love. Almost everyone in todays society speaks of love with great conviction, but their behavior speaks of selfishness. Why is it so hard to live in a loving way when we talk so freely about it? Why is it that we can say we love our neighbors, and yet our neighbors dont actually feel loved by us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jillian recognizes that there is a genuine need to have real-world advice on implementing Gods call to love. The Call to Love lays out practical steps that can help you make vital changes in your lifechanges that can help you shift your perspective and arrive at a place where you have more love to share. You may find yourself seeing others in a different light and feeling more able to love your neighbor with a true, godly loveand not just on Sunday morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know the theology. The Call to Love shows you how to live it! Take the plunge and go from talking about love to living a life of love. You can be the change that society is longing for. Get ready to change your life and your world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
