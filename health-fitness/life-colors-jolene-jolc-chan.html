  <title>Life Colors - &quot;Jolene &quot;&quot;JoLC&quot;&quot;&quot; Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life Colors is a curriculum designed for early childhood education that enriches the development and grooming of young children as they enter into the world. The world is enriching and full of colors of the rainbow spectrum, and how do we, as caregivers, enrich and give our children the chance to blossom into the fullest potential of their embodying character to face the demands of the world they will interact and engage with? A creative, interactive, and self-expressionist curriculum is what Life Colors provides as a platform for the child to explore and learn and develop their own unique individuality. We embrace their being and their uniqueness and individuality as strengths and promote positive behaviors whilst managing maladaptive or disruptive coping by identifying the stressful stimuli that they are reactive towards. Working with parents on a confidential trust, we will manage the stressors and deal with them appropriately so that the child can grow confidently in a wholesome environment. Challenging behaviors can be understood. At Life Colors, we embrace children to recognize their thoughts and feelings, then empowering them to engage in appropriate positive responses to stimuli in their environment. Life Colors adopts behavior modification through an eclectic approach of all the major theories in psychology. 
Happy adventuring!
