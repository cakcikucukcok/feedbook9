      <meta name="description" content="A Love Symphony
In Five Parts
For the unemployed, under-employed or employed--- and All Truth Seekers of every faith and cultural tradition ---The Healing Adagio is a new book written by Melony McGant where small poetic thoughts become big ideas that offer compassion, hope and inspiration in difficult and challenging times.

Sedrick Gardner, Sunil Gupta, Patricia Moore, Karen Piazza, Pamela Patrick, Norbu Tsering, and Dr. Glory Van Scott
 &quot;For Our Children 
&quot;I can only hope that our enthusiasm and desire for goodness becomes more poignant and real each passing day. May we learn to embody mercy and compassion for all so that all are safe and free to make good choices. May we live our lives as a good neighbors in loving prosperous communities of respect and tolerance. May we share our time together nurturing hearts and building strong peaceful, healing foundations of hope for children to explore and grow and share their many gifts with love. Call Me A Dreamer!&quot;
Melony McGant considers herself a seeker of truth quietly in service to those in need of guidance and positive thoughts.  She has spoken with thousands of people seeking new employment, shifting careers, exploring new life options and seeking spiritual re-assurance and the path to re-discovering joy.   
&quot;Reverend Melony McGants written words of wisdom, inspiration and encouragement,---travel beautifully off the pages of her new book The Healing Adagio.  The readers eyes behold words of her truly universal spirit---which touches your heart, and gently rocks your soul. Her timely messages of truth will gladden and uplift your day, and gladden and uplift your year! ---Producer, writer and choreographer,  Dr. Glory Van Scott
