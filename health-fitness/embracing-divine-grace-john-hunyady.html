  <title>Embracing Divine Grace - John Hunyady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his own words and style, John Hunyady describes his changing life circumstances and experiences. John was born in a German Saxon village in Transylvania, Romania where German and Romanian were spoken and rich traditions were practiced. Villagers farmed and gypsies sold wares.  As he grew, John worked with his father in a flour mill.
Johns story shows the turmoil that came with shifting political control. In 1940, Hungarians marched into Romania.  During World War II, his family became refugees, fled the Russian army, and eventually resettled in Germany in 1946.
Looking for a new life, John and a sister immigrated to Canada. Speaking no English, John went to work for a dairy farmer.  Years later he had his own dairy farm, a dear wife, and children. But in one terribly tragic moment Johns life changed.
You will meet a man who, because of his unwavering faith and trust in his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, has lived a life of victory rather than defeat, in spite of the trials and grief he has faced. John believes there is nothing able to separate him from Gods love which is in Christ Jesus his Lord." />
