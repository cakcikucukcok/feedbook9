  <title>Get in the Zone: Inspirational Quotes for Everyday Living - Beverley Childs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been spending time writing from the heart. A lot of what I write is from my own experiences and those Ive observed in friends and family. There are a lot of broken spirits among us. I want to be a part of the solution in building up myself, people and the spirit. The world has a way of tearing us down, it is important to guard our minds and heart so we can love and give the best of us. The mind is power and choosing our words carefully is important in shaping our future. It is said out of our mouth comes life or death I am choosing life. I want to continue my life journey in empowering myself and others with my words and presence. I want to inspire people to believe in themselves and know we are worthy of every good thing. Lets start empowering and building the soul. Get out of your way, embrace change and let the spirit guide you.
 My hopes for this book are that everyone who reads it will find peace, comfort and strength to push forward in times of doubt. In our darkest hours may we all find solitude in inspiring words and the examples and legacies of the past greats. Let every spirit be lifted and let joy come upon all who search and read. Let us continue to strengthen our minds, meditate on the good and guard our minds with the power of words. We must transform our lives first on the inside, before we can live our best on the outside." />
