  <title>The Years Fly By....But the Days Last Forever! - Cathy Durrenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Years Fly by  But the Days Last Forever! brings insight to parenting through the most influential and important book of all times: the Bible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily assertions and comments are made regarding the state of our children today along with the disarray of the family unit, but hope should not be lost! Difficulties and struggles within the family unit are not recent developmentsits just that now there is a greater number of people and more ways to hear about those problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James 4:14 asks, What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Choosing to raise your children in a manner that honors God is your responsibility, but this opportunity is fleeting and vitally important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Years Fly by  But the Days Last Forever! addresses such areas as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Discipline   Communication   Being a role model   Entitlement   Who we are in Christ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children are a gift from God. They are innocent, adaptable, and deserve to be taken care of. The world is vying for their attention, but parents must be the ones who direct and guide their steps. Life is full of choices. I hope that reading this will assist you as you raise your children and convince you to the core that this is the most important job you will ever hold!&lt;/p&gt;" />
