Why Read This Book?
I am a Team Coach with over 10yrs experience in creating High Performing Teams. Now I want to share my strategies with you because I want people to enjoy their work and feel that they are making a valued contribution.
Who could benefit from reading this book?
Anyone who leads a group of people, who need to work together to get something done. 
Whats different about my Team Coaching?
I give you the exercises that I have already tested with real teams. You can run those exercises with your own teams to gain the same results. This is not a theoretical book and there is no need to pay for psychological profiling or team games like building rafts to float across rivers! I take a quick and practical approach to getting teams to deliver business results.
What next?
Give it a go! I want you to practice these exercises with your current team and see and feel the results. I want you to become a successful and popular leader of people for the rest of your career. If this book helps then my job is done! Please feel free to share your experiences with me by emailing me at rwatson@bromptonassociates.com or visiting our website www.bromptonassociates.com." />
