  <title>365 Daze - Lesa Kelley Osborn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step into the chaotic life of a single, working mother diagnosed with breast cancer. Laugh a lot. Cry a little. Share Lesas most private momentsall with her tell-it-like-it-is Southern humor and warmth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesa Osborn, a divorced mom and career woman, was enjoying her suburban Atlanta life with her daughter and a new, mysteriously attractive boyfriend.  Nothing could have prepared her for the dreaded diagnosis: A highly aggressive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, her year of turmoil began.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In reality, Lesas predicament was one that thousands of women face daily, but this was &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Clinging to her job and health insurance, Lesa returned to work and juggled priorities at home while still recovering from surgery. Overwhelmed by real crises, and everyday frustrations, she did what any feisty Southern gal would do: she fought like hell, daring cancer and caustic people to get in her way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By sharing her eventful year with candor and self-depreciating humor, Lesa presents a view of life as an unexpected gift with a lesson or two in how to laugh and be grateful each day of every year.&lt;/p&gt;
