  <title>Get off the Bus - Peter Logan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get off the BUS was a wakeup call for me to realize that no matter what you as a human being may be facing in your life you have to every now and again slow down and re-evaluate where u are heading. And if you find yourself going in circles or just riding life daily routines without any of the goals you set being achieved than thats when you get off the bus. The bull shit undermining your stride to successes. Now the bus can represent anything thats blocking you from where you want to be in life. It took me forty one years to realize my bus and yes I had a few in the form of family friends and habits. That I do still deal with today. However unlike then I know who these people are and Im aware of the traps they set to hold me down. Where they were so I would be unsuccessful too. Or the ones who keep you close to them just to monitor your growth. Well Im here to tell you there is no man holding you back as they once use to say back in the days of the old.  I was shot in the back in the early nineties and later diagnose as Benign  Bi- Polar and having Post traumatic stress disorder. I thought my life was over because all my family did to me was use me. And once the jobs were done they then tried to degrade me. It took me thirty years to realize they were my Bus. Ill always love them but only now it will be from afar. Now being able to see my obstacles. I now feel the courage to push on towards my goals. First starting with the completion of this book. this book is the first of many to come we are a strong nation where the sky is the limit.  All you have to do is be in the game of life in order to win (in your goals). Its time to recognize your bus and the next time you see your stop dont let that negative friend, family, member not even youself stop you from getting off your bull shit. Dont let people stop you from being the happiest person that you want to be in life. Thank you again and god bless you all..Peace." />
