  <title>ARC Leadership: From Surviving to Thriving in a Complex World - Richard Boston, Peter Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At all levels and in all organisations, leaders face a rising tide of mistrust in a world that&#39;s increasingly complex and interconnected. If they are to survive and thrive, these leaders, their teams and their organisations are going to need to be simultaneously Authentic, Responsible and Courageous.   This is the first book to bring those three critical qualities together. It&#39;s heavily researched but eminently readable. It walks with you, not judging you. It accepts that these three ARC qualities can be hard to live up to, and it provides a practical programme for getting a whole lot better at it. In doing so, it will help you:   •   adopt new ways of thinking and leading in an increasingly complex world  •   increase people&#39;s trust in you and your organisation  •   navigate the conflicting priorities of diverse stakeholders  •   build better, more resilient teams that deliver far more than the sum of their parts  &quot;One of the most thought-provoking books I&#39;ve ever read. It&#39;s a book shareholders will be waving at CEOs.&quot;     Tim Patterson, Vice President, Nickelodeon  &quot;Positive, hopeful, intelligent, friendly, shrewd, eye-opening, evidence-based and incredibly generous. It challenges and supports us like a great coach or trainer would do... part character review, part campaign for personal overhaul.&quot;     Phil Hayes, Chairman, Management Futures  &quot;Business schools in particular would do well to pay attention: given what&#39;s gone on in corporations, they need to take greater responsibility for producing future leaders who aren&#39;t simply able to profitably grow a business, but are - to their core - Authentic, Responsible and Courageous.&quot;     Karen Lombardo, former Worldwide Head of Human Resources, Gucci Group" />
