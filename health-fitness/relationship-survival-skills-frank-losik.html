  <title>Relationship Survival Skills - Frank Losik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a step-by-step guide presented in a bite-sized format. It is designed to appeal to the palates of mature adults who have had or who are now experiencing problems in their social, business, or intimate relationships. 
The book is divided into five sections. Myths That Maim is a postcard-like series of sayings that cautions us about the hidden pitfalls of a mindless, bumper-sticker approach to life. Relationship Survival Kit is a humorously presented set of dos and don&#39;ts for couples in committed relationships. Mutual Support outlines the skills needed to nurture long-term meaningful relationships. We Need to Talk! teaches specific essential communications skills. And finally, Type Game helps the reader to identify their own Jungian/Myers-Briggs-based Personality Type." />
