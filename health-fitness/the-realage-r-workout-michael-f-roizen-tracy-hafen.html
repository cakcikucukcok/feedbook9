  <title>The RealAge(R) Workout - Michael F. Roizen, Tracy Hafen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael F. Roizen has empowered thousands of Americans to take control of their own destinies. How? His best-selling books, &lt;em&gt;RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Makeover, and YOU: The Owner&#39;s Manual,&lt;/em&gt; have helped people reverse their chronological aging by ten, fifteen, and up to &lt;em&gt;twenty-nine&lt;/em&gt; years by revealing simple lifestyle changes that have profound effects that control their genes -- and thus control their health and the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are you picked up this book because you, too, want to be healthier and younger. &lt;em&gt;The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Workout&lt;/em&gt; explains the importance of gradually phasing exercise into your everyday routine, because even the smallest changes in behavior can make you feel, look, and be younger. No matter how busy your schedule, Dr. Michael Roizen will show you how to gain the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; age-reduction benefits from a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; amount of time and effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you take your first step, &lt;em&gt;The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Workout&lt;/em&gt; offers a series of calculations that factor in age, genetics, and lifestyle so you can determine your overall status of health and create a program to help you plan and execute your goals. &lt;em&gt;The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Workout&lt;/em&gt; then begins with a simple, yet life-changing premise -- just by walking 30 minutes a day, every day, you can roll back the years, significantly improve the status of your overall health, and have more energy to work and do the things you love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you&#39;ve adjusted to this change in your lifestyle, The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Workout will guide you through a series of training phases during which you will steadily develop your foundation muscles and eventually add a stamina-building program to help you maintain improved health. You will learn how to lift weights safely and effectively through step-by-step instructions with photographs and easy-to-understand explanations. Additionally, there are charts that help you determine the RealAge effect -- the number of biological years younger you become with each change you make. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, &lt;em&gt;The RealAge&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#174;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Workout&lt;/em&gt; dis-cusses common myths, addresses frequently asked questions pertaining to age and lifestyle choices, and offers tips to actually enjoy, yes, even love, exercise. So get ready to achieve optimal health and be as young as you can be! &lt;/p&gt;" />
