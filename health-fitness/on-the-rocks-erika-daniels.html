  <title>On the Rocks - Erika Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the Rocks is the story of my journey through the death of my marriage, and the days, weeks and years that led up to to the hot summer day when my husband announced that he wanted a divorce.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it looked like we had it all: happy, healthy kids, successful careers, a beautiful home in the country, cars and toys and travel. On the inside, we had physical and emotional abuse, addiction to alcohol, little lies and bigger ones, and an affair that shattered whatever trust I even had left. In the end, I learned the hard way that we can&#39;t trust anyone else until we learn to trust ourselves, and the voice that speaks inside all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You did such a good job of conveying how you were feeling. I think a lot of women will be able to relate and I think it can also help other women who will be nodding their heads, saying Amen while reading it! LOVE! A real father would not watch his wife leave her children when he should have been the one to go. I found myself saying out loud and in tears, So true! - J.M.&lt;/p&gt;" />
