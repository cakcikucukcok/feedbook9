  <title>Escape Your Weight - Edward J. Jackowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Last year, according to The Institute of Medicine, Americans spent in excess of &lt;b&gt;$33 billion&lt;/b&gt; on weight-loss products and services.  However, the economic cost of obesity in the USA was about &lt;b&gt;$117 billion&lt;/b&gt; during this same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously a dilemma exists.  Why? If all we needed to do was take a magic pill, exercise 10 minutes a day, or eliminate carbs from our diet, as so many &quot;Get-Thin-Quick&quot; schemes suggest, then why are so many of us still vastly overweight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such easy schemes do not tell the whole story about what we need to do to get fit and stay fit.   And because we&#39;re all different.  We think differently, we eat differently, and we exercise (or don&#39;t) differently. So we need diet and exercise plans designed especially for us.  Whether we&#39;re 10 pounds overweight or 25 pounds overweight.  Whether we like to exercise or whether we loathe exercise.  Whether we can stick to a diet six days a week or 3 days a week.  Whether we can exercise every day or twice a week.  &lt;i&gt;Escape Your Weight&lt;/i&gt; gives you a choice of eating plans and exercise plans that fit you, your likes and dislikes, your strengths and your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With expertly photographed exercise plans that are easy even for beginners, along with minimal, inexpensive equipment (no gym required), &lt;i&gt;Escape Your Weight&lt;/i&gt; will explain what YOU need to do  and what YOU need to eat to become slim and fit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
