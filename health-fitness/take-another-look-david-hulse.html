  <title>Take Another Look - David Hulse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If you are in the process of re-examining old childhood beliefs and have realized there has to be a more excellent way, this book is for you. With this in mind, I invite you to Take Another Look at some of the most important tenants of fundamental Judeo-Christian dogma. We will explore these basic ideas from the cultural context in which they were experienced and written, as well as the influences of the translators. This will take us from a fear-based message to the Gospel, or good news, with a love-based premise.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this day, there are several versions of the Bible. I suggest choosing the version which best suits your understanding of language. II Timothy 2:15 says: Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. The study presented in this book is based on the Thompson Chain-Reference Bible, Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, the guidance of the inner teacher - the Holy Spirit, and spiritual &lt;I&gt;common sense&lt;/I&gt;. The result has challenged much of the second-handed information that has been passed down through Christian patriarchy. This scripture also mentions, rightly dividing the word of truth. To do this, we need to discern which scriptures are inspired by God and which scriptures contain man&#39;s perceptions and hidden political and cultural agenda&#39;s.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I ask that you listen to your own inner Christ intelligence which is able to lead you into all truth, rather than listening to the feeble attempts of men&#39;s voices on the paths that seem right, who are only plunging us into the depths of unanswered questions, ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. &lt;/P&gt;
