  <title>The Other F Word - Juliana Ericson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does the thought of forgiveness make you cringe? Do you hate the idea of forgiving someone who has wronged you, believing its a waste of time? Then THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU! If youre like most people, you probably have a certain person you blame for why youre not happier, why you arent wealthier, or any other condemnation that keeps you stuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how an ancient method of letting go can help you move mountains and take your power back in just 7 days. Forgiveness Coach, Juliana Ericson, will show you step-by-step how to regain your peace of mind and heart. She shares numerous examples from hundreds of her clients who began with a story of disgust or rage, then successfully turned them into peaceful and empowering situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book uniquely addresses blocks to happiness that exist in our conscious memories, and those hidden in our subconscious minds that may have originated early in our childhood, at birth or even in the womb. Ericson explains this deep core programming, and helps us connect the dots from what we experienced at our beginnings to limiting beliefs we may now experience as adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab this wondrous and sacred opportunity to begin anew. You dont have to do it alone; youll have Julianas help this time. And it only has to take seven days. Imagine what your life could be if free from resentment and anger. Just imagine the possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;" />
