  <title>A Time to Dance - Milli Laughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In August of 1983, Mark Laughlin, a young graduate student, was involved in a seemingly minor bicycling accident. Thirty-three hours later, he was lying in bed, his body stiff from convulsions and blood gushing from his mouth.
Its seldom that we are allowed to watch a crisis unfold in which the key players let God be God. Many people believe that God is in control and can do what he pleases, that is, until we are gripped by an overwhelming experience. When a trauma of this magnitude strikes, we often question and criticize God. In Laughlins story, A Time to Dance, we see how belief in Gods sovereignty affects the individual, the family, the pastor, and the church. We see faith stretched to its breaking point but never lost or broken. In spite of the hopelessness of Marks situation, the Laughlin family clings to their faith  a faith also willing to release a beloved son and brother, if that is indeed part of Gods plan.
A Time to Dance is a powerful illustration of the unwavering devotion displayed by the Laughlins. It takes you behind the scenes of a tragedy and allows you to share in the miraculous experiences of a family that trusted God." />
