      <meta name="description" content="Are you still pushing good men away because of your own insecurities? Do you still want it all after the first date and give it all on the second date? Are you consistently waiting for him to call you back or spend time with you? If so, its time to be cleansed. Like cleansing yourself from toxic foods, its time to begin doing the same with toxic relationships. &lt;p&gt;
In His Ingredient Label: A Womans Guide to Recognizing a Junk Food Man, author J.M. Tardy shows you how men are like foods to which you can become addicted if you dont control yourself. It helps you to recognize how your own decision-making can be the first step to a healthier relationship, and it demonstrates how to recognize the true character of a man by investigating what he is made of.&lt;p&gt;
Relating true stories from other women and from her personal experience, Tardy explains that people have ingredients like food, and women need to choose men based on the quality of those ingredients. Through His Ingredient Label, Tardy encourages women to seek and maintain healthy relationships." />
