  <title>Stepping Stones - Bryan Britton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The educational system in South Africa has failed the young learners of this new nation, says author Bryan Britton who has contributed this work as a very small step in the giant leap necessary to rehabilitate our highly susceptible youth and help them make sound and moral judgements. There has been little concern for the aspirations of the young people of South Africa. The benefits of learning, character building, moral education and religion were lost in the turmoil of the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in a rudderless, sometimes murderous element, pervading South African society. The Rainbow Nation is today the crime mecca of the world, and the haves now have more and the have nots, appallingly less. Can we put an end to this moral decay? Perhaps adopting sound, non-sexist, non-racial and evergreen wisdom from the past can be used to commence regenerating the shredded moral fibre of this country? To aid youngsters in their search for ethics, the author has gathered a selection of pertinent wisdom from the past. Perhaps young people in South Africa will see in these excerpts, building blocks with which to construct a viable morality for their young lives and hence for the country they are destined to inherit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
