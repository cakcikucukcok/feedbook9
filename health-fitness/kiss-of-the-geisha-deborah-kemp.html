  <title>Kiss of the Geisha - Deborah Kemp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Kiss of the Geisha&lt;/I&gt;, Page and Kenji Tanaka are enjoying a passionate life together following their whirlwind courtship, when they are drawn into a mysterious murder.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Page is teaching part time at Kyoto University when a fellow professor dies of poisoning from the deadly puffer fish, fugu.  Several other men have died in the same way, and Page begins to suspect that the professor was murdered because of his research into Japanese war crimes involving the dead men. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Page is tutoring a young Japanese girl who is training to become a geisha. This young girl becomes involved in the killings when she overhears a conversation between her geisha mother and her geisha mothers patron.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Page and Kenji travel to Europe, but when they return, the threat of danger still hangs over them.  Page realizes that having all the money she could ever need doesnt make her immune to that danger. She knows that someone wants to silence her, possibly forever, and she must rely on Kenji and her friends to save her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Kyoto, Tokyo, Kamakura, and Osaka are the settings for &lt;I&gt;Kiss of the Geisha&lt;/I&gt; where every day life in Japan presents some interesting challenges for Page.  Some familiar characters from &lt;I&gt;Kyoto Connection&lt;/I&gt; return in this second book in the continuing series.  &lt;/P&gt;" />
