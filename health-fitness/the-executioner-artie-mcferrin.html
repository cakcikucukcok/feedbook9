  <title>The Executioner - Artie McFerrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Executioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Artie McFerrin has taken personal leadership development to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Cummins, director, Corps of Cadets Leadership Excellence Program at Texas A&amp;M University &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to learn from someone who has proven his exceptional entrepreneurship and leadership has made me more comfortable in making executive decisions. It is a must-read for any CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Gaudet, owner and CEO of Gaudet Solutions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very powerful self-help book that outlines exactly how to become successful at your own dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Royston, mission evaluation room engineer, NASA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating and extremely valuable trip inside the mindand the success-building habitsof one of Americas most successful entrepreneurs. . . . Like a positive mental attitude coupled with a creative plan, Arties book will change lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Moore, partner, Enoch Kever Law Firm; former general counsel, TXU Energy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his earthy and understandable style built from his own learning and experience, Artie has captured in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Executioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a great roadmap for being successful in business whether it is as the CEO of a start-up company, or as the leader of an established operation looking to grow and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis J. Seith, CEO INEOS Olefins and Polymers USA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Executioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a comprehensive modernized update of the 1937 success classic, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill with the more effective nonconventional thinking, execution, and business practices since developed. Hill was unsurpassed in getting right the improved thinking, goals, and action needed for obtaining excellence. However, these near -invisible intangible success principles have remained very elusive to implement. The best business practices in most of the best books available today are also very elusive for most to implement well but for a different reason. These great practices identified dont work until you develop your thinking, habits, and ability to execute them like Hill promoted. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Executioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a guide to excellence in developing your thinking, goals, positive mental attitude, courage, will-power, people, business, and mastery, and over-coming self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
