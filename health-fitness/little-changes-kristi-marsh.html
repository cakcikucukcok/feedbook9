  <title>Little Changes - Kristi Marsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little Changes is a succulent swirling lollipop of lessons about the products we smother on our skin, foods we devour, and surroundings in which we immerse ourselves. A gut-wrenching roller coaster of emotions, her adventure involves a Western Grebe, farm stand spinach, a meaty love story, a rock in Wyoming, and some pioneers&amp;mdash;which eventually captured national attention.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a cup of humor, a smidgeon of sarcasm, and a wallop of mainstream motherhood, Little Changes enlightens readers about the simmering, swelling, epic transformation of our generation; becoming self-advocates for their own environmental health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer at age thirty-six and with three young children at home, Kristi started on a quest to eliminate harmful chemicals from her life and environment. Now a proponent for environmental health, Kristi&amp;#39;s passion is to share her knowledge and journey with others. &amp;quot;So many people are reluctant to make changes in their lives because they think it&amp;#39;s going to be expensive or time consuming. But making little changes over time in the products we smother on our skin, foods we devour, and surroundings we immerse ourselves, doesn&amp;#39;t have to be difficult.&amp;quot; Kristi&amp;#39;s dynamic message empowers her audiences to choose wiser products with kinder, simpler ingredients, giving themselves the gift of the best life possible." />
