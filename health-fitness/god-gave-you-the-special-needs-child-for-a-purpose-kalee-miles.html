  <title>God Gave You the Special Needs Child for a Purpose - Kalee Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although Brave was a surprise four-week premature baby, he weighed way more than many of the full-time babies. Thankfully, he was in great shape and was able to come home like a normal baby. He was a happy boy hitting time lines until he hit age one. At that point, the Pediatrician referred Brave to a program where Kalee finally realized how behind he was in many parts of the body. From that time until he went to kindergarten, she would soon learn so many different procedures and different types of doctors, specialists, therapists, tests, and diagnoses; many times the hard way.  Insurance wouldnt help her, they would just put off paying for a procedure. Helping get Brave the most assistance and diagnosis was only the beginning. Kalee would have some of the same procedures to keep track of her own serious medical issues and her other son, Timbers, diagnosis. Having God lead her each day and provide her with hope, love, and grace truly kept her going. Without the Lord at her side, she may not have seen that God selected her to have two special needs kids. Its a blessing she doesnt deserve and just prays that God shows her each day what she needs to be doing for Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
