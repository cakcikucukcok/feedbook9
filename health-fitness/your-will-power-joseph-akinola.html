  <title>Your Will Power - Joseph Akinola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will power is one of the strongest virtues a man can possess. And no will power can be effective without the implementation of immediate actions. Taking action is very necessary just as having intention is. Success comes from within, if you can succeed on the inside; you can succeed in any area of your life. The quest for success starts from within which is your mind.
Plans dont count much, but action does. All plans, projects goals, dreams and visions remain on hold without applying action immediately. What happens is that the drive and motivation to work on it fades out or dies when action is not carried out immediately.
Have you ever at a point in your life had intentions to do things which now made you set goals towards it or you have even set goals to accomplish a particular task and all of a sudden, you find out that the drive and passion to push that goal or to execute that goal to its fulfillment level disappears or diminishes and made that task become an item on your activity list? Then, this book is for you. Everything you need to fulfill life and achieve destiny is inside of you. It begins with your Will Power." />
