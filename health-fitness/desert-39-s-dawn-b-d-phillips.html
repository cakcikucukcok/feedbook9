  <title>Desert&#39;s Dawn - B.D. Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;   Fifteen years ago, the residents of a smallArizonatown just north of the Mexican border began to be affected by the criminal acts of a small band of survivalists, encamped approximately 50 miles south of town.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;   Led by by a former U.S. Army officer, named Tom Roberts, dishonorably discharged, near the end of the Vietnam war, this band of survivalists, silently conducted criminal acts, such as drug running, extortion, and white slavery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;For years Roberts kept just ahead of the law in his dealings, until a beautiful district attorney by the name of Jennifer Danials manages to dig up the evidence that would finally put Roberts away. One week later, her dead body was discovered floating in a nearby river.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;   Now, ten years later, the woman&#39;&#39;s seventeen- year old daughter, Sheila, leads a very extraordinary life. Raised alone, by her wheelchair-bound older brother, Andrew, since she was just seven, she has excelled from a distraught young girl to a black-belt in the martial arts and an almost genius academically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Sheila Danials, her friends, and family know nothing of Roberts plans as they go about their everyday lives. But every day that brings Tom Roberts closer to his retirement...brings the Danials family closer to a showdown with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
