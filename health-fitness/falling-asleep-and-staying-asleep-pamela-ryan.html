  <title>Falling Asleep and Staying Asleep - Pamela Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For some of us, falling asleep and staying asleep takes a creative process. This book offers new insights into why some of us may struggle with a natural bodily function, like sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book you will find how your physical comfort is one reason you are losing sleep. But thats not the only reason we dont fall asleep and stay asleep. This book will reveal that the temperature, lighting, and electronic energy in the room will affect your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive learned that blocked energy in the body, mind, or spirit will cause sleepless nights. I show how dieting, loneliness, sexual energy and emotional pain will keep you awake. I still prepare myself at night for the ritual of falling asleep and staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our body is run on a schedule, call our circadian rhythm. When your biological clock is out of sync, I show you ways to get back on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to learn how to fall sleep without the use of sleep aids. I was determined, so I tried many so-called techniques, including everything, from hypnotherapy to hot toddies, to fall asleep. After years of wrestling with myself, I began using certain practices that developed into the form of rituals I still use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the rituals made it easier to release blocked energy and to cleanse my soul from negative emotions I picked up through the day. What I share in the book are the many solutions that worked for me. By using the visualization exercises found in the book, these energy centers will release the blocked energy so that you can finally sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say I sleep well now. Ive learned how to use energy properly; clear blockages, exercise regularly, forgive myself and others more quickly, and use visualization rituals to natural remedies to help me fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;" />
