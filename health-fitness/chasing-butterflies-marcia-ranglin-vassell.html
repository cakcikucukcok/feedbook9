  <title>Chasing Butterflies - Marcia Ranglin - Vassell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chasing Butterflies is a collection of quotations, poems and the simple joys of life. It is about my life and the way I choose to live it for my God, my family and the people I come in contact with every day. The poems and quotations in this book are original and come from my over thirty five years of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write this amazing book for two reasons. Firstly, my Mom who is an avid reader encouraged me to write a book that she could actually sit on her porch to read and enjoy. Secondly, I wanted to share the richness of my life experiences with not just my inner circle but the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Jamaica, almost every conversation was peppered or sweetened with Bible verses or quotations. My grandparents, especially my grandmother had a word for every situation or problem. My love and appreciation for the spoken word increased as I got older. I soon realized how potent words are. So, I do not use words frivolously. I think about what I say carefully. As my late grandmother would say weigh your words before you speak, because words carry weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this book comes from my love of butterflies. As a young girl, I would spend numerous hours chasing butterflies. I even remember being struck by a passing car as my friend Marcia S. and I chased butterflies on our way home from school. Luckily I was not badly hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing Butterflies will not disappoint its readers. It draws from my experiences as a mother, wife, employee, sister, friend and most importantly a child of God. This book will inspire readers everywhere. It will provide support, affirmation, guidance, consolation and laughter. Chasing Butterflies is a book for all season. It is the work of my heart and a timeless treasure that everyone should have in their collection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
