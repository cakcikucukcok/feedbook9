  <title>54 Simple Truths - Michael Wash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book gives plenty of information and ideas but more than that, it gives the reader hope. The hope that can lead to an honest reappraisal of our own experiences, and the confidence to be the person we most want to be. Who would benefit from this book? Anyone who wants to make the most of their life, and learn about living! 
Dr Mary Connor Author and Consultant in Coaching and Counselling. 
This is a book that doesnt pull its punches, which speaks honestly and directly about the challenges of life, offering advice from the authors own experience and from the worlds wisdom. Dip into when you need to face up to harsh realities, when you need to hear a wise and friendly voice, when you need reminding that you are valuable and worthwhile. 
Susan Quilliam  Author of 21 books on relationship psychology, 
National Press journalist and broadcaster. 
Although many of us can ask friends for advice, most of those friends will be unwilling to give advice which may be seen as insensitive or uncaring but which may be very much required. This book does what a really good friend should be able to do, that is give honest advice in a world that is not always fair or kind. 
Dr Niamh Leonard Consultant Histopathologist, St James Hospital, Dublin 
Michael Wash gives simple, practical and powerful lessons on the importance of choice and responsibility. His book guides you through stressful times with practical suggestions and reveals ways to make your actions more peaceful and caring. 
54 Simple Truths could save you a lot of grief. It may even save your life.
