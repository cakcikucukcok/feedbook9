  <title>Guillain-Barre Syndrome - Brian S. Langton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about three people from different walks of life, each of
whom experienced a life-changing episode of Guillain-Barr Syndrome.
Three dramatic stories in one.
&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, a story of the Author&#39;s remarkable almost complete recovery
following his encounter with the syndrome. It is a frank and personal
account of his struggle to regain much of what he had lost in bodily
function during one year of hospitalisation. It should provide
inspiration and possibly answer so many questions typically asked by
others afflicted with this syndrome.
&lt;p&gt;
Secondly, case studies written by two co-author contributors, one a
Calgary Veterinarian and mother of two, the other a retired Vancouver
resident who was struck with Guillain-Barr Syndrome whilst shopping for
a boat in England.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;There is no single answer to the question as to how life may change
after recovery from this disorder. Each case appears to be unique. That
is why I have chosen to include, not just a record of my partial
recovery, but also the recovery record of two additional people, each
different from one another&#39;s and each certainly different from mine
(Author&#39;s Preface)&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;We eventually identified a boatonly three feet short of what we had
wanted that was within our budget. 
&lt;p&gt;
At this point Heather&#39;s brother,
who lived nearby, said he would like a share in the boat, to which we
agreed. During this discussion in his house I had to ask him to refrain
from smoking, as my throat was quite sore. I was feeling rather run down
and often felt cold. About the same time on a Saturday, I felt a
tingling in the finger tips of my left hand and found they were a bit
swollen. I mentioned it to Heather, but it did not seem serious. It was,
however, the first sign that I had contracted GBS. If only I had known,
the treatment might have been started earlier! (Patrick Hill)&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Probably the worst face of Guillain-Barr Syndrome is the effect it
has on loved ones. Severe, or not, chronic or not, it matters little to
the supporting family at the bedside of a patient. Fear, puzzlement, and
apprehension are all experienced by the loved ones. Reading the case
histories of Sarah and Patrick, one learns how their spouses also
suffered many frightening experiences, but in spite of all that, they
remained  obviously without second thought, hesitation or doubt. True
to their marriage vows, they provided so much love, care and support.
That was the shared experience among the three of us (Author:
Epilogue).&quot;" />
