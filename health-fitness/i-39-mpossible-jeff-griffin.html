  <title>I&#39;mpossible - Jeff Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The suns rays filtered in from the partially opened shades of the plane. They lit up the world in front of me and warmed my soul, knowing I was almost to my destination. The beautiful golden light replaced the grey and hazy cobwebs from my eyes, revealing the most spectacular scene I had ever seen in my entire life. I looked out the small seven-inch window and witnessed something that Ill never forget! I beheld something in this magnificent world that the majority of people never get to see. I was looking out at Mount Everest, the worlds highest peak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at the tail end of a three-flight journey with two layovers in between, nearly logging twenty-four hours of flight time. I hadnt gotten any real sleep in the last thirty-six hours. My bloodshot eyes were heavy, my mind was slow and sluggish, and my body was even slower in response. How did I get here? I thought to myself.  Am I d-r-e-a-m-i-n-g?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lao and Confucius once said, A journey of one-thousand miles begins with one step. My story is about inspiring you to take your own journey one step at a time. Its about dreaming and accomplishing the impossible. Its not only about aiming for the sky and reaching for the stars but enjoying the journey along the way.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Begin your personal journey today, press forward to the top, and dont you ever stop. As you move toward your dreams, there will be obstacles and setbacks along the way; dont be afraid. You can get to the top of your world by following the signs and guide posts within these pages. You can do it with others! You can do it with me! We can do it together, one step at a time!&lt;/p&gt;
