  <title>The Heated Diamond - Jae L. Mackall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord God is our help in time of all our troubles and many sorrows. (Psalm 46:1) God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. During our distress we have been told to pray and believe God forever thing. But, somehow it has become so hard to do that very thing. The word of God has been introduce and presented so many times to the unbelievers as well as to the believers of God. Yet, we live each day on uncertainties and doubt. Not being aware that doubt brings a spirit of fear and stress. 
  God wants us to get to a place of security. We can rest in Him the bible teaches us that there is safety, peace, joy, and longsuffering in Him. As a child we are taught to respect our elders and become responsible when we become an adult. 
  As Christian we are taught not to become arrogant and prideful, but we have come to know the pressures of this life that tends to weigh us down. We are press and force into making decision that will cause us to weaver in our faith such as heartaches, sorrows, guilt, and heavy burdens. Beloved this book is about why we are compared to the diamond. The diamond is so valuable, yes forgetting that it was just a mere piece of coal. (worthless). We are also valuable after being formed by dirt. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul (Genesis 2-7). 
 We are shaped and mold, in order to develop our character into what God wants us to be. 
The bible teaches us that we are under Gods mercy and grace. I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is  good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.(Roman 12: 1-2). 
Yes, Gods perfect will not ours. Remember God perfect will, it will sustain us from the pressures of this old world. It will strengthen us to hold on to what God says." />
