  <title>Digging for Goals - Mary Barnes Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful book/workbook in one!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mary does a great job of laying a foundation for what is needed in mind, body and spirit to develop your desires/dreams/intentions. And if that is not enough, Mary lays out 7 different approaches for developing those intentions into reality. I found &lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt; to be an effective process-oriented book to get you from where you are to where you want to be! Knowing Mary as a professional coach, her wholistic flavor definitely shines through the process of &lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt;! I would highly recommend &lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt; if you are serious about moving toward your dreams in life. 
 Shawn Preuss, PCC Professional Life Coach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that effective goal setting can make a tremendous positive difference in ones life, both personally and professionally. The problem for many people is that they simply dont know how to go about the process. In &lt;i&gt;Digging For Goals&lt;/i&gt;, Mary lays out a clear and easy to follow path to effective goal setting. The book gets right to the heart of the matter and does so in a compelling and entertaining fashion. Having worked with Mary for many years, I have seen first-hand how she has helped scores of people lead more accomplished lives by setting and working towards their goals. This book can do the same for anyone looking to get more out of their lives.
 William Aberman, Vice President Kesslers Diamonds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt; is a must read for those who have never set goals for themselves as well as those who are sophisticated goal setters. The easy-to-follow guide clearly draws out a game plan that allows people to bring themselves to a higher level in all areas of their lives.

&lt;p&gt;Every bookstore has an enormous self-help section devoted to advising to lose weight, to be better parents, or to learn a new skill. Theres no shortage of advice on WHAT to do. Yet the knowing-doing gap remains. The books gather dust, and the readers have the same unachieved goals they did when they purchased the self-help book.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Mary Barnes Johnson has developed a workbook, &lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt;, spectacularly avoiding telling the reader WHAT to do. Instead, it tells us HOW to achieve whatever goal or goals we set. Its not preachy. Its not long-winded. It takes us step-by-step through the process, and gives real-life examples of overcoming obstacles any true change is sure to face.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Regardless what our goal is, &lt;i&gt;Digging for Goals&lt;/i&gt; can provide inspiration and methods to achieve it. Thanks, Mary, for helping us succeed.
