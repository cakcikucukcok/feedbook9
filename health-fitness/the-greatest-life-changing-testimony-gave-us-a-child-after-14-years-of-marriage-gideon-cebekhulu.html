  <title>The Greatest Life Changing Testimony Gave Us a Child After 14 Years of Marriage - Gideon Cebekhulu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The main purpose of this book is to share the story of how God blessed us with a child after fourteen years of marriage. It will also try and share with the reader the journey and experiences that we had to go through in terms of traditional healing, medical doctors, as well as the prophetic work of God the Holy Spirit.
The book is not intended to claim that only one part of the healing process was good, but it is also recognizing the fact that it is God who gives us his mercy and grace, and therefore, our journey together with healing process becomes different.
In fact, the book will emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach for getting a child should you have similar challenge like we had.
The importance of changing ones position both spiritually and physically will be mentioned quite a lot in this book so that we can discuss why God created us in his image and after his likeness. This will help to discover our purpose in life." />
