  <title>The Broken American Male - Shmuley Boteach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do American husbands come home from work too exhausted to interact with their families? When did a healthy quest for prosperity become a twisted game no one can win? How did BlackBerries and internet porn become more interesting to men than their flesh-and-blood spouses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shmuley Boteach has made a great study of how families live today--both in his work as a rabbi privately and as host of TLC&#39;s &quot;Shalom in the Home&quot;.  He&#39;s discovered a disturbing common thread in the families he meets: men responding to the pressure of competition in their work lives by turning away from their loved ones.  In a world that judges men by the size of their paychecks and the wattage of their fame, it&#39;s all too easy to lose sight of what is truly valuable in life.  Men who consider themselves failures and don&#39;t love themselves turn into stressed-out dads, distracted husbands and miserable human beings. For these men, alcohol, the internet and sporting events serve as numbing stand-ins for read life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In THE BROKEN AMERICAN MALE, Boteach doesn&#39;t just outline the problems facing marriages and nuclear families.  He also offers practical, inspiring solutions, showing how wives can reach out to their husbands, helping them become heroes again to their own families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
