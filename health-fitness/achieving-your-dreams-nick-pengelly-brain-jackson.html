  <title>Achieving Your Dreams - Nick Pengelly, Brain Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An inspiring and practical guide for people wishing to achieve their dreams. Whether you wish to lose weight, start a business or run a marathon, this book will help you achieve your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian and Nick have drawn on their passion and experience to co-write a book that inspires readers to achieve their dreams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The book features inspiring stories and practical information to help the reader take the first step and continue the path to achieving their dreams and reaching their full potential. It can be aligned to any dream that someone may have - whether it be to lose weight, change career or learn a different language.&lt;br /&gt;
They were inspired to write the book having both achieved their own dreams with Brian wanting to summit an unclimbed mountain since he was 8yrs old, a dream he finally achieved in 2013, successfully summiting a previously unclimbed peak called &amp;lsquo;Chhubohe&amp;rsquo; in the Himalayas. He has since gone on to lead others on expeditions to climb other unclimbed mountains in Nepal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Brian says &amp;lsquo;I have a real passion for the personal development of others and helping them to achieve their dreams has always been an integral part of everything I do. I have always wanted to create a practical guide that will inspire others to take those first steps to achieving their own dreams, whether it be climbing mountains, getting fit or starting a new venture.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Nick also achieved his dream to help others, set up his own business and now encourages others to find out what they are made for and to live life to the full.&lt;/p&gt;" />
