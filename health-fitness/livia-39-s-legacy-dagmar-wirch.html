  <title>Livia&#39;s Legacy - Dagmar Wirch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Livias Legacy, a true story, reads like a thrilling novel. It tells about a harrowing flight from Russian armies, an illicit border crossing into West Germany, a dangerous ocean voyage to Canada, and adapting to life in a new land. Several times in her life, Livia lost her home and most of her possessions and had to start all over. My mother, Livia, lost her first love, struggled in an unhappy marriage, and eventually, had to become the breadwinner of her family. During this time, she suffered from angina and, later, Parkinsons disease. How she overcame tremendous problems will be an inspiration to all who read this book. Much of the information came from a memoir handwritten in German by Lydia, Livias sister. I knew that this story was worth passing on and added details from my own memory and imagination." />
