  <title>How to Think Like a Millionaire - Marc Fisher, Marc Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this inspiring book, millionaires Mark Fisher and Marc Allen demonstrate that success is available to all who want it and who put their desires into action. Rather than waiting for a stroke of fate to change your situation, you can immediately begin to work with your most powerful ally — your own subconscious mind. When you do this by applying the specific and easy-to-learn principles presented here, success soon follows.
By imprinting a personal success formula on your subconscious, you can program yourself to succeed, instead of failing by default or, even worse, never trying in the first place. In these pages, you’ll learn how to weed out limiting beliefs and to plant positive new ones. You’ll also discover other components of the millionaire mind-set, including why it’s better to make quick decisions based on intuition and to stick to them rather than to vacillate, the importance of balancing persistence with flexibility, and how to effectively implement step-by-step strategies to move toward a chosen goal.
Clear, simple, and wise, How to Think Like a Millionaire offers the tools you need to live the life of your dreams." />
