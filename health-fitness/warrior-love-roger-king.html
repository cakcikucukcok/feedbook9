  <title>Warrior Love - Roger King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Roger King asks a question we may find truly challenging: Could humanity make a huge shift in consciousness and realize we are more naturally polyamorous than monogamous?
In this narrative, a vulnerable story emerges when Roger and his partner separate. With heartfelt anger, love, and wisdom, Roger unveils his inner secret, admitting he is a polyamorous manhe loves more than one woman. 
Roger writes with disarming honesty and offers insights that can help men and women become open and receptive to love without fear. The message is simple, not always easy: You can change your thoughts with radical honesty and change your life.
Men: Are you willing to love yourself and make the world safer for us to love each other? Women: Can you trust men with your love? Can we learn to replace jealousy of all types with unconditional love?
Can war and terrorism stop and all types of slavery cease? Salvation lies in all of us waking up and learning to love who we truly are. 
If a male version of Louise Hay exists, Roger is it!
Isabelle P. Walker-Lefebvre, 
Heal Your Life facilitator
Roger walks his talk, and its so easy to be real around him.
Sam Hardy, business owner
Who would be fearful, critical, or jealous of you, if you changed by loving yourself and then shining that love and the powerful miracle within you to create a whole new way of being and living?" />
