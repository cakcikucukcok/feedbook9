  <title>Hypothesis - Teresa Marie Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is how my personal healing experiment became an opportunity to educate women about HPV treatment options and their power of choice-making. I share my story of regression and guide the reader through a decision-making process. My intention is to help women feel empowered to take their health into their own hands and to encourage them to continue experiencing joy every day, even in the wake of an unsettling diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how my personal healing experiment became an opportunity to educate women about HPV treatment options and their power of choice-making. I share my story of regression and guide the reader through a decision-making process. My intention is to help women feel empowered to take their health into their own hands and to encourage them to continue experiencing joy every day, even in the wake of an unsettling diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can heal myself from stage-zero cervical cancer, at age 50, while keeping my cervix, my heart and my mind intact. Leveraging methods I learned throughout my career in software engineering, I designed my own healing experiment to prove out this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Process - Infinite Possibilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, we walk together through my own decision-making process that is based on the scientific method and augmented with the power heart and mind. This can be a guide to any problem-solving really: but for our purpose now in addressing HPV and cervical dysplasia, this process is used to define your own personal experiment in self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Experiment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1: The treatment plan I designed for myself required a commitment to incorporate alternative medicine into my everyday life. I approached this as my own personal experiment in self-healing, and measured my progress with standard cervical cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procedures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Naturopathic medicine: anti-inflammatory diet, supplements and natural topical treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yoga practice: breathe (pranayama), movement (asana), meditation, and mantra.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thank you: create a vision of gratitude transforming all expected results into tangible actions of being grateful.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Measurement: Cancer progression screenings according to the ACOG schedule of Well-Women ages 40-65.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Own Healing Experiment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not alone in this! Every year in America there are 250,000 to a million women who receive a cervical dysplasia diagnosis.&amp;nbsp; In Part 2 of the book, we walk through the decision-making process that facilitates the development of your own healing experiment. The foundation is to apply self-observation to&amp;nbsp;understand your own Joy and make actionable decisions. Each step of the way I provide plenty of resources: my story as an example, references&amp;nbsp;including materials lists, space for journaling your findings and thoughts and words of experience from women just like you who have faced the same choices.&lt;/p&gt;" />
