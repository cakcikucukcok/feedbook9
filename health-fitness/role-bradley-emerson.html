  <title>Role - Bradley Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We sometimes choose. Sometimes, we are compelled to take many roles in our personal and work life. As the saying goes, we are wearing many hats. The challenge is that some of these hats are worn at the same time, and there are many who are waiting to see how best you fit the hat. Particularly, in your work life, you are driven to fit best the many hats in different roles you may take up. How it works outs is that the hat will best fit to how you perform the role as you perceive it to be or, more so, how it is perceived by others.
Role is a wake-up call to executives and managers to realize that although education and experience may qualify for the role, performing and sustaining the performance in the role will largely depend on what external factors influence the role and what internal drivers sustain the performance. 
It is the metaphor of a bubble. A bubble, no matter how deep it is formed in the sea, will find its way up only as long as it remains a bubble. For a bubble to sustain its form, a bubble needs to withstand the oceanic pressure with the little air within. The Role elaborates how you can remain a bubble in the ocean of work. When you have inner strength to balance the external pressure, you, like a bubble, will keep going up!" />
