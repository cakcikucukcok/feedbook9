  <title>Above the Chatter, Our Words Matter - Bruce Pulver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bruce Pulver was inspired to create this book of words of inspiration for others in order to change lives. He is passionate about self improvement and is committed to learning and investing in people. Above the Chatter, Our Words Matter is the culmination of a 400 consecutive days of writing short personal messages to help others make each day successful regardless of their situation.
Have you ever faced a significant challenge? Bruce has used these messages personally to improve his outlook, perspective, attitude and philosophy in life. Through this growth and transformation, Bruce has seen his results reach increasing greater levels. He knows first-hand how words, thoughts and how we speak to ourselves ultimately drive intentions, actions, dedication and outcomes. As a healthcare sales professional, Bruce has earned several prestigious sales awards including “Rookie of the Year” and “Sales Executive of the Year,” which he attained after his second year selling. Last year, Bruce was again awarded &quot;Sales Executive of the Year; he closed 22 opportunities valued at $16M in revenue." />
