  <title>Unlock Potential - with Love - Ken G Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How much more could you achieve with your life? This remarkable book provides the key to unlocking the potential you already have. There are no fancy formulae - indeed the great strength herein is its simplicity indicating the power of love to open the way that is before us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that when love dominates our actions we can surpass what is the norm. In reading this book, we see how. The unlocking of what we have within is inevitable, because it is there. The ability to love what we do, and love what we are, brings out a new love of life. It guides us to do things differently, otherwise we remain as we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your beliefs, the power of love is known and proved. While written with a love for the Bible, it reaches out and embraces everyone, whatever their leaning. It is not confined to Christianity, for love is universal. Nor is this about positive thinking / visualisation. It is about the &lt;strong&gt;reality&lt;/strong&gt; of your unique potential, fulfilled by the love in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
