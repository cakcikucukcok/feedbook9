  <title>The Poetic Rhythms of Life - Quincey Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Poetic Rhythms of Life is inspired by real-life events. Ive been writing for over thirty years. Ive written a number of things over my lifetime. Most of the materials Ive written are inspirational in nature to uplift friends and loved ones who needed that certain something to give them hope. Many of my inspirational poems and letters still remain in the possession of those individuals, and to this very day, they remind me of how it got them through hard times. Due to the awesome reviews of my peers, I finally decided to publish all of those poems that I spent much time on over the years. Im inspired to inspire anyone who needs an encouraging word. I enjoy bringing a smile to someones face; Im also encouraged when I encourage others. I like to let others know in any case, situation, or problem that theres hope: Jesus is alive. He makes any situation better. Id like to thank all my true friends, my family, my celebrators, and my haters-you helped me by pushing me into my divine destiny, to give birth to my first of many books, The Poetic Rhythms of Life. Special thanks to my children and husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
