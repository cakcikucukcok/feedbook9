  <title>First Aid on the Farm - Alfred Lee Anduze, Ferdinand Rivera Villalba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First aid is the emergency medical care given before professional care is available.  In most cases, it is sufficient for complete recovery. In some cases, it is essential for stabilization while complete medical care is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the farm?  It is often located in a remote area, away from adequate medical facilities, with high exposure to sun, insects, reptiles, poisonous plants, wind, dust, and variable temperatures.  Farming activities are highly susceptible to accidents due to use of tools, machinery, animal care, difficult terrain, and use of cleaning materials that may lead to a higher incidence of infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to provide a quick, easy guide to the recognition and treatment of basic emergency conditions that may be encountered on a farm in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the conventional treatments and medications, this book suggests natural treatments using products that may be present in the farm and in surrounding forests.&lt;/p&gt;" />
