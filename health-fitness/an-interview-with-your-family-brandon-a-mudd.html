      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How well do you know your family? Do you know what your parents were passionate about when they were younger? What life lessons did your grandparents learn? Have you heard stories at a family members funeral you wish youd known while he or she was alive?

The result of the hundreds of hours spent interviewing grandparents, parents, siblings, and business clients, &lt;i&gt;An Interview with Your Family&lt;/i&gt;, makes asking questions simple. With step-by-step directions included, he covers both formal and informal interviewing, offering advice on the types of questions to ask, methods for recording the information, and tactics for piecing it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mudd believes everyone has a story worth telling, that laughter and love are the cure to all of lifes issues and challenges, and that sharing these amazing tales is the greatest gift of all. The guidance offered in &lt;i&gt;An Interview with Your Family&lt;/i&gt; can help you cultivate a deeper understanding of your parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, and significant others. It may also help you spend more quality time with your family members and close friends, and learn about their biggest life lessons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
