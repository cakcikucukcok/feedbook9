  <title>More Powerful Than We Think - Ingabire Paola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gender violence is an issue that we all experience or experienced in one way or another in any society you may live in regardless of your standards of living. You understand this very well if you are female. 
But is it really true that women are incapable? Is it true that we are mentally weak? Is it true that education is not made for us, especially science and technology? Are we going to sit back and watch sexual harassment on women, especially at work, become a culture that cannot be changed? 
We have been taught to degrade ourselves and praise our demeaning. We have been given names such as bitches, horses, hoes. And we kindly accept them. This should be a burden and responsibility to every woman around the world to take and fix. 
All women face sexual harassment in a certain way. This book, More Powerful Than We Think, is about to reveal the truth about this issue. This book is going to help women travel into their inner being and shut down all their fears. Our mind can do anything, women. We just have to push ourselves a little bit hard from our comfort zone and make the fight our own by mutual support, appreciating one another, loving one another, and uplifting one another. Here are testimonies that will strengthen you to do better and prove that everything can be possible." />
