  <title>In Love Under New Management - Gwendolyn Ann Cook, Pastor Jonathan W. Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As you read In Love Under New Management, you will meet a woman who dares to live out her divine purpose. After enduring sixteen years with an issue of blood and a number of other medical issues, she was led to depend on her faith, which ultimately caused her to obtain her healing. Through her own transparency, Gwen will also help you discover that your beginning does not necessarily determine your end. Gwen grew up in a loving military family, being the youngest of five siblings of four girls and one boy. During her adolescence years, she suffered with an extremely low self-image of herself while struggling with her weight. After several years of dieting with no success, she redirected her focus on how she could assist others to live out their God-given assignment, and in giving of herself to others, she was able to witness some of her own successes. From the beginning to the end, In Love Under New Management will keep you on the edge of your seat." />
