  <title>Happiness 101 (previously published as When Likes Arent Enough) - Tim Bono</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you as authentically happy as your social media profiles make it seem?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When a group of researchers asked young adults around the globe what  their number one priority was in life, the top answer was &quot;happiness.&quot; Not success, fame, money, looks, or love...but happiness. For a rising  generation of young adults raised as digital natives in a fast-paced,  ultra-connected world, authentic happiness still seems just out of  reach. While social media often shows well-lit selfies and flawless digital personas, today&#39;s 16- to 25-year-olds are struggling to find real  meaning, connection, and satisfaction right alongside their  overburdened parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;An Introduction to Happiness&lt;/i&gt; tackles the  ever-popular subject of happiness and well-being, but  reframes it for a younger reader struggling with Instagram envy and  high-stakes testing, college rejections and helicopter parents. Professor of positive psychology Dr. Tim Bono distills his most popular  college course on the science of happiness  into creative, often counterintuitive, strategies for young adults to  lead happier, more fulfilling lives. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Filled with exciting  research, practical exercises, honest advice, and quotes and stories  from young adults themselves, &lt;i&gt;An Introduction to Happiness&lt;/i&gt; is a master class  for a generation looking for science-based, real world ways to feel  just a little bit happ&lt;i&gt;ier&lt;/i&gt; every day." />
