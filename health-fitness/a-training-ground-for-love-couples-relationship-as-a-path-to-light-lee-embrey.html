  <title>A Training Ground for Love: Couples Relationship as a Path to Light - Lee Embrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Training Ground for Love: Couples Relationship as a Path to Light&lt;/em&gt; is part philosophic treatise, part spiritual manual, part relational guide, and part introduction to the voyage of the soul. This book is a synthesis of esoteric experiences from Buddhism, Hinduism, Shamanism, Taoism, Sufism, and Tantra. It is grounded in strong psychological, relational, archetypal experiences of the individual and the couple.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, Dr. Lee Embrey presents a picture of relationships as significant for spiritual practice, the meaning of life, and a crucial part of the individuation process. He uncovers new meaning in meditation practice, the Primordial Mind, and the archetypes in an effort to free the individual from cultural conditioning (Eastern or Western), thereby unfettering the mind to allow for peace beyond dualistic thinking. The discussions in this book should be of vital importance, as it is not just about the meaning of one&amp;rsquo;s own life and relationships but the fulfillment of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book starts by examining how we are conditioned by mass media to assume that life is as it is presented to us, which leaves us with the challenge of winning back our own mind. The author evaluates spiritual conditioning, scrutinizes the underlying purpose of life, investigates meditation methods, probes the occurrence of light in near-death experiences, and questions whether that experience of light might not be the ultimate aim of meditation. The way of the couple thus becomes a spiritual discipline that guides us through life, as emotional development is spiritual actualization. The book insists that emotional maturation is the methodology of reincarnation, and includes notes on the process of dying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Training Ground for Love &lt;/em&gt;concludes that the origination of religions, spiritual philosophies, and indeed the direction of all life is based in pure consciousness and the experience of light and love. It emphasizes primal archetypal energies as the underlying origin of what various spiritual and religious methods think of as their differences, and leaves its readers with a model of non-duality, and the unity of pure consciousness as light and love.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Embrey includes techniques for relational solutions, various types of dreams, sleep, couples&amp;rsquo; methods for spiritual development, instructions for preparing for death and the light, and specialized exercises for meditation practice. The conclusion of this book indicates the meaning of life as a continual process of developing Consciousness from one lifetime to another, for the purpose of Consciousness itself becoming self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By reading and working intimately with &lt;em&gt;A Training Ground for Love,&lt;/em&gt; you will be doing yourself, your partner, and the cosmos an inestimable favor and blessing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
