  <title>We Are Here - Denny Reynolds, Ron Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; What would you do if you began receiving communications from an Inner Voice? What if the Voice brought you more understanding, love and abundance? What if that Voice enhanced your Spiritual growth? What would you do if you realized that your experience could be a universal experience - available to everyone willing to &quot;ask&quot; and &quot;listen?&quot;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ron Reynolds, a radio newsman, and his wife Denny Reynolds, a California Marriage and Family Therapist, relate their experience after accidentally discovering this Voice Within. The information, which Ron channeled while in a light trance state, was tape- recorded and is shared for the first time in this remarkable chronicle. Every session began with the greeting, &quot;We are here,&quot; and proceeded to impart profound pieces of wisdom, guidance, and answers to personal questions pertinent to everyday life situations and challenges. In time, &quot;The We&quot; became known not only as a dear and loving friend, but also a trusted advisor and teacher. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The events recorded by Ron and Denny unfolded over a span of two decades and provided a spiritual adventure in the tradition of Edgar Cayce, &quot;the sleeping prophet;&quot; Neal Donald Walsch, author of &lt;i&gt;Conversations with God&lt;/i&gt;: Helen Schucman, who took the dictation that became &lt;i&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/i&gt;; and Jane Roberts, who channeled the Seth material. In Chapter Nine you will learn a simple process for creating your own spiritual awakening by learning to tap in to your Inner Voice to receive the gifts of Spirit. The Voice for God lives within each of us.
