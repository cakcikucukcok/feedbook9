  <title>Wise Up - Soni Shalini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My debut book Wise Up is a bringing together of all worldliness and wisdom that heaped upon my soul, as I walked, hand in hand with life, breathing, feeling and touching it, moment by moment. It is not a biography, but whispers of wisdom by handpicked living souls that crossed my path and touched my life. Here, I have tried to paint my experiences into lessons of learning in three compartments, primarily, my childhood, secondly mothers illness and ultimately my soul mate who has been a life coach, in a vibrant, entertaining, amusing but intriguing and inspirational manner. The book is a complete walk through of captivating, alluring and spellbinding stories of value and wisdom; articles of worthiness that showcases gospel of learning, these stories are real life experiences as well as grandmother fables. I believe these gems and jewels will touch the core of your heart, soul and spirit, encouraging you to live an ecstatic, hearty and blissful life." />
