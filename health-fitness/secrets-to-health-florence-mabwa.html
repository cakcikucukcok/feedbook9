  <title>SECRETS  To HEALTH - Florence Mabwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Florence W. Mabwa MBA, BSc (Hons) ACIB, and CeMAP is an experienced financial consultant, who, later in life, underwent a paradigm shift in her mentality about her diet and nutrition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Following ill-health and personal loss, and equipped with a revolutionised mindset of life, Florence Mabwa embarked on a journey of self-discovery, to reveal the power contained within the buried gems of diet and nutrition. After enrolling in several courses, she became a diet specialist, focusing on nutrition for weight loss, metabolism and healthy eating. The paradigm shift mentioned above was brought about mainly by the unearthing of the book, &amp;ldquo;The Essene Gospel of Peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
This &amp;ldquo;Gospel,&amp;rdquo; which the author E. B. Szekely claimed to have translated from ancient documents found in the Vatican, contained what appeared to be the teaching of Jesus Christ on the matters of human diet and nutrition. It is immaterial whether Szekely&amp;rsquo;s claim of authenticity is genuine, the book was the catalyst that transformed Florence&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; and it is her deepest desire that it transforms your life too.&lt;br /&gt;
This book is the result of her years of personal research, trial and error, and sacrifice in her own efforts at changing her lifestyle to be in line with the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is published with the hope that others may become similarly helped in their diet and lifestyle choices, being enlightened by the unusual, yet captivating, &amp;ldquo;Gospel&amp;rdquo; which inspired her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
