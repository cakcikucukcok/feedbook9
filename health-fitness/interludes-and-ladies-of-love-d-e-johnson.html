      <meta name="description" content="Interludes and Ladies of Love
The old institution of love has long out lived the values it may have once held in yesteryear. Good providing has always been the main factor but, it has gone deep and dark into plain, vain materialistic gain. In todays high-tech fast paced world where women are more likely to be the bread winner than the man; the definition of love has taken a whole new meaning. Interludes and Ladies of Love gives a glimpse into the mind of women, and how they view love today. The authors life experiences, and observations was the reason he wrote this book; Inspired by God to write how love is rapidly deteriorating in todays society, and with the acceptance of loves lowering level as long as theres a profit to be made, and no spiritual thought is given to their actions to attain it. Love and relationships are like everything else economically controlled, and can be virtually shut down in most cases where money takes priority over love. Unless women formulate a higher consciousness spiritually, and think outside of the box that constrict the mentality of todays society things will inevitably get worse in love land. Interludes and Ladies of Love is an in depth look behind the scene of what appear before the eyes of man, taking a look into loves unseen deceptions. Sympathy is expressed for the so-called manipulator of women (pimps) because, they havent realized yet, that the only true pimps are women, and they (the men) have pimped out nobody but themselves through their arrogant ignominy, and dependency on the ladies of love to provide financial security. Glimpse inside the unsavory interludes women delve into with hidden motivations held within what appear to be wide open, and innocent. Through the beauty of their bodies women truly do make themselves a power to be reckoned with in this world that feels a need to satisfy its insatiable sensations for money by any means necessary." />
