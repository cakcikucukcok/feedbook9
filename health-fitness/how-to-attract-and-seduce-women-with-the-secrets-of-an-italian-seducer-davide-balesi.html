  <title>How to attract and seduce women with the secrets of an italian seducer - Davide Balesi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the world of seduction who has done the same thing, will always get the same results! There is nothing more truthful but this sentence! If you haven&amp;#39;t obtain success with women in all this time, you don&amp;#39;t have to wait any more. Seduction is natural! Is an instinctive process which is created between man and woman. Is an instinct dictated by the laws of nature! Nature wants your reproduction. For animals it is simple, why should it be difficult for humans? Maybe because we are endowed with reason? I think not! On the contrary, this is one thing that should help in the process of coupling with the opposite sex. It could happen sometimes that little interferences are created in the process of seduction, but it is not nature that creates them, we create them! I will explain how to be an alpha male in modern society, the society of the evolution of the roles! Seduction is simply and this is natural! Davide Balesi was born in 1979 in Italy. He wrote a lot of books about interpersonal relations: they are bestsellers in Italy. Balesi is one of the most important italian seducers." />
