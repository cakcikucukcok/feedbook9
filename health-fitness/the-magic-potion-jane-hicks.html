  <title>The Magic Potion - Jane Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This tale is based on a true story and was written for my son and his family. But they are not the only ones who have lived what you will read on these pages. &lt;br /&gt;
There are many families who suffer unnecessarily due to hard feelings that separation and divorce can bring about. Divorce is not only hard on children; it is also a traumatic experience for the adults, even though they often will not admit it.&lt;br /&gt;
My goal in writing this book is to provide everyone with the recipe that worked for my family and can work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
We all have the power to change our lives at any point we choose. We have the power to be anything we desirebe it happy, sad, or even madwe ourselves have the control.&lt;br /&gt;
Life does not just happen to us; we make it happen for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magic Potion gives a succinct recipe that inspires hope while providing suggestions to follow in the recovery process. Children, just like adults, are capable of following tips that will eventually enhance their own lives. &lt;br /&gt;
