  <title>My Son, My Gentle Son - Robert Greenwald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Robert Greenwalds narrative is enveloping, rendered with honesty, compassion and emotional impact.  This is the true story of his son, born with a congenital heart disease.  At six weeks of age he went into heart/respiratory failure, suffering extensive brain damage that left him profoundly disabled both mentally and physically.  The special relationship that develops between this father and his son embraces so many of the themes and issues common to parents of special children.  The story takes a penetrating, introspective view of the emotional conflicts and self-doubt involved in parenting a child with disabilities.  It deals candidly with the depression and sense of loss brought on by his sons early diagnosis and, years later, his death.  It movingly chronicles the changes wrought in family life, family roles and sense of purpose by this special child.&lt;/P&gt;" />
