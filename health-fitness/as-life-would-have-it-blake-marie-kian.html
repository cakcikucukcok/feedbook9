  <title>As Life Would Have It. - Blake Marie Kian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three beautiful robust women engage in some of lifes most precarious and obscure space with men that take their breath away. Olivia, Sandi and Jannie sojourn through seasons of hot, intense sensuality and amazing desires a woman experiences with men who are in the same space. The women are smart, attractive and have reached an over the top status of sensuality and passion in their lives. They are good girls who at times get caught up. Their passion is all consuming at times, yet they find balance throughout their journeys.
Readers comments: 
As Life would Have It is such a phenomenal book! It takes one on a journey of passion, igniting the senses, and keeps one engaged from beginning to end. 
There are healing, spiritual, and emotional realities in the book as well as profound life lessons. There is no way to anticipate the level of intensity that one experiences with this book.

Very true! Deep T. Bruce-Smith 
Amazing journeys. These women are my sisters! Fabulous read.  M. Lewis 
I enjoyed reading it and found your book to be insightful, inspiring and healing. You skillfully capture the essence of relationships to include how exciting and dysfunctional they can be if the effort is not made to work on them diligently and communicate our needs as well as compromise and reciprocate our emotions, desires in a transparent manner. Some parts of your book took my breath away while others made me laugh and cry. I was able to identify with the women portrayed and gain valuable insight from their experiences.
