  <title>A Girl Like Me - Simply Sue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am so grateful for the ability to step beyond my old limits to experience and participate in my own life.
Who is the least likely person to reach for her dreams, to step over the baggage that the family disease of alcoholism can create? Who is the least likely person to rise above the loneliness, isolation, and fear of her own shadow?
A Girl like Me ...thats who.
Simply Sue starts out with a compelling story of struggle, strength, and courage as her faith grows and blossoms in her spirit, awakening her ability to walk through fear after fear to be a part of her dreams coming true, drawing others in to share with light and love of God. Sometimes you have to step out in order to step intrust in God and tie your camel to a tree. So grab a cup of tea and your favorite afghan and curl up with A Girl like Me. Simply Sue will take you through a bit of her life from there to here and share stories that will make you laugh and cry or nod your head. Come along and experience the transformation first-hand and be inspired to become willing to be all you are meant to be!
Remember, faith does not take away our humanness; it restores our ability to remember who we are.
