  <title>The Sage&#39;s Way - Ray Grigg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;With uncommon insight, &lt;B&gt;The Sage&#39;s Way&lt;/B&gt; uses the tradition of Oriental wisdom to explore such common subjects as acceptance, patience, power, self, grace, grief and laughter. Think of its Prologue and 64 Chapters as the Eastern philosophical equivalent of Kahlil Gibran&#39;s &lt;I&gt;The Prophet&lt;/I&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;Each chapter is composed of a teaching and a commentary. The teachings- from a mysterious sage of Mount Shan- are concise and dense, somewhat like the enigmatic pronouncements that might come from a reclusive mystic. The commentaries- offered by Old Shu, a remarkable hunchback living a life of contented simplicity- are wonderfully sensible and wise, somewhat like our own deepest awareness when we are introspective, honest, trusting and intuitive. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;The Sage&#39;s Way&lt;/B&gt; leads readers toward an awareness that will inspire inner strength and quiet serenity. This is the best of Oriental wisdom, the essence of both Taoism and Zen presented with a grounded clarity that is both deeply challenging and elegantly simple. As such, this book is likely to become a lifetime companion, offering day-to-day guidance while providing poignant readings for special occasions.
&lt;P&gt;Author of internationally sold books &lt;I&gt;The Tao of Relationships, The Tao of Being, The Tao of Sailing, Zen Brushpoems, The Tao of Zen, The New Lao Tzu&lt;/I&gt;, Ray Grigg is eminently qualified to offer this work to those who are seeking a balanced and harmonious way through the sometimes bewildering challenges of ordinary life." />
