  <title>Mommy Burnout - Dr. Sheryl G. Ziegler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ultimate must-read handbook for the modern mother: a practical, and positive tool to help free women from the debilitating notion of being the &quot;perfect mom,&quot; filled with funny and all too relatable true-life stories and realistic suggestions to stop the burnout cycle, and protect our kids from the damage burnout can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moms, do you feel tired? Overwhelmed? Have you continually put off the things you need to do for you? Do you feel like it&amp;#8217;s all worth it because your kids are happy? Are you &quot;over&quot; being a mother? If you answered yes to these questions, you&amp;#8217;re not alone. Parents today want to create the ideal childhood for their children. Women strive to be the picture-perfect Pinterest mother that looks amazing, hosts the best birthday parties in town, posts the most &quot;liked&quot; photos, and serves delicious, nutritious home-cooked meals in her neat, organized home after ferrying the kids to school and a host of extracurricular activities on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drive, while noble, can also be destructive, causing stress and anxiety that leads to &quot;mommy burnout.&quot; Psychologist and family counselor Dr. Sheryl Ziegler is well-versed in the stress that moms face, and the burden of guilt they carry because they often feel like they aren&amp;#8217;t doing enough for their kids&amp;#8217; happiness. A mother of three herself, Dr. Z&amp;#8212;as she&amp;#8217;s affectionately known by her many patients&amp;#8212;recognizes and understands that modern moms are all too often plagued by exhaustion, failure, isolation, self-doubt, and a general lack of self-love, and their families are also feeling the effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last nineteen years working with families and children, Dr. Z has devised a prescriptive program for addressing &quot;mommy burnout&quot;&amp;#8212;teaching moms that they can learn to re-energize themselves and still feel good about their families and their lives. In this warm and empathetic guide, she examines this modern epidemic among mothers who put their children&amp;#8217;s happiness above their own, and offers empowering, proven solutions for alleviating this condition, saving marriages and keeping kids happy in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
