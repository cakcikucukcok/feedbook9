  <title>The P.E.O.P.L.E. Programme - John Kenny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We create our thoughts, we trigger our emotions, and this determines the ways in which we act and behave. How we react or respond leads to our outcomes, both positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all see things in our own way and act accordingly based on our perceptions and the meaning we give to events that have happened and will happen in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us remain in the world of our subconscious, making choices and fulfilling needs based on the things that we learnt many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important relationship that we ever have is the one we have with ourselves as it drives the direction of our lives. This book has been written to help you to understand what that relationship is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know where your thoughts come from? Why you feel like you do sometimes? Why you have a compulsion to act in certain ways when you know you may want to act differently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been holding you back for all of these years from having the relationships that you want, from achieving in life when you know that you can?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The P.E.O.P.L.E. Programme will not only help you to understand all of these things but will give you the tools to ensure you can overcome your blocks to success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come on a journey with me: see how I managed to change my life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
