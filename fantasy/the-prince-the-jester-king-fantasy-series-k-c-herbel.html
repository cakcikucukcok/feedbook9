  <title>The Prince: The Jester King Fantasy Series - K. C. Herbel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Tirn Aill, Billy is challenged by many discoveries: his fae blood, his ability to use magic, and a powerful enchantment placed on him by his mother. But unraveling her spell has dire consequences, and the faerie folk soon find their kingdom in peril. To avert a cataclysm, Billy needs a &amp;ldquo;spellbinder,&amp;rdquo; but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know what that is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, he&amp;rsquo;s receiving more visions of the future - of dead kingdoms and dying friends. War has come to Lyonesse, eagerly served by a wrathful Gwythian prince, sworn to revenge his brother&amp;rsquo;s death with Lady Cyndyn&amp;rsquo;s blood. So, Billy must return to war-torn Lyonesse to save Myrredith from her executioner, but can he save her and still save Tirn Aill?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, King Ergyfel prepares for Billy&amp;rsquo;s return. To keep his stolen throne, he summons demons from the ancient world. However, Ergyfel is not prepared for the extraordinary cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; is the third of four novels in The Jester King Fantasy Series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
