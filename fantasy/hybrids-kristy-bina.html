Of course, all she managed to do was to get herself kidnapped too. Then, she finds out that they intended to use her as a sex slave and the extremely hot but also somewhat scary guy that she got kidnapped with is trying to convince her that hes a one hundred and twelve year old werepanther; although he is offering to escape and take her with him. Only she ended up being the one to save him! Although not before one of them bit her! Now shes found herself in a huge supernatural whirlwind and she wouldnt have time to kill herself even if she still wanted to. Its amazing how quickly someones life can change. Shes been turned into a freak of nature, being stalked by werewolves because of a date gone horribly wrong and accused of murder that she didnt commit by her boss and the local police. Plus, shes being dragged around the world in an attempt to save her life and others. It seems her dreams of action and adventure just slapped her in the face.
