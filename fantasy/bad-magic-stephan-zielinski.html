  <title>Bad Magic - Stephan Zielinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magic is real. Strange forces and uncanny creatures abound. Cosmic evil is loose in the world--especially around San Diego--along with transcendent evil, primordial evil, simmering evil, objective evil, and specific evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sheer self-defense, most of the human race long ago taught themselves to shut their magical Third Eye, blinding themselves to this supernatural world around them. As protection goes, it&#39;s not 100% effective, but it&#39;s still pretty good: If you can&#39;t see them, they can&#39;t see you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the rest of us, a few people can deal with the weirdness. In San Francisco, a motley group of adventurers have banded together to fight evil. They&#39;re an uncanny mix of alchemists, thaumaturges, necromancers, and totemists, working their wildly different magics in a milieu where thaumaturgy is a laboratory science and raw pain can be kept in a flask of liquid nitrogen. They know they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. And they have to save a world that doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s under attack from forces that they wish were beyond comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poised, headspinning, and richly inventive, &lt;i&gt;Bad Magic&lt;/i&gt; from Stephan Zielinski shows us what people really see when their third eye opens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
