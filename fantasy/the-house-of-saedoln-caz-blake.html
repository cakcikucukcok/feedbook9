  <title>The House of Saedoln - Caz Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The House of Saedoln is the protector of the magical world of Astulorn. Tranquility is shattered as an evil lord emerges. He is hell-bent on destroying Saedoln and taking over Astulorn with his armies of the dread beast Glurfang. Shenars parents and brothers stand against the evil lord and manage to destroy him as he storms their fortress in Gadomar. 
But he takes them unawares and uses his dying breath to summon all the destructive force he can to engulf the fortress in a ball of white fire, destroying all within its walls. With the fall of Saedoln, the Glurfang seized the opportunity to once and for all end the bloodline of the protectors and hunt down Shenar. Her husband, Charnuis lord of the dragons of Golconade, races to defend her and their newborn son, only to be struck down passing through the narrow gorge of Shardolan mountains. 
Shenar must flee for her life astride her mysterious steed Naturem. Aided by the power coursing through her veins, she abandons Astulorn to escape into a new and barely known worldours. 
But when her world begs for her return, will she answer the call?" />
