  <title>The Ouroh Trilogy - Thomas D. Bryson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are few books that surprise their readers on every pageeven fewer that show readers how to live. Boldly, the OUROH trilogy does both. Trevor and Trudy, siblings from Earth, take an unforgettable journey through these pages, a journey you will gladly take alongside them; theyre the kind of inspiring characters that live and breathe on the page and live on in your mind and heart long after the storys final word. You cant help but root for and identify with them. Their journey is rich with the power of words and wishes, spoken and unspoken. Its a journey not only through time (recycled time), but past time; not only through our known universe, but past it to another, and another (Ouroh is the center of thirteen multiverses); not only through our minds and senses, but past what weve been conditioned to perceive to a whole new way of seeing and knowing. This epic tale has been created by a master storyteller and modern-day philosopher, one who understands that acknowledging lifes interconnectedness and relying on present-moment awareness are the keys to true happiness. But you wont be pummeled with speeches or agendas; instead, this wisdom is skillfully woven into the narratives fabric.
Trevor and Trudy are joined by Ideas and Imagination, their Ouroh counterparts, as well as an unforgettable cast of supporting characters, including the fascinating Planimals (part plant, part animal, in a myriad of astounding varieties). Thrumming with heart-pounding tension and suspense, the story asks: Will the children save the multiverses from an errant word? Will they right the word that went wrong?
In a time when people complain that there is nothing new under the sun, it is quite a rare achievement to discover a book unlike any other. The OUROH trilogy is a true gift indeed." />
