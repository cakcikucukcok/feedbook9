&lt;br /&gt;
Killers of the Flower Moon is the latest novel from author David Grann. This nonfiction book is about the murder of the Osage Native American tribe in the 1920s. The Osage tribe was forced off their land by the United States government. They moved to Oklahoma and oil was discovered on their land. The oil money made them wealthy enough to buy mansions and cars. They were able to send their children to boarding schools in Europe. Then, tragedy struck. One by one, the members of the Osage tribe turned up murdered in various ways -- gunshots, poisoning, and explosions. David Grann follows the trail of who was responsible for the murders and what happened to the Osage.&lt;br /&gt;
Killers of the Flower Moon has been called the best book released in 2017 by Entertainment Weekly, and it has been labeled as &amp;quot;extraordinary&amp;quot; by Time Magazine&lt;br /&gt;
