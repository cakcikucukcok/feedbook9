The Owens family has been cursed in love since their ancestor, Maria Owens, was charged with being a witch in the 1600s. In 1960s New York City, Susanna Owens is raising her three children: Franny, Jet, and Vincent. Susanna knows that her children are witches, and therefore, she lays down some rules for them. They cannot wear black, read about magic, use candles, have cats or crows, and most importantly, they cannot fall in love. The children go to visit their Aunt Isabelle in a small Massachusetts town, where the Owens have been the blame of every bad thing that has happened. While there, they discover the truth about themselves and their family. When they return to New York City, they try to liberate themselves from the Owens curse.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Rules of Magic became a bestseller for The New York Times immediately after it&amp;#39;s release in October of 2017. It has also been selected as part of Reese Witherspoon&amp;#39;s Book Club.&lt;br /&gt;
