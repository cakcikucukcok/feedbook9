  <title>White Men Make the Best Lovers - Flora Pickett-Coley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="White Men Make The Best Lovers is a true love story.  Although the author at times added fiction to try and conceal her identity.  Her co-workers, friends and family knew distinctively that the book was a depiction of the authors relationship with the man she referred to as Max and that she was Danielle.  
This love story is about two lovers who knew they wanted and needed more than a casual relationship.  Having been disappointed in love, they knew that being patient would bring the right person into their life. They both wanted and got to experience what it feels like to truly be in love.  A love so pure that each time they made love it was like binding their very soul.  They had an intense sexual desire for each other that neither time nor distance could sever.  Their desire to make love was fuel with a fiery passion.  Max is the smooth ultimate lover. He nibbled her breast softly. Her nipples between his teeth caused her to reach the peak of orgasmic delight. She sighed with pleasure.
Only true love can last a life time.  Max and Danielles love was unconditional. Their love for each other allowed them to discuss their differences without destroying their relationship.  They knew what most people never discover.  That love has no color.  
Max made sure Danielle knew she was loved, by catering to her every need and spending every moment with her in his arms.  Max had not dated anyone seriously since his divorce, nor was he looking. They had both been hurt and disappointed by love.  Falling in love was not what they had planned, but fate knew they needed more than just a casual relationship. 
Max and Danielle were wise enough to see the beauty of their love.  A deep committed love that went beyond the surface of their relationship. It was more than skin deep. When pain and tragedy reared its ugly head, Max was determined not to lose her.  He would win her back and save their relationship by any means necessary." />
