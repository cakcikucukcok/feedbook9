  <title>The John Maclay MEGAPACK® - John Maclay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the publisher&#39;s introduction: &quot;I first became aware of John Maclay not as a writer, but as a publisher -- of the now-classic &quot;Masques&quot; horror anthology series, edited by the late, great J.N. Williamson, and a number of other books. When the original Masques appeared, I remember looking at the spine and noting that it was published a company called Maclay that I had never heard of before. But that name stuck, and soon I began noting John Maclay&#39;s stories in various anthologies and magazines. He -- like many of the dark fantasists who emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- had a distinctive voice, very different from the fantasists who came before. He still writes that way, fusing horror, fantasy, and suspense (often with an erotic element).&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Over the years, John has steadily built up an impressing body of work, and I am delighted that he accepted my invitation to contribute a volume to the MEGAPACK® series. So here are 15 modern classics of dark fiction. Enjoy!&quot;&lt;P&gt;
Included are:&lt;P&gt;
NEW YORK NIGHT&lt;BR&gt;
A YOUNGER WOMAN&lt;BR&gt;
LYNN&lt;BR&gt;
KARI&lt;BR&gt;
THE ONE THING TO FEAR&lt;BR&gt;
WIDOWED&lt;BR&gt;
TOM RUDOLPH&#39;S LAST TAPE&lt;BR&gt;
STARDOM&lt;BR&gt;
MAX&lt;BR&gt;
THE HOLE&lt;BR&gt;
WHO WALKS AT NIGHT&lt;BR&gt;
THE GREEN GLASS BOTTLE&lt;BR&gt;
AN IRON MAIDEN&lt;BR&gt;
LATE LAST NIGHT&lt;BR&gt;
IF IT’S ALL THE SAME TO YOU&lt;P&gt;
