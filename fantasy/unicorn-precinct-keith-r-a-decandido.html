When she&amp;#39;s found murdered, with the culprit&amp;#39;s identity hidden from the magickal examiner&amp;#39;s spells, the Captain of the Guard sends his best investigators. Ex-soldier Torin ban Wyvald and half-elf Danthres Tresyllione have two viable suspects: Arra&amp;#39;s fianc&amp;eacute;, who is the cousin of another member of the Castle Guard, or the unknown person with whom Arra was having a torrid affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torin and Danthres must navigate the difficult political waters of Cliff&amp;#39;s End&amp;#39;s upper classes in an attempt to determine the girl&amp;#39;s killer.
