  <title>Warrior of the Way - Nathan Chandler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Civil war is a curse that touches everyone, including King Tashdar of the Mulamar. When he is ordered by a powerful and mysterious stranger to send warriors toward Kanai and Kadisha to slaughter everyone, Tashdar has no choice but to obey. As the Hebari emperors palace is invaded, only one man escapesa captain of the guard to whom the emperor has entrusted the safety of his remaining two children. Moments later, the emperors legacy is erased from the face of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than forty years later, Pasha Nuvahli of the Sashramans tribe, greatest of the kings warriors, is devastated when his wife is murdered and his son is kidnapped. Overcome with despair as war and a dangerous sorcerer threaten the southern tribes, Pasha soon finds himself in a crisis of faith as he ponders why Daiyu has allowed such sorrow to befall him. But after he learns of an ancient prophecy and his hidden connection to the last emperor of the south, Pasha is sent by King Juktan to seek an alliance with the five other Hebari tribes and lead them against an ancient enemy from the north. Suddenly, his life takes on a new meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling story, a worried king looks to his greatest warrior to unify the south with the hope the young soldier can save his people before all is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
