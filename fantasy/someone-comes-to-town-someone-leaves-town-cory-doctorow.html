  <title>Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town - Cory Doctorow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cory Doctorow&#39;s miraculous novel of family history, Internet connectivity, and magical secrets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan is a middle-aged entrepeneur who moves to a bohemian neighborhood of Toronto. Living next door is a young woman who reveals to him that she has wings--which grow back after each attempt to cut them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan understands. He himself has a secret or two. His father is a mountain, his mother is a washing machine, and among his brothers are sets of Russian nesting dolls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now two of the three dolls are on his doorstep, starving, because their innermost member has vanished. It appears that Davey, another brother who Alan and his siblings killed years ago, may have returned, bent on revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the circumstances it seems only reasonable for Alan to join a scheme to blanket Toronto with free wireless Internet, spearheaded by a brilliant technopunk who builds miracles from scavenged parts. But Alan&#39;s past won&#39;t leave him alone--and Davey isn&#39;t the only one gunning for him and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whipsawing between the preposterous, the amazing, and the deeply felt,  Cory Doctorow&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town&lt;/i&gt; is unlike any novel you have ever read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
