  <title>The Perfect Spouse: A Novel - Sioux Dallas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can anyone identify a perfect spouse?  Is there such a person? You&#39;ll know the truth after you read &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Spouse.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jason is the protagonist of the story, but the book is primarily about The Perfect Spouse and their plans for other people. Jason didn&#39;t want a lot of fanfare for his second wedding because he had a wonderful marriage previously, but he wanted his new wife Siobhan to have a memorable wedding day. Why was so much attention given to him? That&#39;s called writer&#39;s license. Is there such a thing as a perfect spouse? You tell me.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sioux Dallas started creating stories when she heard a great-uncle telling original stories that made him famous.   She began writing hers down in the third grade.  By the seventh grade teachers were encouraging her to do something with her work.  Teaching at school, taking care of a family, raising and training horses, giving riding lessons, her music, and working in the church all took time.  Dallas started taking her writing more seriously and undertook the necessary steps to have it published after she retired and was a widow.  &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Spouse&lt;/i&gt; is her fifth published book, and she is currently working on three others." />
