  <title>Ripples Roping Memories - Usha Raman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Partridge India has released a book of poems, Drifting Emotions and Flowering Thoughts authored by Usha Raman. It is a lyrical celebration of experiences. Another book are leaves from the 1960s which springs into Ripples Roping Memories, a fiction radiating into experiences. Walking to school with a school bag on her shoulder, Rani gazes at her surroundings and findings and revels in her sweet and resents her bitter experiences. Rani makes a comment about doctors. I considered doctors as healers who could mend peoples bodies. Doctors can drive away disease and pain. I revered them. The guilt feeling which Rani feels after stealing-  My fabric of morality was stained. Fear and remorse ruled me. Pleasant experiences are- These songs infiltrated into my psyche and sowed a pleasant feeling  Excerpts which reveal unpleasant experiences  My head would become a sudden sweeping merry go round and I would slump on the floor Innocence and ignorance combined in me and aroused fear. A mothers attempt to blackmail is evident in the lines- Kanna, I am the only one mother of yours, You must listen to your mother or I am going to cut my wrist with a knife Do you want me or your friends? Atrocities against women leads her to believe  It seems there is no security im marriage. Child abuse develops A constant feeling of disrespect towards elders continued to dwell in my mind.
Reading the book Ripples Roping Memories helps one to experience cosmopolitan Indian society. It is a slow moving life where Rani gets time to observe. Din of commercialisation makes a slow penetration into Vanavli. It is an overall composite wade into middle class Indian life. Villas, chawls and shanties existed side by side.
