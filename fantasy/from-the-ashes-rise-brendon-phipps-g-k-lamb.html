  <title>From The Ashes, Rise - Brendon Phipps, G K Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is 2165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our world has been devastated by nuclear war, intense climate change, rampant disease, accidentally manufactured plague and strict regimes. Every Supreme Country has their version of what happened; what happened and between whom. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many alive today who remember the original cause for so much destruction, much less why it went on so long. They&amp;rsquo;ve all long since died off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long ago our world was a much different place. A place where advancement was celebrated, where art in any form was worshiped and where the people lived. Really lived. Today our lives are rules by strict men with even stricter rules, who employ cruel men to carry out those rules. Every Supreme Country has a different title for their leader, a different set of rules, however they are, in essence, all the same. Every Supreme Country has a set of rules of what is and is not allowed within their borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the stories that don&amp;rsquo;t fit into those rules. These are the stories of the people; poor, rich, young, old, we have all been affected by the changes in past years. In that way, we are all the same. The leaders would have us believe otherwise; they would have us believe we are better than our fellow man. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are stories the leaders don&amp;rsquo;t want you to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are stories about the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are stories about life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the Apocrypha.&lt;/p&gt;" />
