  <title>Prophecy Unravelled - Kathryn Royce-Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prince Aidan&#39;s life was mapped out. He would be the King of Therin when his father died. He would protect the people, lead the army to fight for the Kingdom and he liked to think that he would be remembered for his skills as a warrior and strategist. The arrival of Tarienne at Castle Therin changed everything. In the space of three years, she managed to turn his world upside down, challenging everything Aidan believed in.
Charged with protecting Prince Aidan so that he could fulfill a prophecy that he knew nothing of, Tarienne didn&#39;t expect to become his friend and confidante, nor be part of a ruse, feigning courtship with the classically handsome Prince. Despite her relationship with Aidan, the passion that Daien, Aidan&#39;s dearest friend and one of the King&#39;s Guards, ignites within Tarienne from the moment they meet, complicates her life at court. Can she keep her magical abilities a secret, maintain the pretence of loving Aidan, convince him of his role in the prophecy, and, make the breathtakingly handsome warrior, Daien, aware of her interest, all under the ever watchful scrutiny of an unforgiving King, who is vehemently opposed to magic?" />
