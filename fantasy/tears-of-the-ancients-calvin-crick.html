He has no knowledge of his past, and his future is just as unknown. He has only just returned to the village of his childhood after a year spent wandering the Smoking Mountains. He survives a dangerous encounter with the Clan of Dragons, enemies of his adopted people. Even so, Loots return does not bring celebration, and some people even feel he should be punished. They have no idea that Loot is the key to the worlds salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boy has the power to save the human race and perhaps even to return the ancient dragons to places of power. As his mysterious past begins to reveal itself, it soon becomes clear that he is much more than a weak orphan boy. Before he can become a hero, though, he must first come to terms with his hidden historyand prepare for battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
