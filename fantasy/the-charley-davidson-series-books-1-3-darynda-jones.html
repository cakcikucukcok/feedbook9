  <title>The Charley Davidson Series, Books 1-3 - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darynda Jones has garnered a strong following with her series starring Grim Reaper Charley Davidson. Here together for the first time in a stunning eBook bundle are the first three novels in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling paranormal series:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Grave on the Right&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Charley sees dead people. And it&#39;s her job to convince them to &quot;go into the light.&quot; But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (i.e., murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she&#39;s been having about an Entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Grave on the Left&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;When Charley and Cookie, her best friend slash receptionist, have to track down a missing woman, the case is not quite as open and shut as they anticipate. Meanwhile, Reyes Alexander Farrow (otherwise known as the Son of Satan. Yes. Literally.) has left his corporeal body because he&#39;s being tortured by demons who want to lure Charley closer. But Reyes can&#39;t let that happen. Because if the demons get to Charley, they&#39;ll have a portal to heaven. And if they have a portal to heaven...well, let&#39;s just say it wouldn&#39;t be pretty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Grave Dead Ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Every time Charley closes her eyes, she sees him: Reyes Farrow, the part-human, part-supermodel son of Satan. Yes, she did imprison him for all eternity, but come on. How is she supposed to solve a missing persons case, deal with an ego-driven doctor, calm her curmudgeonly dad, and take on a motorcycle gang hell-bent on murder when the devil&#39;s son just won&#39;t give up?&lt;/p&gt;" />
