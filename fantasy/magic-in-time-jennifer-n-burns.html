  <title>Magic in Time - Jennifer N. Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Teenage twins Scott and Raylynn hope to make it through their senior year without any mishaps. Already they have plans to go to college and
make a bright future for themselves. But on the eve of their graduation, fate takes them on an unexpected journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their eighteenth birthday, the siblings are thrown into a time and place that is eerily familiar. Their mother, who passed away three years ago, used to tell them fascinating fairy tales before bedtime, and now they have been catapulted to a world just like she described. Only here, they are not ordinary teenagers, but a prince and a princess in the kingdom of Willowbare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott is intended to take inherit the throne, but the existing ruler, King Raytheon, and his evil wizard appear ready to take any steps necessaryincluding murderto make sure that wont happen. While trying to figure out their new roles and stay one step ahead of the wizard, memories from the pastfrom when they really were the prince and princess of Willowbarebegin to emerge. Now they must decide
whether to stay or return to their former lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one question haunts them both: Is their future really in their past? &lt;/p&gt;" />
