  <title>The Seduction of Phaeton Black - Jillian Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the gaslit streets of Victorian London, phantoms rule the night, demons dance till dawn, and one supernatural detective dares to be seduced by the greatest power of all.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;He&#39;s The Man With The Magic Touch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A master of deduction, seduction and other midnight maneuvers, Phaeton Black is Scotland Yard&#39;s secret weapon against things that go bump in the night. His prodigious gifts as a paranormal investigator are as legendary as his skills as a lover, his weakness for wicked women as notorious as his affection for absinthe. But when he&#39;s asked to hunt down a fanged femme fatale who drains her victims of blood, he walks right into the arms of the most dangerous woman he&#39;s ever known.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;She&#39;s The Devilish Miss Jones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pressing a knife to his throat--and demanding he make love to her--Miss America Jones uses Phaeton as a willing shield against the gang of pirates chasing her. As deadly as she is, with a derringer tucked in her garter, Miss Jones is not the vampiric killer he&#39;s been staking out--but she may be just what Phaeton needs to crack the case. As the daughter of a Cajun witch, she possesses uncanny powers. As a fearless fighter, she can handle anything from Egyptian mummies to Jack the Ripper. But when an ancient evil is unleashed on the world, she could be his only salvation.  .  .or ultimate sacrifice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[A] dark Victorian concoction.  .  .sexy as hell!&quot; --Ray Garton, author of &lt;i&gt;Live Girls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A sexy, supernatural romp!&quot; --Zo&amp;#235; Archer" />
