  <title>Outcast - Cheryl Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sold into slavery when his planet was destroyed, Lynx was enslaved in a harem. He is a favorite due to his feline gene, which gives him remarkable sexual powers, but after ten years, Lynx is exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrown out without a penny, Lynx is bitter and anti-female. He emigrates to a new planet but can only find a job with a female rancher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonnie&#39;s boyfriend has left with all their money and she needs help with the ranch. Lynx is cynical, but honest, and though he has made it clear that he wants no part of a romantic relationship, Bonnie can&#39;t resist him. She finds out about his impotence and becomes determined not to let such a beautiful and sensual young man go to waste.&lt;br&gt;The fourth book in wildly popular Cat Star Chronicles, a paranormal romance series featuring heroes with a feline gene that gives them remarkable sexual powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cat Star Chronicles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slave (Book 1)&lt;br&gt;Warrior (Book 2)&lt;br&gt;Rogue (Book 3)&lt;br&gt;Outcast (Book 4)&lt;br&gt;Fugitive (Book 5)&lt;br&gt;Hero (Book 6)&lt;br&gt;Virgin (Book 7)&lt;br&gt;Stud (Book 8)&lt;br&gt;Wildcat (Book 9)&lt;br&gt;Rebel (Book 10) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Cheryl Brooks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Brooks presents a nice futuristic story with some interesting worlds and Aliens in this Cat Star Chronicles offering.
