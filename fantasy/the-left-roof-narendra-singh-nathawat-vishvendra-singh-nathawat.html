  <title>The Left Roof - Narendra Singh Nathawat, Vishvendra Singh Nathawat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alfred Riston is a twenty-two-year-old college student who is heartbroken by his mothers abandonment of her family. As he attempts to grapple with his pain, he begins experiencing strange visions and hearing a voice that seems to come from nowhere. There is no question that an unseen force is attempting to make contact with Alfred. Now all he has to do is determine who or what it is.
After he and his best friend, Khushahal, decide to investigate the weird comings-and-goings surrounding his old family home, they unwittingly confront hostile guards who seem to be protecting some sort of bizarre chemical experiment. But when he contacts his father to ask him what he knows, he is quickly pushed away without explanation. Now as a series of bizarre clues are slowly unveiled, Alfred embarks on a journey into the past where he learns the truth about his birth that will change everything, not just for him, but for the infinity world.
In this gripping fantasy story, a college student on a quest to learn the truth about himself and his family soon discovers that nothing is certain when it comes to the universe." />
