  <title>The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country&#39;s Foremost Relationship Expert  by John Gottman PhD | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country&amp;#39;s Foremost Relationship Expert &amp;nbsp;by John Gottman &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A marriage can be saved if both partners remember and cherish their earlier happier days and why they fell in love with each other. But when they both have rewritten their history and communication has become impossible, the marriage will eventually fail. The determining factor in whether wives feel satisfied with the sex, romance, and passion in their marriage is, by 70 percent, the quality of the couple&amp;#39;s friendship. For men, the determining factor is, by 70 percent, the quality of the couple&amp;#39;s friendship. Four factors lead to failed marriages. These are criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Daniel Goleman, the author of Emotional Intelligence, says the book is a &amp;quot;practical guide to an emotionally intelligent -- and long-lasting -- marriage.&amp;quot; Newsweek says John Gottman has the best qualification in writing the book. He is both a scientist and a romantic.&lt;br /&gt;
The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work was a New York Times bestseller when it was first published in 2000. A new edition came out in 2015.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
