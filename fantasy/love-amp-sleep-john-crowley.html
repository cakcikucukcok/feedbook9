  <title>Love &amp;amp; Sleep - John Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In its recent review of the fourth (and final) Ægypt novel, Bookforum said: &quot;We may one day look on Ægypt&#39;s publishing history with the same head-scratching curiosity with which we now regard Melville&#39;s tragic struggles and André Gide&#39;s decision to turn down Swann&#39;s Way.+? As those words were being typed, Overlook was well into the process of reclaiming the magnificent tetralogy, and with the publication of The Solitudes, readers re-entered the fantastic world that enthralled reviewers and was enshrined in Harold Bloom&#39;s Western Canon. In Love &amp; Sleep, the second volume of the series, the professor Pierce Moffett finds himself at a great turning point in the history of the world. As a child, Pierce was no stranger to magic, but those revelations faded with time. Now Pierce&#39;s search for a secret history of the world--one in which magic works and angels speak to humankind--has begun again. Love &amp; Sleep is followed by the third volume in the Ægypt cycle, Dæmonomania, and the fourth, Endless Things.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
