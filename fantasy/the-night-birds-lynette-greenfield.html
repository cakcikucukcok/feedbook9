  <title>The Night Birds - Lynette Greenfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING INSANE?   This is what Syden is faced with every single day, while she learns how to deal with growing up in a world, it becomes apparent that loved ones don&#39;t always have her best interest at heart. The Night Birds is an emotional rollercoaster ride through childhood, adolescence, and the struggles of becoming a woman.   Follow the story of Syden&#39;s search for truth as the lines between fantasy, imagination, great love, and deep loss, merge with the painful reality of an unexplained illness and heartbreaking dissolution. In a world of temptation and lies, will Syden be able to define the difference between madness and truth..., before it&#39;s too late?   Some nights are like dreams where everything is happily beyond your control.  A good dream is when you don&#39;t want it to end, but if it does, and if you&#39;re lucky, you get to be the one who walks away.   Note: The Night Birds book has an alternate cover option." />
