  <title>Knife of Dreams - Robert Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;® is a PBS Great American Read Selection! Now in development for TV!&lt;/b&gt;        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TV series update: &lt;/b&gt;&quot;Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures. Rafe Judkins is attached to write and executive produce. Judkins previously worked on shows such as ABC&#39;s &quot;Agents of SHIELD,&quot; the Netflix series &quot;Hemlock Grove,&quot; and the NBC series &quot;Chuck.&quot; Red Eagle partners Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon will executive produce along with Radar&#39;s Ted Field and Mike Weber. Darren Lemke will also executive produce, with Jordan&#39;s widow Harriet McDougal serving as consulting producer.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Variety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;®&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Spring: The Novel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;The Eye of the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2 &lt;i&gt;The Great Hunt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3 &lt;i&gt;The Dragon Reborn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#4 &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Rising&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#5 &lt;i&gt;The Fires of Heaven&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#6 &lt;i&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#7 &lt;i&gt;A Crown of Swords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#8 &lt;i&gt;The Path of Daggers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#9 &lt;i&gt;Winter&#39;s Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#10 &lt;i&gt;Crossroads of Twilight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#11 &lt;i&gt;Knife of Dreams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;#12 &lt;i&gt;The Gathering Storm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#13 &lt;i&gt;Towers of Midnight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#14 &lt;i&gt;A Memory of Light&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The World of Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wheel of Time Companion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy Romanczuk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patterns of the Wheel: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
