  <title>Erl?Sung American English Edition - Rabbi Israel Selach Li</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God gave me a second chance. I am now what I despised in my past life. While in a coma for seven days at the age of eighteen, I was made fully aware of the evil I had done under a name that will forever live in infamy. It is still painful for me to acknowledge my connection to that name. It still shakes me to the core when I reflect on my ownership of that which came straight from the bowels of hell. It is a name synonymous with racism, greed, war, torture, murder, and systematic genocide. Why would anyone in his or her right mind want to claim such a name? But, sadly, I have no choice. I have lived with the knowledge of my previous life for more than thirty-five years, and I made a promise before the judgment seat of God that upon my death I would reveal who I was and attempt to make amends for the evil I brought into the world. In my past life, I was, without question, Adolf Hitler, the omnipotent fhrer of the National Socialist German Workers (Nazi) Party and the supreme leader of Germany from 1934 to 1945.&lt;/p&gt;" />
