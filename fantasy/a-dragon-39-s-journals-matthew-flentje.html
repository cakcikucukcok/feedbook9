  <title>A Dragon&#39;s Journals - Matthew Flentje</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a small farming hamlet between two kingdoms is completely destroyed, a king must choose carefully his next actions to avoid war.  When the other kingdom is populated completely by dragons, it only makes sense to send a dragon of their own to act as their diplomat, right?
Enter Ka&#39;kivanwyn, draconic pet of the prince and a selfish, spoiled brat.  Having never been outside the castle walls and reluctant to do so, he is pressed into service to figure out what happened to the village.
Together with his friend the prince, his bodyguard, and a mysterious magi, they must embark on a simple quest to hopefully restore order to two kingdoms.
Unfortunately, their quest becomes anything but simple as they dig deep beyond the ruins of the destroyed town to find that something far worse lurks beyond the surface.  Soon they find themselves on the wrong end of fate as they struggle not only to continue their investigation but also avoid the troubles that chase them.  Can Ka keep his composure long enough, or will his selfish nature get the better of an entire kingdom?" />
