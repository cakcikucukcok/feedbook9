  <title>The Skeleton Leaf Stories - Jane Boatwright-Cook, Bill Shurtliff, Janet Shurtliff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we last left Olivia she had just discovered that her winged necklace was an exact match to the mysterious carvings in the shutters of her home. When Olivia held up the necklace to show both Music and Ralph how the gold wing matched the carvings, the shutters shook and then suddenly came loose, carrying Olivia off.
After twirling and twisting through a spinning tunnel, she landed on her feet in front of an elf named Darius, an Elder of Fifty-Fifty Land, a place where Chosen Ones go for a day or two to be taught helpful lessons about how to be a Chosen One. Olivia partners with an elfin girl named Willa who helps Olivia to understand her true calling and the importance of being a Chosen One.
Meanwhile the Evil Vole King Teivel is making plans to attack the school with his huge army of evil minions. He wants to gain the land the school sits on so he can increase the size of his Kingdom of Evil in hopes of ruling all evil. Mischievous twin brothers Colin and Riley McPatrick are students at the school who hear of the Evil Voles intentions and take it upon themselves to spy on the Voles in hopes of getting valuable information for the leaders of the school, but instead find themselves being captured.
Read as Olivia and Willa  helped by Olivias faithful dog Ralph, her charming cat Music, and her steadfast horse The General  take on the adventure of rescuing the McPatrick boys." />
