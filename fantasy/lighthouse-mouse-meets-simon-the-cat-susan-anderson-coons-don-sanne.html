  <title>Lighthouse Mouse Meets Simon the Cat - Susan Anderson Coons, Don Sanne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lighthouse Mouse meets Simon the Cat for the first time, grouchy tempers and furs fly. Simon could not believe his eyes as he watched pesky Lighthouse Mouse win Mollys friendship and take part of her attention. Simon was so mad that he wanted to eat that mouse right on the spot, and Simon knew that he could do it! Watching from between cushions, Lighthouse Mouse knew that he had to do something fast, or he would end up as a morsel on Simons plate. Mouse did the one thing he saw Molly do when she was in a tight spot. He prayed harder than he had ever prayed in his short mouse life.
As Mouse calmed down, he reasoned with Simon from between the pillows about why they should try something different. Anyone can be mean, Mouse told Simon, but it takes a bigger cat or mouse to get beyond fighting. Mouse suggested a crazy idea, which Simon finally accepted. Why not be friends and see how much they could help Molly? After all, didnt they both care for her?
What happened next saved Mouses life. It also led to friendship for this unlikely pair of Simon the Cat and Lighthouse Mouse. Learning to work as a team to help Molly, they discovered joys and fun in their unlikely friendship. Playing in harmony and helping Molly with lighthouse duties, they learned life lessons that children intuitively understand. Cooperation and faith are major skills that many children struggle to master. This childrens animal fantasy lays groundwork for faith, hope, and cooperation. When they make up their minds to do so, children can conquer challenges that might otherwise cause trouble and lead to misery.
As the second childrens book in a series, this is the follow-up to Independent Publishing Publishers award-winning book The Lighthouse Mouse. It is a whimsical book for children ages four to eight. For parents and teachers, it is a book for anyone wanting to share wholesome values with young children.
