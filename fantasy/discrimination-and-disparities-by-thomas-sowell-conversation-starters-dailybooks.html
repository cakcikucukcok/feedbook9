      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discrimination and Disparities: by Thomas Sowell | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Sowell&amp;rsquo;s bestselling book Discrimination and Disparities is his empirical examination of how the economic disparities and other disparities arise. Different outcomes like economic and others have a big difference depending on the individuals, their groups or their nations. Many explanations about the differences have been offered by many scholars and thinkers. Some of them say that those people who have less fortunate outcomes are the victims of genetics. Some others believe, however, that those who are less fortunate are actually victims of the more fortunate. In this book, Thomas Sowell gathers an extensive selection of empirical evidences to challenge this idea. Sowell proposes that different economic outcomes cannot be explained by one factor of any of these three: exploitation, discrimination or genetics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Washington Times praises Sowell&amp;rsquo;s book and describes it as &amp;quot;sane, balanced and highly informed discussion.&amp;quot; The Limbaugh Letter&amp;rsquo;s Rush Limbaugh says that Discrimination and Disparities is &amp;ldquo;timely...a must-read.&amp;quot; Power Line praises Dr. Thomas Sowell and says that everything he writes is worth reading. He continues to say that this book &amp;ldquo;couldn&amp;#39;t be more timely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
