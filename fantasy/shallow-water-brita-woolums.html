  <title>Shallow Water - Brita woolums</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of sixteen-year-old Janiese Macbrells crazy dreams has finally come to life, and she
realizes she has an important task at hand. She discovers that the seemingly ordinary Robert ORileya budding teenage geologistshares a part of her soul, and that soul could be in danger.&lt;p&gt;
In their dreams, the two teenagers meet and begin the adventure of their lives. They are aided by Rick Trigg, an independent photographer and self-professed dream traveler who finds the meaning in dreams and then tries to determine what will happen next. The trio must find a way to stop the spread of
a mysterious organism that has embedded
itself into Robbys body.&lt;p&gt;
Embarking on a wild journey along the Nile River, the group discovers how difficult it can be to travel the deserts and rainforests of eastern Africa. Living off of bananas and indigenous creatures, Janiese and Trigg battle the elements, following the maturity of Robbys soul. Janiese soon learns that she must make the crucial decision: Should she let Robby live? Or should he be left to die at the hands of an
unknown being?" />
