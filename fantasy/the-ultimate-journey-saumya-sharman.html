      <meta name="description" content="Why did five people run straight into a wall? Did you say because they couldn&#39;t see where they were going? Sorry, but its just the opposite. They knew exactly where they were going. They were going into the portal to save Karnithica. 
	After an exhausting and painful journey, Samm and her friends get to take a break from their first mission. Just when they get comfy and warm, a devastating event occurs. Back on the road to save Karnithica, Samm travels all over the country to make her second mission a success. With an evil king on a killing spree, friends turning to enemies, and enemies turning to friends, its a wonder they don&#39;t just give up. But they do have an advantage that no one else has. But will that be enough, or will they crash and burn before they even get a chance to fly?" />
