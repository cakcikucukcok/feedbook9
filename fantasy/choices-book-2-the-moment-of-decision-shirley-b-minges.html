  <title>Choices Book 2: the Moment of Decision - Shirley B. Minges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate and Sam Blake were the recipients of the essence of an
ancient civilization. Their tasks; return the essences to their
home world and prepare for a war that was prophesized in
the sixth century on Earth. Over time, when no war materialized,
they became convinced the prophesy was wrong and settled down
to relatively normal lives.
Kate has been kidnapped. She has been told the prophesy was not
wrong and that she is one of the keys to survival of four worlds.
Alacea is a key outpost in the coming conflict, but they are on the
verge of a civil war.
Her abductor is faced with a problem that must be resolved before
they arrive at Alacea. Kate has steadfastly rejected the source of the
gifts she has received and her own destiny. She must be convinced
to overcome the conflicts that plague her. Lives depend on it." />
