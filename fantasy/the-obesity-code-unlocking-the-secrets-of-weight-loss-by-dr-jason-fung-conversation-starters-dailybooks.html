&lt;br /&gt;
The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss is Dr. Jason&amp;rsquo;s Fung&amp;rsquo;s view on what really causes obesity, how it came to be such a prominent issue in society today, and what can be done to prevent it. Major topics within the book touch on hormonal shifts, insulin resistance, poverty, the food industry, diabetes, improving the diet, and fasting. According to Dr. Fung, insulin resistance is caused by hormonal shifts within the body, not by an increased number of calories within the diet. The science behind Fung&amp;rsquo;s theory is offered within every section of the book. The end of the book contains a special section offering a meal plan which revolves around periods of fasting. This book is today&amp;rsquo;s guide to losing weight and becoming healthier by adding periods of fasting to the diet.&lt;br /&gt;
