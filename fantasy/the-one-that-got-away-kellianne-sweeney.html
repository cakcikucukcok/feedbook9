  <title>The One That Got Away - Kellianne Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The One That Got Away
By Kellianne Sweeney
Everyone wonders about life after death. Most people tend to choose to believe in God, reincarnation, or the ghostly spirit world. Some choose something completely different. Others dont choose to believe that there is anything at all. It is, however, a powerful question and one that ordinary people and scholars alike have struggled to define and explain now and throughout history. The wondering and hoping are timeless. I believe that ultimately, we just wont know until we get there. This is a story. A story about how these beliefs could perhaps be connected. A story about a regular person given the opportunity to play with the big puzzle." />
