  <title>I Didn&#39;t Fly Over... I Landed in It - Wally Edmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unfortunately, Life in the Rubber Room is never to become second nature for Richard Ulysses Lion. His true fortunate nature, however, is that of being overly cocky, mischievous, and fun loving at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He weaves a wildly variable tale through the erratically woven pages of his personal journal. A journal that is chock-full of crazy adventures, and randomly filled with many unusual and off the wall incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is his Uncle Cletus who refers him to the State Mental Institution a.k.a. The Howard Hughes Hotel and who leaves him with these words &lt;br&gt;
&quot;It&#39;s a crazy world in there, Richard. Even though them folks in that place might know how to play crazy eights, believe me, none of them are playing with a full deck of cards.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Richard not only plays his cards right as he confronts the many hardships that come along with institutional life, he will also come to know, respect, and have a genuine concern for the folks who are living there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But as fate would have it Richard himself is dealt a bad hand through the onslaught of his many seizures to come. Richard&#39;s biological time clock is slowly ticking away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His story is not meant to be one of ridicule, belittlement, or making fun. Richard&#39;s story is meant only to capture and release the humorous side of human nature itself." />
