  <title>Kingdom&#39;s End - Charles D. Blanchard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The rats made their massive colony inside the ruins of an abandoned motion picture palace, where for thirty long dark years, the aged blind leader ruled over them. A beloved figure held in high regard, he ruled with patience understanding justice and love. The new ruler of the colony offered little patience towards his subjects, and his punishments were harsh. As he conspired with determination to reach the top, it was all in vain, as forces worked against him to remove him from power and end his wretchedness. KINGDOM&#39;S END is an extraordinary tale of courage and survival as seen through the eyes of the leading characters who are all rodents. This story is of their struggle to survive in an urban landscape where there is conflict at every turn and living in fear is part of their existence. The story reaches its harrowing climax when the colony must decide on life or death." />
