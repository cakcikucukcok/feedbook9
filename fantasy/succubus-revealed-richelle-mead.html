Like hell she is.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgina Kincaid has had an eternity to figure out the opposite sex, but sometimes they still surprise her. Take Seth Mortensen. The man has risked his soul to become Georgina&#39;s boyfriend. Still, with Lucifer for a boss, Georgina can&#39;t just hang up her killer heels and settle down to domestic bliss.

Georgina is one of Hell&#39;s most valuable assets, but if there&#39;s any way out of the succubus business she plans to take it&amp;#8212;no matter how much roadkill she leaves behind.
