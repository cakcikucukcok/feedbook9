  <title>Flatlander - Oliver Kranichfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the year 2110 when a man awakens next to the Winooski River in Vermont with a severe case of amnesia. He soon encounters the acting leader of Vermont, King Henry, and his party, and is told that Vermont is now a fiercely independent republic and that he is a Flatlander, or one who is purportedly from the Old Country. The name sticks. But there is a problem: many Vermonters have a seething hatred for Flatlanders. Henry eventually agrees to offer Flatlander citizenship, but only under the condition that he successfully complete ten quests to better the overall Republic of Vermont. He reluctantly obliges to fulfill these quests, which are made even more difficult because of the prejudices against his kind. As Flatlander embarks on a journey full of strange yet endearing characters, creatures, and legends, a magical world is brought to life as he comes closer to discovering who he once was, while piecing together an entirely new identity. In this humorous fantasy adventure, cultures and customs collide within a medieval-like Vermont as Flatlander attempts to fulfill his ten assigned quests, uncover the mystery of his past, and find his place in the world. Included are 33 beautiful black and white illustrations by Sam Balling." />
