  <title>Sixteen - S. A. Jarrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kimi was very excited to turn sixteen; she really hoped it would mean change as she saw her life as pretty dull. Little did she know that, on the morning of her sixteenth birthday, she would wake up alone.
She was not only alone but was also in a world where everything looked the same apart from the fact that there were no other people, the weather was nondescript, and there was no sound. The only thing that seemed normal was when Kimi returned to her bedroom. When she looked out of the window, she was able to see all the comings and goings of a normal day, but why couldnt anyone see her?
Confused and alone, Kimi ended up in her best friend Claras house, where she finds out that a boy called Karl had exactly the same life as her. The bad news was that he was in a different country. The story developed as the two found a way to communicate but started to realize that very strange things were happening to them. Someone else was also trying to get in touch and had some life-changing information to share with them both." />
