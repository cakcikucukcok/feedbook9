&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;&quot;&gt;James Braden was an
ordinary twelve-year-old boy, except for one thing. He had a secret.
A big one. As a young child, James had slipped away from a family
outing and vanished into the forest. He reappeared three days later 
alone but unharmed, and miles from where he was last seen. Where had
he been? Who had helped him? James wouldn&#39;t say. He had promised to
say nothing about meeting the WindSinger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;&quot;&gt;	The WindSinger was a creature with the power to care for and heal all living things. She believed herself to be the last of her kind. Humans had been responsible for exterminating other members of her species, so she&#39;d been taught to fear them. Yet, in
the three days they spent together, she and James had made a connection that would cross time and space. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;&quot;&gt;	Nine years after
their first encounter, the WindSinger came back into James&#39;s life.
This time it was she who needed help. Conscious of the debt he owed
her, James willingly became her protector. But he didn&#39;t anticipate
the dangers he&#39;d face in returning to the forest with her. What
happened there would leave him with an even bigger secret. And it
would change his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
