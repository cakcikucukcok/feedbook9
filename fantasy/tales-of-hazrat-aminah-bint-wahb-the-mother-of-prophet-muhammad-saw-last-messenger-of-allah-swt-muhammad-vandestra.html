  <title>Tales of Hazrat Aminah bint Wahb The Mother of Prophet Muhammad SAW Last Messenger of Allah SWT - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Story of Hazrat Aminah bint Wahb The Mother of Prophet Muhammad SAW Last Messenger of Allah SWT (God) Based from The Noble Quran &amp;amp; Al-Hadith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The womb of Aaminah bint Wahb was certainly the noblest and the most honorable of all wombs because it was the womb that carried the seal of all the Prophets and the leader of the Messengers. It was in this womb that the noble fetus (Allah&amp;#39;s Messenger) settled. This seed had been passed down from the loins of men, generation after generation until Allah in His Divine wisdom decreed that it moved into &amp;#39;Abdullah ibn &amp;#39;Abdul Muttalib, the youthful Qurayshi who excelled his contemporaries in greatness. &amp;#39;Abdullah ibn &amp;#39;Abdul Muttalib was ransomed from slaughtering, after his father had vowed to sacrifice him and had sought to fulfill his vow. He was the most precious person the Arabs had ever known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was not slaughtered by Allah&amp;rsquo;s will, so that the Divine choice might be actualized and firmly rooted in the history of mankind, all bearing witness to Allah&amp;#39;s absolute Will. There is no change in His Words and there is no preventer against what He has decreed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Allah chose Adam, Nooh [Noah], the family of Ibraheem [Abraham] and the family of &amp;#39;Imraan above the &amp;lsquo;Aalameen [mankind and jinn]. Offspring, one of the other, and Allah is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.&amp;quot; (Qur&amp;#39;an 3: 33-34)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Abdullah went out with his father &amp;#39;Abdul-Muttalib after he had been saved from being sacrificed. A woman from Bani Asad ibn &amp;#39;Abdul &amp;#39;Uzza then saw him beside the Ka&amp;#39;bah and said to him, after having looked into his face,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You will be given the like of the camels that were sacrificed for your ransom if you cohabit with me now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is because she saw something special in him. &amp;#39;Abdullah replied that it was better for him to die rather than to commit an unlawful thing and that for a noble man to preserve his honor and religion was more worthy. &amp;#39;Abdul-Muttalib chose Aaminah bint Wahb of the Zuhr clan as a wife for his son &amp;#39;Abdullah. Aaminah was then the best Qurayshi woman in lineage and status.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A fortune-teller from Tibalah who was known as Fatimah bint Murr al-Khath&amp;#39;amiyah had also seen &amp;#39;Abdullah. This woman was one of the most beautiful and chast of Arab women. She saw the light of prophethood in the face of &amp;#39;Abdullah, she then offered herself in marriage to him but he rejected her offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The news of a Prophet that would come from the children of Ismaa&amp;#39;eel (peace be upon him), was spreading among the Arabs all over the peninsula. This news was based on what the people of the scripture had narrated and what they were informing from what was recorded in their Torah, both implicitly and explicitly. People were also finding this out from fortune-tellers and astrologers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though &amp;#39;Abdullah ibn &amp;#39;Abdul Muttalib was a handsome youth, possessing an amazing and lofty upbringing and even though he possessed chastity and high morals and young women had sought him and asked for his hands in marriage, Allah had decreed that Aaminah would be &amp;lsquo;Abdullah&amp;#39;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aminah was traumatized by the death of her beloved husband, who had only lived with her for a few months after their marriage. She wept bitterly and wailed severely as her fetus had already become an orphan before it had even been born. But she pushed herself to stay strong and persevere. She found consolation in &amp;#39;Abdul-Muttalib who took good care of her and showed her much compassion. Her pregnancy was surprisingly very comfortable and easy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In her dream one night someone came to her as she was sleeping and said to her,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are pregnant with the Leader and the Prophet of this Nation (Ummah).&amp;quot;" />
