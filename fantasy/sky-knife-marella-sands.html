  <title>Sky Knife - Marella Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sky Knife is a young man cursed with an unlucky name - a name his mother  saw in a vision and pledged that her son would bear, to honor whatever  destiny the gods had decreed. He hasn&#39;t the luck to take one of the  usual paths charted for his people: farmer, soldier, merchant - all  these roads are closed to him. The only hope for him lies in service at  the King&#39;s Temple, where - he hopes - the gods will make clear his  purpose in the world. But as a novice priest he has little hope of  fulfilling his destiny. That is, until a human sacrifice goes horribly  wrong, priests begin to die, and the skies fill with dangerous portents  and visions. Magic of all sorts seems to cling to Sky Knife like a  shroud, but if he is daring and lucky enough, he may just find out the  answer - and, in doing so, win a place among his people. Sky Knife is a  compelling and evocative portrait of ancient Mayan culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
