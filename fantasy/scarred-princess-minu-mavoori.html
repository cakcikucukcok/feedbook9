The Princess is protected by her mother who disowns her husband and goes into exile with the Princess. The Queen and the Princess are forced out of their exile when a war befalls their Kingdom. The Princess uses her power, when the enemy strikes her family. Destruction envelopes the enemies, but the loss of her family crushes her innocent heart. She promises never to return to her land and finds her way to Earth for shelter. She is later pursued by Prince Nothing (Nott) and is forced to return to her land to save her step sister, who was abducted for revenge. The path to save her sister greets them with another war." />
