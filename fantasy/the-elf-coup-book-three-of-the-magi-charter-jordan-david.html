      <meta name="description" content="About the series:&lt;br&gt;For over two thousand years the legend of Santa Claus has endured. His is a mission of peace as outlined in the Magi Charter, given to the first Santa by the Child. From humble beginnings following that First Christmas the Santa lineage has been passed down through the ages. This epic adventure tells the story of those Santas from the founding of the North Pole and the origin of the ancient elves, to our modern times where the world&amp;#39;s problems effect even those in the secluded complex of the North, and concluding in the distant future which finds Santa and the elves committed to their mission on a galactic scale where Christmas traditions are barely recognizable. Even in that era those committed to the Charter must find a way to deliver that which is needed most to those most deserving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Elf Coup:&lt;br&gt;It was foreseen that this would be a difficult year for the North Pole. Multiple crises threaten the complex as well as individual elves. Santa Claus is missing somewhere in the human world as are the elves sent to find him. The creature Krampus wreaks havoc on the North Pole bringing elf work to a halt. Mistletoe Green seizes the opportunity to carry out his own diabolical plans for power. The retired elves have their own secrets that will unlock more mysteries of the North Pole, vital for certain young elves which everything depends on. Noel alone must face Mistletoe, but first he will need to master the elfin runes and that means surviving the training of an ancient elf&amp;#39;s teachings..." />
