  <title>The Liberation of Folks Bell - Peyton Eli Bell Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Folks Bell , is an Astronomer who was content in life with just admiring the beauty and wonder of the far off cosmos. Raised in Philadelphia pa. by Dr. Sala C. Bright , a brilliant professor and archeologist who once worked in the top secrect research department at Area 51 for fifhteen years , who taught Folks everything he knew except for one dark secrect about his future. Folks is destined to save the world from the most diabolical scientist to ever walk the earth! Raul Testo , a once great scientist who felt that life cheated him , is now hell bent on destroying the earth with his &quot;Earthquake Machine&quot;. Folks is all of a sudden thrown into a race against time to stop Testo from his &quot;World destruction plan&quot;. Along the way Folks meets several allies who seem to already have a clear understanding of who and what Folks Bell and his destiny are. Folks , who was chosen by 24 elite human beings to save tha world was predestined to take on this mission , which very well may cause the destruction of his own life. Along the journey Folks stuggles to fight Testo every step of the way , while he learns more and more about his own destiny. The more Folks learns about his destiny , the more he is content to take on the mission! With help from Valhalla , a woman who is as dangerous as she is beautiful , and Zig-Zag , a former gang member , who seeks his own forgiveness in life. The three vow to stop Testo at any cost. Things heat up as Folks Bell wonders if the people who are helping him are the same people out to destroy him. With not knowing who to trust , Folks grows closer to Valhalla and Zig-Zag , who also have not been honest about who they are! Folks&#39; hatred for Testo grows at each terroristic act that Testo performs. Will Folks Bell perish in destruction? Will the people who claim to be true to him prove so? Will Raul Testo destroy the world with his &quot;Earthquake Machine&quot;? Will good prevail over evil , or will the tyranny of evil destroy the world , and all in it? With a ground shattering climax that ends in a Philadelphia skyscraper , who will be the victor?" />
