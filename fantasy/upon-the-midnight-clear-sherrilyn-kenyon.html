  <title>Upon The Midnight Clear - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ever think Scrooge had it right before the ghosts ruined his life? Meet Aidan O&#39;Conner.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;At one time he was a world-renowned celebrity who gave freely of himself and his money without wanting anything in return...until those around him took without asking. Now Aidan wants nothing of the world--or anyone who&#39;s a part of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a stranger appears at his doorstep, Aidan knows he&#39;s seen her before...in his dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born on Olympus as a goddess, Leta knows nothing of the human world. But a ruthless enemy has driven her from the world of dreams and into the home of the only man who can help her: Aidan. Her immortal powers are derived from human emotions--and his anger is just the fuel she needs to defend herself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One cold winter&#39;s night will change their lives forever...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped together in a brutal winter storm, Aidan and Leta must turn to the only power capable of saving them--or destroying them both: trust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
