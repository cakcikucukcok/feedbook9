  <title>Lord of Water Ii - Mike King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coming forward from Lord of Water, a precious water planet!
A one-million-year calibration was set to take place. The balance of this precious water planet was all perfectly held in place and monitored by a perfect white sapphire crystal embedded in the planets surface deep below the ocean.
With the prediction of one million years held in place by this perfect universal communication system, the task at hand for our Lord of Water was to simply locate the crystal and ensure that it would be clear and glowing as it had been for almost an eternity past.
But with the presence of dark and evil beings with their destructive intention closing in on the precious resources of this planet, the playful journey of our young lord has instantly turned to red.
A universal alarm has been sent out, but more threatening now is the destruction of this precious water planet with the forthcoming global evaporation.
Follow forward with this highly spirited team as they now are left with no choice other than to span the globe and seek to undo this force of unthinkable and evil power.
Let the journey begin." />
