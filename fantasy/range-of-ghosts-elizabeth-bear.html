  <title>Range of Ghosts - Elizabeth Bear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A powerful new fantasy from Hugo award-winning author Elizabeth Bear, &lt;i&gt;Range of Ghosts &lt;/i&gt;creates a world both deep and broad, where a sorcerer-prince seeks world domination for the glory of his God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temur, grandson of the Great Khan, is walking from a battlefield where he was left for dead. All around lie the fallen armies of his cousin and his brother who made war to rule the Khaganate. Temur is now the legitimate heir by blood to his grandfather&#39;s throne, but he is not the strongest. Going into exile is the only way to survive his ruthless cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once-Princess Samarkar is climbing the thousand steps of the Citadel of the Wizards of Tsarepheth. She was heir to the Rasan Empire until her father got a son on a new wife. Then she was sent to be the wife of a Prince in Song, but that marriage ended in battle and blood. Now she has renounced her worldly power to seek the magical power of the wizards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two will come together to stand against the hidden cult that has so carefully brought all the empires of the Celadon Highway to strife and civil war through guile and deceit and sorcerous power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Eternal Sky Trilogy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 Range of Ghosts&lt;br&gt;#2 Shattered Pillars&lt;br&gt;#3 Steles of the Sky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
