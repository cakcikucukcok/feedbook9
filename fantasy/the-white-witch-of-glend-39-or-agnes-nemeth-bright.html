  <title>The White Witch of Glend&#39;or - Agnes Nemeth Bright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Annis and Enryk are teenagers who live on a small island in a hidden corner of the Pacific Ocean. They are in love, and everyone hopes that they will be married one day.
&lt;p&gt;
The island was accidentally discovered by sailors hundreds of years before Annis and Enryk were born. Although the sailors did continue their journey home as planned, some of them were unable to forget such a beautiful and unspoiled place. They returned, taking their families and plenty of supplies with them.
&lt;p&gt;
During the long period of peace, Glend&#39;or has became more prosperous than the island&#39;s other kingdoms, Gregori&#39;a and G&#39;abari. Envious of the success, the king of G&#39;abari attacks Glend&#39;or. Enryk is mortally wounded in the ensuing battle.
&lt;p&gt;
Annis&#39; suffering forces her Aunt Elisabeth, the White Witch of Gregori&#39;a, into a very dangerous offer. Because Annis insists that she will never seek another relationship, Aunt Elisabeth suggests a way to reunite her with Enryk. If Annis becomes a witch, she will live longer than an ordinary human being and can wait for him. It is the firm belief of the island&#39;s white witches that someone who dies can reappear in human form. However, even a witch might die before the happy reunion could take place.
&lt;p&gt;
Annis convinces her aunt that she is ready to take this risk. She is also willing to live a life of service to the island&#39;s inhabitants, using her special powers and wisdom. So after a seven-year apprenticeship she becomes Nessa, the White Witch of Glend&#39;or. Thus begins the busy life of a new witch, filled with hope of a happy ending.
