  <title>The Maps of Seven and the Trinket of Iris - Eli Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no turning back now. The path has already begun to take young Klever to his destiny, and his twin sister Orri awaits him, for she will cross the veil soon. He must get to her before that late hour, for they must be beside each other or their connection will be lost and the serum will be useless. Klever must use the maps to trek to his destination with his loyal companions surrounding him, but the journey will challenge them all. Treachery sneaks upon them, and the night beckons them to give in and let the cunning one take what has never rightfully been hers. The night star of Enubis misguides them, and should they not watch their footing, they will all fall prey to her dastardly plans. The great white owl directs her young apprentice, for one day, perhaps soon, she will take up her seat in the new age. All of them must stay alert and ever on guard." />
