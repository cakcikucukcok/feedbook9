  <title>Mack Dunstan’S Inferno - Paul Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mack Max Dunstan has played Moses, Marc Anthony, Ben-Hur, President Andrew Jackson, and Long John Silver.  He has starred in The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, El Cid, 55 Days in Peking, Planet of the Apes, Omega Man, and Soylent Green, to name a few.  Sadly, in this age of social media, reality television, and political correctness, todays generation know him only for his hard right point of views and his outspoken nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack Dunstans Inferno was written as a satirical, fantasy work, where Mr. Dunstan succumbed to Alzheimers, went through the death process, and descended into hell, where he met victims of his pro-gun policy.  Collins was a fan of Mack Dunstan. This manuscript was actually inspired when the author viewed Michael Moore, who challenged Mr. Dunstan in Bowling for Columbine.  The author did not support Mr. Moores penchant for skewing the facts, or promoting his own agenda, but has acknowledged the filmmaker for providing the inspiration for Mack Dunstans Inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins was never a fan of filmmaker Michael Moore.  In fact he was utterly appalled and disgusted to hear how Mr. Moore accepted the academy award.  The American Academy awards were about Gucci shoes, who was wearing what, and who&#39;s sleeping with whom.  It was never about social issues. Collins never understood how a movie director could become infamous through documentary filmmaking. Only in America!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack Dunstans Inferno began with Mack Dunstan going through and experiencing the death process.  As he journeyed, he met Virgil, who guided him through hell, heaven, and eventual illumination.  In his journey, Mr. Dunstan met the many victims of his pro-gun policy.  Many were Hispanic and African-Americans, all of whom were from the poorer classes.  It was in this scenario of the underworld; Mr. Dunstan was confronted with the many sad and tragic stories, leaving him to go through the process of expurgation of guilt, anger, and elimination of the ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Dunstan, however, did meet a lot of celebrities in his journey of the underworld.  Some were from the silent era, golden age of cinema, and classic, American TV shows.  Mack Dunstans Inferno was not only a satire on those who enjoy distinction in the modern era, but a parity, or update, of The Divine Comedy.  Within in the perimeters of fiction, Collins satirized and the so-called pillars of the communities and media darlings.  He lampooned present actors, dead actors, present/past members of the political and business elite. Therefore, instead of mentioning long, dead ancient figures of history, Collins sketched in Kelsey Grammar, Sally Struthers, or JK Rowlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack Dunstans Inferno does not promote a dogmatic, Christian belief system, but an Eastern point of view.  Find out more by reading Mack Dunstans Inferno, where sci fi adventure fantasy and religious superstitions will collide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
