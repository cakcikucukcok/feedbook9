  <title>The Springfield Witch - Mandie O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are we sure shes a real witch? Ms. Robinson inquired.
Well, if she is, thats the most pathetic excuse for one I have ever seen, barked Mr. OGill. 
The residents of Springfield knew what a witch was, and it certainly wasnt anything like Agnes. She had come to their village to be their resident witch, and she had definitely been a disappointment. For years, Agnes lived in Springfield totally alone and unappreciated until Ned, a strange little boy with a fondness for books and vegetables, moved into the village. Agnes and Ned found they had a lot in common and struck up a friendship. However, the arrival of a beautiful new witch and the disappearance of some of the villagers threatened to ruin the happiness they had found.
The Springfield Witch is a magical and funny story about friendship, magic, witches, and vegetables." />
