  <title>The Animal in Man - Joseph Asphahani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maxan, a cunning fox, stalks the Leoran capital city of Crosswall as a “shadow”—a lone operative for the city guard who must never be seen or heard, and never engage with the enemy. But when he’s caught in an explosion that levels a city block, the fox ignores his mission and retrieves a dangerous artifact that could bring the whole planet of Herbridia to its knees: the relay, a weapon that turns civilized animals into savage beasts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Maxan must fight to keep the mysterious relay from falling into the hands of those who would abuse its power. There’s just one problem: he doesn’t know who to trust, or why he alone is immune to the deadliest weapon in the world. With Leora on the brink of a massive civil war, can Maxan find his allies in time to save animalkind from itself?" />
