          &lt;strong&gt;My father always said fear was a weakness. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well, that’s easy to say when you don’t have to worry about vampire slayers. In the two months since I was turned into a vampire, I’ve killed my evil sire, Cyrus, fallen in love with my new sire, Nathan, and have even got used to drinking blood. But now Nathan has become possessed and has slaughtered an innocent human.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s down to me to find Nathan before the Voluntary Vampire Extinction Movement does, because they’re just waiting for an excuse to terminate him – and anyone foolish enough to help him. But it gets worse: Nathan’s been possessed by one of the most powerful and wicked vampires alive – the Soul Eater. And who knows what vile plan he’s concocted?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the Soul Eater and my possessed sire on the loose, I have a lot to fear. Including being killed. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt; Love Sookie Stackhouse and Bella Swan? It’s time to meet newly turned vampire Carrie Ames.&lt;/em&gt;
