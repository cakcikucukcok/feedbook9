  <title>Visions Through a Shattered Lens - James Beaumont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you know what is real and what is not? Do you trust your mind enough to make the distinction? You might think you see the world clearly, but maybe theres nothing clear to see; maybe the world is, in fact, distorted, as illuminated in Visions through a Shattered Glass, thirty-one stories sure to make you question the everyday.
Within, there are tales of dreamers who see things like crypts and crying mothers, unsure of the images validity. There are mysterious women, one dressed all in black, who serve to lure and confound. There are women who protect, as well, even from something so silly as a spider. Yet, are any of these happenings tangible, or has reality crumbled for this bevy of ill-fated men and women?
Author James Beaumont weaves a tapestry of horror and fantasy. He rides a carousel of contrasting moods, sometimes fantastic, other times hauntingly nostalgic, but always unsettling and ominous. Are you prepared to step into this world of alternate reality where things that go bump in the night really do wait outside your door? Come inside and find out." />
