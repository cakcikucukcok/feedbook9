  <title>Old Country Surprises - Ken Saik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Mike Benneks ailing grandfather asks him to take time off from work for a research holiday to the Ukraine, Mike eagerly accepts. He looks forward to connecting with his familys past; along with his brothers and a few friends, he embarks on the vacation of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment they arrive, the group becomes enchanted with the different culture surrounding them. Exotic new foods, architectural wonders, and the language itself wrap them in the past. But Mike also realizes that, while the Ukrainian people have not forgotten their troubled past, today they are still being haunted by a harmful Russian influence. It is one more narrative he must add to his grandfathers story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike finds his grandfathers birthplace with the help of the beautiful, strong-willed Natasha. He hears stories from long ago and learns more about his family and their culture than either he or his grandfather thought possible. From traditional Easter eggs and the peasants disdain for the aristocracy to a benevolent nobleman who played a major role in his familys life, Mike comes to appreciate his grandfatherand his historymore than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With colorful details of the Ukraine and a dash of romance, &lt;i&gt;Old Country Surprises&lt;/i&gt; speaks to the importance of family and the bonds of loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
