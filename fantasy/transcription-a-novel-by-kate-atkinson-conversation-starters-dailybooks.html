&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1940s, women clandestinely worked to transcribe five thousand recordings every week at the BBC&amp;#39;s basement rooms. Juliet Armstrong was one of them. In 1950, when she achieves the position of BBC producer, she sees Godfrey Toby, otherwise known as John Hazeldine, with whom she worked within an operation during the war. Toby pretended to be a Nazi agent and Juliet assisted him by transcribing the chatter and gossip that were recorded as Toby socialized with the Germans. Juliet&amp;#39;s past war involvement implicates her in a horrifying event that remains undisclosed. She gets anonymous letters warning of revenge even as she is forced to help provide secret housing for people escaping Russia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Transcription: A Novel is written by Kate Atkinson who is the bestselling author of Life After Life.&lt;br /&gt;
