  <title>Fairy Tales Written By Rabbits - Mary A Parker, Michelle Cannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a bushfire separates them from their warren, two rabbits must journey through an abandoned suburban landscape in search of a unicorn to guide them home.Rabbits have told stories since the sky dust fell. Heath and his sister Millet are young rabbits struggling with questions that their ancestors never thought to ask.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a bushfire ravages the warren, Heath and Millet find themselves suddenly isolated in a new land. Other animals are asking questions about the dust, and the unknowable race known as They. Lost in an unfamiliar landscape the rabbits must work with the other inhabitants of this land, which are not all that they seem.&amp;nbsp;The enigmatic Stares-at-moon reads books, and claims to have seen the unicorn of legend that can guide them home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But they must be brave. Hidden dangers lurk in the abandoned homes of the They, and the traditional rabbit tactic of simply running will not be adequate. They must adapt and become something more than rabbits if they are to survive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A charming animal fantasy novel that will appeal to ages 8 and up with an illustration for each chapter that will appeal to animal lovers of all ages. Proceeds go to supporting the Big Ears Animal Sanctuary in Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;" />
