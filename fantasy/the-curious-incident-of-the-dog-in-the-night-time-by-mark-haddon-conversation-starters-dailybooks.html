&lt;br /&gt;
In the fast-paced city of New York, Jim and Bob Burgess have carved a new world for themselves far from the childhood ghosts created among the Maine countryside. &amp;nbsp;Bob works in Legal Aide, while Jim is an up-and-coming successful lawyer bordering on the edge of an eccentric reputation. A panicked call from home sends both brothers rushing to the side of their sister, Susan, and home to Maine. Susan&amp;rsquo;s son has been arrested for rolling a bloody pig&amp;rsquo;s head, during worship hours, into a Mosque inhabited by Somali refugees and the police are considering this a hate crime. Together, they will fight this battle as well as come to terms with lingering heartache and unanswered questions.&lt;br /&gt;
The Burgess Boys by Elizabeth Strout is simply one of her major accomplishments. The Burgess Boys was released in March of 2013 by Random House LLC and had immediate sales. The Burgess Boys was called &amp;ldquo;fluid and compassionate&amp;rdquo; in a review by the New York Times Sunday Book. Strout&amp;rsquo;s other writings are also highly regarded in the literary world, and she has received a Pulitzer Prize for Olive Kitteridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;emsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;bull; Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;bull; Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
