  <title>The Psychotic Preschoolers - Thomas D Bryson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Its been said there are no guarantees in life. Heres a guarantee you can bank on: Open this book and youll see that youve never met preschoolers like theseinimitable, wholly unique, and quirky, each with a distinctive agenda and way of looking at the world. These interconnected stories are full of whimsy and heart and color. They show us that our differences, rather than keeping us apart, should bind us together. Whether you relate to the beleaguered teacher or harried principal or to any one of the dazzling array of winning tots themselves (or a bit of all of them!), youre sure to laugh out loud while reading. At the books core, youll discover the power of creativity, the strength of imagination, the audacity of wishes, the excitement of synthesis, and the breathtaking potential of our minds. With unforgettable and vividly-drawn characters like Clarice (and the Odor Police), Jack (and the Intolerable Yak), and Abby (and the Bit Too Grabby), theres something for everyone, of all temperaments and ages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Psychotic Preschoolers is perfect as a collection of read-aloud bedtime stories for kids or as a fun way for adults to de-stress after another day in the grind. Whether you savor each charmingly rhymed and cleverly-conceived story on an individual basis, or plunge into them all and appreciate the breadth and scope of the entire book, youll come away with new admiration for and insight into the child mind, a mind that is not inferior to the adult version in any way, and actually, possesses a special clarity all its own. It is that sparkling specialness that the author has captured in these pages. And no matter how grumpy your day may have made you, you cant help but smile when you powwow with these preschoolers guaranteed! &lt;/P&gt;" />
