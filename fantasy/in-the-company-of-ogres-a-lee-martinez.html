  <title>In the Company of Ogres - A. Lee Martinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An uproarious new novel in the tradition of Robert Asprin and Terry Pratchett!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who&#39;s immortal, Never Dead Ned manages to die with alarming frequency--he just has the annoying habit of rising from the grave. But this soldier might be better dead than face his latest assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ogre Company is the legion&#39;s dumping ground--a motley, undisciplined group of monsters whose leaders tend to die under somewhat questionable circumstances. That&#39;s where Ned&#39;s rather unique talents come in. As Ogre Company&#39;s newly appointed commander, Ned finds himself in charge of such fine examples of military prowess as a moonstruck Amazon, a very big (and very polite) two-headed ogre, a seductively scaly siren, a blind oracle who can hear (and smell) the future, a suicidal goblin daredevil pilot, a walking tree with a chip on its shoulder, and a suspiciously goblinesque orc.&lt;br&gt;Ned has only six months to whip the Ogre Company into shape or face an even more hideous assignment, but that&#39;s not the worst of his problems. Because now that Ned has found out &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; he keeps returning from dead, he has to do everything he can to stay alive. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Company of Ogres&lt;/i&gt; does for fantasy, what A. Lee Martinez&#39;s previous novel, &lt;i&gt;Gil&#39;s All Fright Diner&lt;/i&gt;, did for horror--and elves and goblins may never be the same!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
