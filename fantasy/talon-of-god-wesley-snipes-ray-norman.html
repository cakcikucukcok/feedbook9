  <title>Talon of God - Wesley Snipes, Ray Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The acclaimed actor makes his fiction debut with this enthralling urban fantasy in which a holy warrior must convince a doctor with no faith to help stop a powerful demon and his minions from succeeding in creating hell on earth&amp;#8212;a thrilling adventure of science and faith, good and evil, damnation and salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that everyone you have ever known or loved was forced against their will into a state of demonic possession and spiritual slavery. Imagine an unholy cabal of the world&amp;#8217;s richest and most powerful men directing this sinister plan in order to cement their unbridled control of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine two heroes emerging from that darkness to do battle with the forces of evil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the mean streets of Chicago, &lt;em&gt;Talon of God&lt;/em&gt; is the action-packed adventure centered around the Lauryn Jefferson, a beautiful young doctor who is dragged into a seemingly impossible battle against the invisible forces of Satan&amp;#8217;s army and their human agents that are bent on enslaving humanity in a mission to establish the kingdom of hell on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lauryn is a skeptic, and it&amp;#8217;s only as she sees a diabolical drug sweep her city and begins to train in the ways of a spirit warrior by the legendary man of God, Talon Hunter, that she discovers her true nature and inner strength. Facing dangerous trials and tests, it&amp;#8217;s a true baptism by fire. And if they fail, millions could die. And rivers of blood would flow throughout the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine such horror. Such pain. And imagine what it would take to fight against it. For only the strongest and most faithful will survive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get ready. Armageddon approaches quickly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
