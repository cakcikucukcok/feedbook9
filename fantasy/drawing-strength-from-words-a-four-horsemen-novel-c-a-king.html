  <title>Drawing Strength from Words: A Four Horsemen Novel - C. A. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet the four horsemen: Michael, Gabrielle, Uriel and Raphael.
For centuries their sole purpose has been guarding the sealed gates to hell. Without keys, there was never any real threat. That was about to change...
For Gabrielle, protecting mankind was merely a job for which she received little credit. The vast insecurities of men altered history itself, portraying her as a masculine brute. Taking a back seat to her brothers seemed the right thing to do, but left a bitter taste in her mouth and an impenetrable barricade shielding her heart. 
Ryder bounced around the system from the moment both his parents were killed. Between that and run-ins with the law for crimes he never committed, it seemed the whole world was conspiring against him. Never growing attached to anyone was rule number one: a rule he&#39;d never broken until a white-haired vixen, with blocks of ice on her shoulders, walked right into his life." />
