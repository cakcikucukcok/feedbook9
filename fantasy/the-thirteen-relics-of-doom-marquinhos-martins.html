  <title>The Thirteen Relics of Doom - Marquinhos Martins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The tale herein begins the journey of many strangers that come together, to fulfill the prophecies that will in time, lead them to find the thirteen relics that nearly destroyed the world centuries ago. Slanoth, the greatest paladin to have ever lived, is given his youth back by his god Cargon. This allows him to train Cestator a fallen son of the evil god Valclon, who has turned away from his life of evil. The barbarian Angion, and the young boy Creashaw realize that their way of life could be threatened. They try preventing this, but their efforts may only speed them towards that which they fear most. 
All of them find themselves thrown into a war that none are prepared for. It is a war that threatens all life, and could throw their world into darkness. During this war they face many dangers including a terrifying, soul stealing, demonic, and nearly unstoppable creature known as Skreal, whos only goal is to eradicate all existence. 
They each will have to face their own fears, and overcome their hatreds if they are ever going to win this war. Will this journey mean the beginning or the end of all life as they know it?" />
