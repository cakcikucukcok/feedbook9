      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a ghost on the loose&amp;#8212;and a fox in the henhouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, the Eternal Slumber Funeral Home put Chicken Teater in the ground. Now undertaker Emma Lee Raines is digging him back up. The whole scene is bad for business, especially with her granny running for mayor and a big festival setting up in town. But ever since Emma Lee started seeing ghosts, Chicken&amp;#39;s been pestering her to figure out who killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her handsome boyfriend, Sheriff Jack Henry Ross, busy getting new forensics on the old corpse, Emma Lee has time to look into her first suspect. Chicken&amp;#39;s widow may be a former Miss Kentucky, but the love of his life was another beauty queen: Lady Cluckington, his prize-winning hen. Was Mrs. Teater the jealous type? Chicken seems to think so. Something&amp;#39;s definitely rotten in Sleepy Hollow&amp;#8212;and Emma Lee just prays it&amp;#39;s not her luck.&lt;/p&gt;" />
