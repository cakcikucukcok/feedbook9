      <meta name="description" content="Eight years have passed since Lila Raspreno and Anderson Olm raided Banbury&#39;s compound to rescue Lila&#39;s adopted son, Nate. Eight years since they discovered Arlo, another one of Banbury&#39;s genetic experiments amid the chaos. Eight years since Lila and Andy became bound to one another. So many questions were answered, while others were left to fester. Including the future of SAPP; the School of the Advancement of Practical Psionics and Lila herself. Arlo Anderson Olm, the genetic and adopted son of Lila and Andy who has just turned 8, is experiencing violent dreams from those first few tumultuous months of his life as his powers intensify and can&#39;t be controlled. A new-comer, Billy, a young Psion of Korean descent, moves in with the already stressed Olm clan when Lila decides he needs specialized attention. Then there is Nate and his partner, Jonah, who is already disabled and suffers a devastating mental snap. It seems like everything is happening at once and Lila isn&#39;t sure how much more she can take." />
