  <title>Campfire Chronicles - Ann White Lombardi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ann White Lombardis literary endeavor, &lt;i&gt;Campfire Chronicles&lt;/i&gt;, follows the travels of Alva, a nearly two hundred and four year old woman, with her quest to return to the sparkling waters of her birth. Her harrowing and heartwarming journey with a small group of strangers, leads them into
the alien society of the future and plays a part in their destiny.&lt;p&gt;
With the premise that the more things change, the more things stay the same, this science-fiction fantasy is written with attentive descriptions that allow the reader to travel along on the journey.&lt;p&gt;
There was a silence in the air that felt crushing. Amidst the soundless circle were all of the faint yet distinct noises; the bird in the bushes hopping from
twig to twig, the sound of a small animal scurrying through the dried grasses, the babbling of the nearby brook as the cold, fresh water tumbled over the smooth stones, the sound of tree toads singing in the distant swamp, and the crackling of wood in the fire pit as the flames came to life. All of these sounds set the stage for the evenings storyteller, Alva." />
