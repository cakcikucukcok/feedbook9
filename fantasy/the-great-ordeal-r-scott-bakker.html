  <title>The Great Ordeal - R. Scott Bakker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Praised by fans and critics worldwide, R. Scott Bakker has  become one of the most celebrated voices in fantasy literature. With The Great Ordeal, Bakker presents the  long-anticipated third volume of The Aspect-Emperor, a series that stands with  the finest in the genre for its grandiose scope, rich detail, and thrilling  story.    Â     As Fanim war-drums beat just outside the city, the Empress Anasûrimbor Esmenet searches  frantically throughout the palace for her missing son Kelmomas. Meanwhile and  many miles away, Esmenet&#39;s husband&#39;s Great Ordeal continues its epic march  further north. But in light of dwindling supplies, the Aspect-Emperor&#39;s  decision to allow his men to consume the flesh of fallen Sranc could have  consequences even He couldn&#39;t have foreseen. And, deep in Ishuäl, the wizard Achamian grapples with his  fear that his unspeakably long journey might be ending in emptiness, no closer  to the truth than when he set out.     Â     The Aspect-Emperor series follows Bakker&#39;s Prince of Nothing  saga, returning to the same world twenty years later. The Great Ordeal follows The  Judging Eye and The White-Luck  Warrior, and delivers the first half of the conclusion to this epic story.  Returning to Bakker&#39;s richly imagined universe of myth, violence, and sorcery,  The Aspect-Emperor continues to set the bar for the fantasy genre, reaching new  heights of intricacy and meaning.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
