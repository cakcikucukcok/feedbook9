He lives in a tiny apartment, goes to college, and perpetually spends most of his time in a local coffee shop. Despite this veil of normalcy, Matt has another identity, another name. That name, is Hades. Matt and his brothers have stood guard for millennia, protecting the human world from the demonic armies that threaten to engulf it. However, Matt must now stand alone against an enemy from the past that threatens those he holds dear. To protect his present, Matt must face his past and stand against the witch queen." />
