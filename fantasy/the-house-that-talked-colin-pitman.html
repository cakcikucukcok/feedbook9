  <title>The House That Talked - Colin Pitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cupboards can be naturally secret places. They are often dark and mysterious and can seem quite threatening, especially if you have a fear of the dark. Scott, if he could, would avoid going anywhere near the cupboard under the stairs in his house. It wasnt always easy for Scott to steer clear of visiting the cupboard. Every time he wanted to hang his coat up or put on his wellies, he had to open the door, and every time he opened the door, Scott could always hear that deep, sinister voice calling to him. What the cupboard under the stairs had to say to Scott has led to yet another adventure in the series The House That Talked. 
This is the latest of Scotts adventures, and the illustrations inside the book have been produced by another budding artist, Archie Bennett. Archie is a student in the county of Lincolnshire, and as a result of a storytelling workshop in his school, he won the opportunity to provide the illustrations for this particular book." />
