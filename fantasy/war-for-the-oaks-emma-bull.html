  <title>War for the Oaks - Emma Bull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed by critics and readers on its first publication in 1987, winner of the Locus Award for Best First Novel, Emma Bull&#39;s &lt;i&gt;War for the Oaks&lt;/i&gt; is one of the novels that has defined modern urban fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddi McCandry sings rock and roll. But her boyfriend just dumped her, her band just broke up, and life could hardly be worse. Then, walking home through downtown Minneapolis on a dark night, she finds herself drafted into an invisible war between the faerie folk. Now, more than her own survival is at risk--and her own preferences, musical and personal, are very much beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns tough and lyrical, fabulous and down-to-earth, &lt;i&gt;War for the Oaks&lt;/i&gt; is a fantasy novel that&#39;s as much about this world as about the other one. It&#39;s about real love and loyalty, about real music and musicians, about false glamour and true art. It will change the way you hear and see your own daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
