  <title>Adrushya Guru - Abc.Xyz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why am I here? Why was I born? Why do I have the life I have? 
Why do I have all the problems in this world? 
We have all asked ourselves these existential questions at some point of our lives, but have you ever thought of embarking on a journey to find your souls calling and true purpose of your life? 
Join an unlikely group of heart capturing characters brought together by chance (or was it through their perfectly planned destiny?) as they become passengers on a boat to do just that - find their souls calling and ultimate purpose of their lives. 
You will become enthralled in the details of their individual life experiences as well as the adventure of their collaborative mission to get back to her homeland a partially blind girl, who has, unbeknownst to her, been brought to India by human traffickers. 
Reading this book makes you feel as if you are right there with them: on the boat; feeling the inner conflict and all the varying emotions they each go through. 
Once you complete the book, the characters who became your companions during the time you spent with them, will linger in your heart and thoughts, as you find yourself wondering what they may be up to next!" />
