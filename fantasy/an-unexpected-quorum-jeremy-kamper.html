  <title>An Unexpected Quorum - Jeremy Kamper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jair is awakened from a bizarre dream by a familiar but chilling sound, it begins a series of unusual events that threaten the planning of his upcoming wedding to Terah. Refusing to let these strange occurrences alter their plans, Jair chooses to overlook them. But when Terah is kidnapped on their wedding night, the young husband can no longer ignore what is happening. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the help of his brothers and some new acquaintances, Jair sets out to recover his stolen bride. Each day brings greater adventure and mystery, as the band of men travel farther from home. They will encounter Cloaks and Sapients, large cities and ruthless rulers, and rare stones with curious markings. Each of these encounters will bring greater questions and few answers. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Who took Terah, why, and where is he going? What are the markings on the stones, and how are they connected? Why would a Cloak attack a group of undistinguished travelers like them? To Jair, these questions are important, but not as important as the one he continues to ask himself. Will he ever see his wife again? &lt;/p&gt;" />
