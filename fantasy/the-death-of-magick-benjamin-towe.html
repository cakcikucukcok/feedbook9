  <title>The Death of Magick - Benjamin Towe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Envision a naive young man beguiled, robbed, and ridiculed by a beautiful sorceress. Imagine the young man became the greatest assassin that ever lived. See in your mind&#39;s eye an assassin consumed by hatred of all things Magick and committed to their destruction. Visualize the creation- through the power of a Wish- of an artifact of great power to assist his quest. Picture the assassin&#39;s second Wish- a Wish for more time and a labyrinth to keep his treasure forever secure from any that might seek the artifact. Realize the consequences of the imperfect Wish- albeit difficult, a path to the assassin&#39;s treasure, the Death of Magick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Envision the struggle across space and time between a just and powerful sorceress with rainbow tresses and a demon of timeless evil. The sorceress must seek the weapon created to bring about her destruction.The strongest and wisest of two very different worlds attempt to unravel the mysteries of ancient parchments and devise a plan to defeat the demon threatening both worlds. A new generation of Donothor and Parallan- empowered by Light, Dark, and Illusory Magick- accepts the challenge and assists their king and mentors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What roles have a beautiful mysterious red-haired elf, the bloodline of an enemy, and an artifact of evil? Will the sacrifices of generations be for naught? If they find the Death of Magick, will the weapon destroy them before they face the demon?&lt;/p&gt;" />
