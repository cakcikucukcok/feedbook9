  <title>Harvesting - Lisa Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="‘Harvesting is shocking – and shockingly good. It is thought-provoking, anger-provoking, guilt-provoking, and – most importantly – it is a brilliantly written novel.’ – Roddy Doyle &amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
 Sometimes it feels as if three minutes has passed when it’s been three days, and three nights pass like a shiver of wind through the trees. I can’t tell shadows from bodies, voices from spirits. Luca’s face becomes an unknown man’s face, me under him, then the man’s face becomes Luca’s and I want to reach out and smash it . . .&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Sammy is a spiky, quick-witted and sharp teenager living in Dublin; Nico is a warm and conscientious girl from Moldova. When they are thrown together in a Dublin brothel in a horrific twist of fate, a peculiar and important bond is formed . . .&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
This is a novel about a flourishing but hidden world, thinly concealed beneath a veneer of normality. It’s about the failings of polite society, the cruelty that can exist in apparently homely surroundings, the bluster of youth and the often appalling weakness of adults.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Harvesting is heartbreaking and funny, gritty, raw and breathtakingly beautiful, where redemption is found in friendship and unexpected acts of kindness.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Harvesting was inspired by Harding’s involvement with a campaign against sex trafficking run by the Children’s Rights Alliance. Although it is a fictionalised account, the text has been read and approved of by representatives for NGOs in both Moldova and Dublin." />
