  <title>Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging by Sebastian Junger | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging&amp;nbsp;by Sebastian Junger | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tribes are small groups of individuals who have a clearly defined purpose and understanding. Tribes were indispensable for human survival before but somehow it got lost in modern society. New York Times bestselling author Sebastian Junger argues that it still is significant to our psychological survival.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before the American Revolution, the English settlers were on constantly escaping the Indians. The Indians never did. The existence of tribal society has been around for hundreds of years and it pulls on Westerners. The reason is that deep in our evolutionary makeup, we are wired to live as a communal species. Sebastian Junger combines history, antropology and psychology in his book Tribe. He explores tribal societies and what we can learn from them about belonging, loyalty and the quest for meaning. Tribe explains why we are better and stronger together and how it can happen in today&amp;rsquo;s divided world. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New York Times bestselling author S. C. Gwynne praises Junger&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;clarity of his thought, the elegance of his prose, and the provocativeness of his chosen subject.&amp;rdquo; Bestselling author of Matterhorn Karl Marlantes says that everyone should read this book because if individuals make the changes Junger suggested in Tribe, &amp;ldquo;all of us would be happier and healthier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
