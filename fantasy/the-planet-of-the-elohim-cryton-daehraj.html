  <title>The Planet of the Elohim - Cryton Daehraj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jsons entire reality is about to change, whether he likes it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He discovers he can travel between worlds, and he awakens on a bizarre planet controlled by the tyrannical rule of the Temple Council. When he survives a drug-induced hallucination, he is given his mission by the mysterious Transcendentals. He is to save the planet of the Elohim from the machinations of the evil sorcerer Bel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Tmar, his achingly beautiful fantasy girl; Cton, an ancient, high-ranking wizard who renounces his position on the Council; and Tmer, a scientifically trained tech from the cityJson must unlock the mystery of why the Dome is failing and where the crucial power reserves have gone before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun recedes and darkness consumes the land. Working with the Councils consent, Json must merge with the planetary grid and stabilize the power fluctuations that are causing the Dome to collapse. But something goes horribly wrong, and he becomes trapped within the grid. Tmar, realizing her love for Json, casts a heretical spell to retrieve his lost life forceand they both must now face unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Cton, they barely escape the clutches of the corrupt Temple Council. Now they must journey outside the Dome through the toxic environment of the Wastelands, to make their stand at the castle of the great sorcerer Bel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
