  <title>Born with a Curse - Danie Baly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people call it a gift, some call it being a player, and
some might even say that Im lucky. Some believes I
develop the skills of heated and wanted desires. Many
dont see the pain and the destruction this so call gift causes.
Yes! It feels good at fi rst, the pleasure of another company.
The thrill of the chase trying to seduce and manipulate the
human mind and body, at fi rst you get emptiness in the pit
of your stomach that starves for the hunger to feed the inner
passion. I call this gift a curse, it feeds off of devoured hearts,
hearts that cry for the need to be wanted and needed, hearts
that crave to be touched by the succulent desire of passion.
This curse has cause many tears within a broken heart,
plunging its kiss of death upon their lips, causing the body
to shut down only responding to the anticipation of being
explored." />
