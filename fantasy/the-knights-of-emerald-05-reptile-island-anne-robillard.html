  <title>The Knights of Emerald 05 : Reptile Island - Anne Robillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Knights of Emerald: This epic tale takes place in a forgotten world in a time of great unrest as Amecareth, the Dark Lord of the Insect People, attempts to take over the known universe. It is the story of Kira, the purple child, born of the rape of Queen Fan of Shola by the despicable Emperor, who will ultimately bring about his downfall, and of the brave Knights of Emerald entrusted with her safety.
Book 5 of the saga The Knights of Emerald, Reptile Island: With their courage and fairness to guide them, the Knights of Emerald rush to the aid of the women and young girls abducted in the Kingdom of Crystal by lizards-like creatures.
Wellan takes with him only some of his men, leaving the rest in Zenor. The chosen Knights embark on this perilous mission with the Crystal Magician who has a few surprises in store for them.
Meanwhile, in the badly damaged Castle of Zenor, Dempsey who is in charge of the Knights and the Squires faces another sorcerer of the Dark Emperor, even crueler than Asbeth.
Wellan having forbidden his soldiers to communicate with him while he is infiltrating the island of the reptiles, Dempsey and his brothers-in-arms will have to handle this new enemy by themselves." />
