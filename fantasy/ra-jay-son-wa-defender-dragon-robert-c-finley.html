      <meta name="description" content="For this adventure, **** [the young hero that YOU must name], will leave his beloved valley to help his friend realize his dream of being a Captain of a sea going vessel.  At the last minute Sinksalot needs a cabin boy for his voyage to trade, buy, and sell goods.  **** excitedly signs up but has no idea how much this voyage will change him.  Blistered hands, on board intrigue, wicked storm, duty as a lookout are but a few life changing situations.  Then there is bad news when the ship is smashed on the rocks, and he is forced to try and save an entire town by facing  The Black Dragons of Voractovia.  There is only one way to be rid of these demon beasts.  The golden/orange/red RA-JAY-SON-WA has saved the village long ago, but how can they get him to help now.  If the defender dragon cannot be found, then all, and I mean ALL, hope is lost." />
