&lt;br /&gt;
Things That Matter, by Charles Krauthammer, contains the best of Krauthammer&amp;rsquo;s articles that he has written about politics and government. Filled to the brim with wit, intelligence and erudition, readers can finally have all of his works gathered in one book. Included with his articles are his musings on everything from Woody Allen to Halley&amp;rsquo;s Comet to give light comedy amongst his passionate essays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Krauthammer is a winner of the Pulitzer Prize as well as a celebrated columnist. His column can be read in over four hundred newspapers across the world. Things That Matter was an instant New York Times Bestseller and is touted for its brilliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
