  <title>How to Talk so Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7 by Joanna Faber | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;How to Talk so Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7 by&amp;nbsp;Joanna Faber&amp;nbsp;| Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parents often ask what to do with a kid who won&amp;#39;t brush her teeth, who avoids his vegetables, who screams out what she wants. Or how to deal with the kid who goes overeager in exploring the supermarket, who disarranges books in the library, or who treats the baby as a toy doll. Small children are truculent, ferocious, foolhardy, self-centered, and semi-civilized, but they become sources of endless enjoyment for parents and caregivers once they learn how to communicate with them. Written as a user-friendly guide for people who are challenged by their small wards, the book helps them forge rewarding relationships with kids.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
How to Talk so Little Kids Will Listen is cited by Work and Family Life magazine as a &amp;quot;wonderful...reader-friendly [and] a truly indispensable book for parents.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
