  <title>David and the Wizard - Barrington G. A. Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story takes place on a remote island, named JA.  It is about a young boy, named David, and his vivid imagination as you will see.  No matter what he is doing or where he is his imagination always take over.  I tell you, one moment he is talking to a tree to get directions, and the next he is saving two dragons from doom.  He even has time to be a superhero, who save-the-day.  There isnt anything beyond his imagination.  So, where does the Wizard come in, well he lives deep in the forest of this island.  He helps David deal with his life.  He does this by the use of his magic and of course the animal kingdom.  Once a week David goes to visit the Wizard, and tells him of what might be bothering him or on his mind.  The Wizard, sits, listens, and comes up with ways to help David.  Together they solve Davids problem.  Oh, by the way, the Wizards name is Diyah, and what David does not know, is he has a secret, and David is going to help him with it." />
