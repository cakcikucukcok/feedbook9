  <title>Writer’S Block - Ankita Kapoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writers Block is a story of obstacles faced by a young girl who is as bitchy as her brains could allow but her traditional publication couldnt let. She is sensitive, hardworking, and intelligent far beyond her small town standards and has potential to charm you with her PhD in excellence per se in bitchiness.
Aarohi has just switched her job. From being a talented vibrant arts coordinator in a metropolitan city, New Delhi, to an insecure journalist with a multinational publishing conglomerate, Trenden &amp; Colters print media The Facts at her small town Lucknow, Aarohi is up for another start. The Facts brand value not only promises Aarohi big exposure but also big bucks. Set in the deepest shallowness of media industry, Aarohi begins her journey with bated breath and experiences that she had never known. From being published as a lead feature article writer to meeting popular Bollywood celebrities, Aarohi had her time at The Facts scooping out the most weirdest and honest stories of all time. But her joyful journey couldnt last long, for she soon discovers that her editor, Mala Ahuja had cheated her into working as a fulltime employee without a salary or position of a bona fide journalist. 
Would she endure this harassment without a noise? Or do you think the anger in her will cast spell at Mala? This employee boss war story will make you stand face to face with those vivid and unavoidable truths of life that boss may always be right but persistent bitching and tenacity to ones goal can take you anywhere. 
Find out how Aarohi finds out ways to get even with her evil boss, Mala Ahuja. Know how she masters the art of transforming her professional setbacks into bitching par excellence while having found out an exclusive Bitching Club which over a period of time becomes the quintessential space for all kinds of emotional, intellectual and psychological maturation. 
However as it happens every day in every small and big world, a big fish eats the small fish. Aarohi resurfaces to rise again but at the cost of something big. Do you think she would be ready for a second inning or would she succumb to pressures of a typical Indian arranged marriage whilst a new Aarohi stands between her. Find out." />
