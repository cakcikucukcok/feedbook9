  <title>Dragon Guard: Blood Dragon, Book 3 (Vampire Dragon Shifter Romance) - Mac Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The shadow world of the paranormal goes looking for Sarah Rennelle as she finds herself caught up in a cat-and-mouse game with dragons, vampires, and an annoying demigod.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Normalcy is invaded by Avery, one of her former students with a penchant for trouble. This time, however, he&amp;rsquo;s gotten himself in a little too deep and needs her help, or rather, he needs Adam&amp;rsquo;s help. Blackmail comes into play and Sarah is forced to drag Adam and the others into the mess as they find themselves facing off against two new enemies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They want Avery, but a series of mistakes leads them to show interest in Sarah. It&amp;rsquo;s an unhealthy interest in her that leads her away from her companions, and leads Adam into desperation as he tries to find her. All the while Sarah has a feeling something isn&amp;rsquo;t quite right between Adam and her. Like so many people around her there&amp;#39;s something he&amp;rsquo;s not telling her, and she aims to find out what it is even if it kills her." />
