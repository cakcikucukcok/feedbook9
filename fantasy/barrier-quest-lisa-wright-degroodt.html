  <title>Barrier Quest - Lisa Wright DeGroodt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Quests continue  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Harm is just trying to figure out his life after
college when he returns home to clear out his childhood
home. What he finds are more questions about his birth and
adoption. Seeking answers, he stumbles onto the Protectors
of the Land, who are quickly convinced Ben is the next
person destined to travel to the Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite balking at the concept of Interdimensional travel,
Ben finds himself in the Land on a desperate quest to find
the kidnapped Griffin cub. Going on a fantastical sea
voyage to the mystical Barrier, Ben learns the value of
nurture versus nature, destiny versus existing. His trek will
bring him knowledge about his heritage, his unique
capabilities and his impact on the Land. Join Ben as he
embarks on a journey that will take him to the ends of the
Land, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;" />
