          &lt;strong&gt;Can he get past betrayal?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Allison Hathoway&#39;s life was about healing. And she was good at it. Or had been good at it until the tragedy in South America. Now she couldn&#39;t even fix herself. She didn&#39;t know how to go on, didn&#39;t know what to do, or who to be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She had that in common with Gene Nelson. After the rancher found out the truth about his father, he&#39;d realized his whole life was a lie. He&#39;d gone a little wild, and saw no reason not to give in to his every desire. And the minute he saw Allison, he wanted her. But underneath their explosive passion, Allison and Gene found comfort in each other&#39;s wounded souls. And a chance to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
