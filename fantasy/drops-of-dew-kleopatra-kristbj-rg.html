  <title>Drops of Dew - Kleopatra Kristbjörg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My life in a thousand years.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye, see you in the next life! Thats what they somtimes put in words. But do they know who sometime say these words, that these words are true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book it tells the destiny of the same woman when experiences life after life. The soul preserves its experience from previous lifes and looks up those who related to ther soul before, for good or evil. But its all without conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people take up meditation to experience their past lives; others sometimes experience them through hypnotism, but I dream about them. Often they come to me in bits, and then I have to piece them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who enter their past lives often recognize the people there as the people who are with them in this life, friends or relatives, even if they look different or are of a different nationality. That is how it works with me. I know the people that I have seen in past lives, although, of course, I do not know them all and some I have yet to get to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get to know new people, I can tell whether I have known them before in a past life or lives. I feel like I know some of them and not others, and I only connect with the people that I know, that is, those that I have known in a past life. Some people I know in and out and trust completely, even though I have never seen them before. I have often thought about how peculiar this is and wondered about it, but I got an explanation when I experienced my past lives and recognized people there that I feel connected to in this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to keep a record of these dreams, write them down in books, and last autumn, I started to make a story out of them. Fact or fiction? I do not know, but all I can say is this: These are my past lives. Mine and the other peoples who appear in the stories and they are the same people who are with me today, although not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sleep, I return to the past, to the olden days, and I meet myself and others whom I know today. I see the course of my life, and that of others, throughout many lives and I understand various things that were previously a mystery to me. For example, why am I interested in this? Why do I like him even though I cannot stand him, or more to the point, even though I should not be able to stand him? Why do I dislike this woman even though I do not know her? Why is a certain woman such a good friend of mine even though she has so many character traits that I would not tolerate in others? Why can I not eat meat? Why am I so terrified of spiders? Why am I so terrified of fire?ved many lives and this book contains only two of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
