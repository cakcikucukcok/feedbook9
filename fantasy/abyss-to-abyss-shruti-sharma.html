  <title>Abyss to Abyss - Shruti Sharma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ria Mahi Patel had always been a vibrant and vivacious girl. She grew up in India in a very loving family. Ever since she was a young girl, she had recurring dreams of a young man. She did not know who he was and why she had those dreams. But every time she saw him in her dream, she felt like she was coming home. It was always comforting. That dream always left a warm, fuzzy feeling in her heart. Before she could decode her dreams, things changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ria got married. She moved to another country with her husband, Jay Sood Mattu. It was an arranged marriage, and after years of domestic abuse, Ria decided to break the paradigms and took control of her life. She was determined to change her life for good. Ria envisioned a bold plan and embarked on a journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, she still had recurring dreams of that man whom she hadnt met in real life. Was the universe trying to tell her something? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time passed by, more people came in her life, and her experiences grew. Ria began connecting the dots, and a whole new picture was revealed to her by the sequence of events. Something that she had never wrapped her head around became the reality of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a story that will surprise you, make you cry, play with your imagination, give you a giddy feeling in your stomach, put a smile on your face, inspire you, and leave you with hope and a profoundly uplifting message.&lt;/p&gt;" />
