&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, author Seth Abramson thinks that is likely that the Trump-Russia story will end with Americans choosing a new archetype for &amp;lsquo;American traitor&amp;rsquo; besides Benedict Arnold. He argues that proof of collusion is in plain sight and there is an almost historic absence of &amp;ldquo;any exculpatory evidence suggesting the president of the United States did not conspire with our enemies to violate federal law.&amp;rdquo; The book provides a full record of his investigation. Abramson, a former criminal investigator, a professor, and an attorney, uses his expertise to examine the case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Proof of Collusion is an Amazon #1 bestseller under the political intelligence category. It is written by Abramson who is considered by the Washington Post as a &amp;ldquo;virally popular&amp;rdquo; reporter of the Trump-Russia scandal.&lt;br /&gt;
