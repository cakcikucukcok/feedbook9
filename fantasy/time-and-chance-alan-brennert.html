      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A classic novel from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Moloka&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Honolulu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Before Alan Brennert became a bestselling author of historical novels, he wrote this lyrical fantasy in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife. &lt;/i&gt;Part love story, part deeply affecting character study, it is a literary tour de force chronicling the parallel lives of two men who were once the same man--until, as the poet Robert Frost wrote, &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood/And sorry I could not travel both/And be one traveler...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen years ago, Richard Cochrane left his small New England town to pursue his dreams of an acting career. But on some other level of reality there is also a Rick Cochrane, who chose instead to set aside his dreams, marry the woman he loved, and raise a family. Today, neither man is happy with the choice he made--but as their lives, once separated by time and chance, now draw closer together, Richard and Rick are offered another a last chance to discover &quot;the road not taken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time and Chance &lt;/i&gt;displays the same vivid sense of time and place--and the vibrant, memorable characters drawn with compassion, warmth, and humor--that have made the author&#39;s historical novels national bestsellers and reading group favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
