  <title>The Portal Prophecies: A Keeper&#39;s Destiny - C. A. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if the world as you know it wasn&#39;t the only world? What if all the creatures you have heard about in stories, did exist? The Portal Prophecies, tells the tales of an ancient race, sworn not only to protect all creation in different realms, but to keep them separate from each other as well. 
A Keeper&#39;s Destiny follows these ancient races, who have been forgotten over time and a young girl who is destined to break the rules. She was born in a world where nothing ever changes, or so everyone thought. Join them, as they combine together to try to beat the odds. When Willow and her friends find themselves in a race against time, can they over come the impossible? Follow our heroes as they wake up to another normal day, which then spirals into a speeding roller coaster of events, leading to the discovery of the secrets of their past and the conspiracies of their leaders. The Prophecies are the key to their salvation, but will they unravel them before an enemy invasion destroys their home?" />
