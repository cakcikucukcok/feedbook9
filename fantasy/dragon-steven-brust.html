It is both the second and fourth book of the series in chronological order, largely occurring after Taltos and before Yendi, with brief interludes taking place shortly after the events of Yendi.<br /><b><i>Dragon (Brust novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Dragon, by Steven Brust, is (as always) an exploration as to what makes up the house the book is titled after. Dragons, in the Taltos series, are military minded, follow their own honor codes, and believe nothing is better than obeying orders. They're essentially Klingons, but without the anger issues.<br /><b><i>Dragon (Vlad Taltos, #8) by Steven Brust</i></b> | Dragon [Steven Brust] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
