  <title>Daughter of the Spear - J. Michael Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two years ago Kiara was a young untried Battle Maid. In those days her goals were simple: become a battle-tested warrior and wed her foster-brother, Ciaran. Then the Goddess Danu gave Ciaran the quest to find the legendary Sunspear to keep it from falling into the hands of the Shadow. Kiara follows him and is set on a path binding her to a destiny not of her choosing. 
She soon learns that being a Psian capable of using the vast psionic powers of her inner mind is anything but simple. Her life and that of her beloved foster brother have changed drastically. Ciaran has become the Warrior of the Three Moons and she is the captive of the Dark Gods most powerful Ring Lord. She has to escape before he sets her Darksoul free her conscious mind, turning her into a servant of the Shadow. Her every action becomes focused on escape, but she is alone and surrounded by powerful men who plan to use her for their own dark purposes. One Ring Lord plans to Turn her to the Shadow and make her High Queen of the ireanni Celts. Another wants to use her as bait to draw Ciaran into a trap. A chance meeting with a Scythian Prince in the City of Kiriath sets him plotting to kidnap her and make her his concubine. 
Unable to use her psionic powers, she is forced to negotiate the treacherous waters of intrigue using only her wit and skills as a warrior. The conspiracies of mortal men, however, are not the only threat she must confront. The Gods of Shadow become aware of her and her relationship to the Warrior of the Three Moons and send deadly Shadowelf  assassins and Uruket Bloodwarriors to bring her to the Stone of Tears." />
