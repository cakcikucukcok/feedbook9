  <title>Midnight Amethyst - Linda Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Vellin. I have been commissioned by a power much greater than myself to be your guide through this adventure. Storyteller, I never considered myself to be, but I will do my best to bring you this tale of magic and majesty.
I am not the major player in this cycle, but to properly set the stage, you need to know a few bits about me. There are other places in this ebon void of ours than this amethyst and crystal shard upon which you abide in such bright beauty and boundless bounty. My shard broke into being the same time yours did, when the Dark Rebellion destroyed the crystal world the Elder Gods formed. My kind live a long time and I chose, after my family returned to the light and the air as we do when our lifepaths end, to travel. The Bright Goddess allowed me a wondrous blue orb, so soft and comfortable. I do admit to enjoying my comforts and I will confess to being spoiled. This lighted circle of transportation allowed me to visit several neighboring islands in this vastness in which we float. I traveled, observed, abided for a time. I thought, wrote, sang and learned. On your beautiful shard I found my bliss." />
