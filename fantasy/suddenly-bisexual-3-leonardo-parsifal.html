      <meta name="description" content="An overwhelming erotic gay romance full of passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carlo is a man in his thirties, married and who is trying to have a son with his wife. His life will change when he meets Roberto, a charming bartender who will tempt him more and more, giving rise to an overwhelming homosexual erotic passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;An erotic gay story that takes from the first page&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A gay book full of love and suspense&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sexual intrigue between out-of-the-ordinary and interesting characters&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Among the gay books I&amp;#39;ve read, it&amp;#39;s one that I liked the most, there&amp;#39;s a lot of romance in this school, unlike all the gay erotic novels where there&amp;#39;s only sex. protagonists is super exciting, in my opinion! Stuff that is not easily found in the free gay novels pdf on the internet! &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

gay love books, fantasy gay books, gay narrative books, romantic gay books, Italian gay books, outgoing gay books&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never read a gay novel like this, I adore the genre of gay romance novels books, but I&amp;#39;m generally snobby because there&amp;#39;s almost never gay love, just sex. I recommend it! A very powerful gay romance! &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;quot;Surely this&amp;quot; Suddenly bisexual &amp;quot;is among the gay pink romances I prefer. In general, erotic gay ebook, or gay romance novels are too vulgar, but this is erotic at the right point in my opinion. Very beautifull. I would categorize it between the narrative rose, because it presents important gay romance elements &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;quot;I had never read gay ebooks, nor romance romances of gay love, but I have to say that it took me so much, it&amp;#39;s exciting but not vulgar, with a bit of love and even a pinch of mm! gay novel that knows how to satisfy and is very addicting!&lt;br /&gt;
