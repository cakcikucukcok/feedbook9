Unbidden, she starts to have dreams and visions of a time with Christ, andthey become soreal that she crosses through time tofind herself weeping at hisfeetduringthecrucifixion. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;&quot;&gt;This is also a story about the Cathars in the Languedoc area of France. The Cathars embraced the idea of reincarnation.

In the process, their society was destroyed too as town after town was mercilessly razed by the crusaders andthousands put to death: men, women and children, none were spared. This became known as the first western genocide of Christian against Christian. Because of theCathars, the Church gave birth to the Inquisition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
