  <title>The Geomancer - Clay Griffith, Susan Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first Gareth and Adele Novel, The Geomancer is the start of an ongoing, character-based, urban fantasy series set in the same Vampire Empire universe as the authors&amp;rsquo; previous trilogy! The uneasy stalemate between vampires and humans is over. Adele and Gareth are bringing order to a free Britain, but bloody murders in London raise the specter that Adele&#39;s geomancy is failing and the vampires might return. A new power could tilt the balance back to the vampire clans. A deranged human called the Witchfinder has surfaced on the Continent, serving new vampire lords. This geomancer has found a way to make vampires immune to geomancy and intends to give his masters the ability to kill humans on a massive scale. The apocalyptic event in Edinburgh weakened Adele&#39;s geomantic abilities. If the Witchfinder can use geomancy against humanity, she may not have the power to stop him. If she can&#39;t, there is nowhere beyond his reach and no one he cannot kill. From a Britain struggling to rebuild to the vampire capital of Paris, from the heart of the Equatorian Empire to a vampire monastery in far-away Tibet, old friends and past enemies return. Unexpected allies and terrible new villains arise. Adele and Gareth fight side-by-side as always, but they can never be the same if they hope to survive. From the Trade Paperback edition." />
