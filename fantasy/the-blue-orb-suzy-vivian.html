  <title>The Blue Orb - Suzy Vivian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of years ago in the land of Uranallee, a powerful wizard creates a blue orb capable of amplifying directed thought with just a few words. It lies dormant for many years, until a coven of vile witches discovers it and develops a plot to take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zarcon is a great wizard who fears the witches have the legendary blue orb that provides them with more power the longer they possess it. One day after he hears someone riding toward his castle at a frantic pace, he opens the door to Jasmine, a young woman who has just stolen the orb and somehow escaped from the pack of wolves chasing her. After she enlists help from Zarcon to help her protect the artifact from the witches who will do anything to get it back, they must embark on a perilous journey to seek help from another. Will they succeed in their quest or will the witches catch them and once again obtain the orb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy story, a young woman and a great wizard set out on a journey to protect a powerful artifact from evil witches determined to keep it in their possession so they can rule the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
