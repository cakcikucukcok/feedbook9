  <title>Ephemeral and Fleeting - Patricia Reding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A lost freedom.&amp;nbsp;An ephemeral existence.&amp;nbsp;A profound mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mara and her charges, Reigna and Eden&amp;mdash;the ranking twin members of the first family of the Select&amp;mdash;discover the twins&amp;rsquo; unparalleled magic powers and then move to the palace of the Select at Shimeron, they return to the City of Light. There they train with the Oathtaker forces, preparing a response to the ongoing threat from Zarek, the evil leader of Chiran. But when a traitor in their midst discloses their plans to visit the realm&amp;rsquo;s border for a closer look, they are captured and imprisoned. Stripped of her Oathtaker&amp;rsquo;s blade, Mara soon discovers that an unknown power bars her ability to use her attendant magic to escape, or to free the twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mara&amp;rsquo;s magic dreams endeavor to inform her of events to transpire, as her cohorts labor to decipher ancient prophecy, as the twins learn of the power of a magic artifact they carry, and as Lucy struggles to uncover the traitor in their midst, Dixon&amp;rsquo;s rescue attempt takes shape. Meanwhile, Zarek&amp;rsquo;s son&amp;mdash;the twins&amp;rsquo; cousin, Broden&amp;mdash;seeks to assist his father&amp;rsquo;s prisoners. But before he can do so, Mara discovers that the loss of her charges is only one painful outcome that could come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escape is impossible; survival, questionable; loss, inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet . . . things are not always what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
