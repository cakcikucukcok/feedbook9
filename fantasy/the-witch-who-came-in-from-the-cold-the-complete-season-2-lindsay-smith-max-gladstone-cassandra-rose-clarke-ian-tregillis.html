  <title>The Witch Who Came In From The Cold: The Complete Season 2 - Lindsay Smith, Max Gladstone, Cassandra Rose Clarke, Ian Tregillis...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Prague, 1970: the epicenter in a struggle of spies and sorcerers. &lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came In From The Cold&lt;/i&gt; follows agents on opposing sides of two struggles: the Cold War, and an ancient conflict between two occult secret societies: the Consortium of Ice and the Acolytes of Flame. A CIA and KGB agent will find their loyalties to country tested when they realize they must work together to prevent the destruction of the world at the hands of the Flame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe Pritchard, grizzled CIA agent and proud American never believed in sorcery--until he walked into the wrong room in Cairo and ended up with a powerful magical Elemental living inside his head. Tanya Morozova, latest in a long line of Ice Witches, knew loyalty to the Consortium before she ever took up the KGB badge. Now they&#39;re both stationed to Prague, a city built on powerful ley lines and thrumming with both political and magical tension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Season One, a CIA extraction of a Soviet scientist ended in chaos when one of the American operatives betrayed the U.S. in order to deliver the magically-powerful scientist to the Flame. Tanya and Gabe worked together to foil the plot--but trust is hard to come by amongst spies and suspicion lingers throughout their agencies, both magical and national.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Season Two, Tanya and Gabe must deal with the fallout of their actions from Season One as each plays their own dangerous game to try to learn the secrets of the Flame without getting burned. Meanwhile a powerful sorcerer arrives in Prague to lead a ritual that could turn the tides of war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came in from the Cold&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Those who like to mix magic, spycraft, and secret history should enjoy this—it may please fans of Stross’s Laundry series.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Full of fast-paced, high-intensity action paired with magic at a level that has not been seen until now, with a cliff-hanger that lets readers know that the game is not over and has only just begun.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;The San Francisco Book Review&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came in from the Cold&lt;/i&gt; is a chilly evocation of a different kind of Cold War.&quot; —Charles Stross, author of the Laundry Files series
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Take a double shot of Le Carré, a dash of Deighton, a twist of Quiller, a splash of Al Stewart’s &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Cat&lt;/i&gt;, throw in a jigger full of elemental magic, mix well … and voilà! &lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came In From The Cold&lt;/i&gt;.” —Victor Milán, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dinosaur Lords&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The occult love child of John le Carre and &lt;i&gt;The Sandbaggers&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; —Marie Brennan, author of &lt;i&gt;A Natural History of Dragons&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;As soon as I saw that, I was instantly hooked, and the pilot jacked the intrigue to the max. Two female Soviet spy witches, an American spy with something weird drilling magical holes in his head, and a world of secrets within secrets in a locale where old-world myth and the Cold War face off, pedal to the metal . . . it’s awesome. Or as we said in 1970, Far out. &quot; —Sherwood Smith, author of &lt;i&gt;Crown Duel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The installments are easy to read one at a time, but the tangles of alliances, secrets, and shocking double-crosses will have readers up all night mumbling, “Just one more.” —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;starred review&lt;/b&gt;" />
