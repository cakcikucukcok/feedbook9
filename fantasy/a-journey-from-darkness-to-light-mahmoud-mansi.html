  <title>A Journey from Darkness to Light - Mahmoud Mansi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;Why does knowledge make us see things we don&#39;t want to see? Why does it make us suffer more than it makes us happy? Why do we exist in a world with dominating curses more than blessings? Why can&#39;t we define the true meaning of happiness, and barely smell its odor? When are we going to finally start asking the right questions?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Why are we down here on this planet, asked to seek perfection in an imperfect world? What was the true reason behind making Prophet Adam eat from the forbidden tree? When do artists finally reach their point of perfection? If human beings, animals and insects have their own psychology, what about other creatures among which are invisible ones? Not all explanations are mentioned in books But till when will we have questions without any answers?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Searching for a way, some souls ask: Why does darkness exist, while light seems endless? We search for the key chain, while we don&#39;t even know which door is the right one! But, who&#39;s she; who astonished his life, captured the sundered pieces of his heart, and brought him the keys to tons of buried secrets the one who didn&#39;t fear touching his wounds, and the one who anticipated all his moves?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some masts are old enough to be one of the antiques the sea carries or swallows, yet it still supports the deck, controls the ship, and above its towering apex, it guides the captain It&#39;s still a lively organ in the giant space of the sea. He stood there, his body straight and solid as a mast, while erecting from such bemusements with the strength of a sailor, the knowledge of a captain and the vision of an artist, he sailed for his journey, toward the endless seas of the Universe&lt;/P&gt;" />
