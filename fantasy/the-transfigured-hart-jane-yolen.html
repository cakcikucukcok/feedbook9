  <title>The Transfigured Hart - Jane Yolen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is what Richard saw in the woods really a unicorn?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Heather and Richard have little in common.  A voracious reader growing up in a large house filled with books, Richard is a sickly child that spends most of his time alone or surrounded by adults.  Heather is comfortable in a crowd, but nonetheless sneaks away on her appaloosa pony for lone adventures in woods.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
One evening after dinner, Richard spies a strange, white deer in the fading light of the woods. It leaps away into the thick brush, but Richard is certain of what he’s seen: a unicorn. And Heather—out for a ride on her pony—has also spotted the unusual hart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
When Heather and Richard meet, they cannot agree on what they’ve encountered, and they definitely do not want to share their secret. But they will soon discover that their mutual help is indeed much-needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Beloved, award-winning author Jane Yolen has created a magical tale of coming of age yet still believing in the seemingly impossible.  The Transfigured Hart bounds into the wonderful in-between world where adults rediscover childhood wonder, and children can enjoy the fantastic tale right along with them." />
