  <title>Rising Star - Kendra Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, an angels betrayal left the plane of Celestia reeling. Not long after, mortals and celestials alike fought demons in the War of the Races, mistakenly thinking a battle against the demons would never happen again. Unfortunately, now nearly two thousand years later, rumors are circulating that the Lord of the Hells has a daughter, and demonic activity in the mortal plane of Elyshaeza is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil is a rogue demon who has left the Hells for Elyshaeza. But when he encounters Shara Aotallin, an elf ordered to take him to be judged, he is suddenly thrust into a mystery that leads him and several elves to a gruesome discovery. Artemis is a young celestial left on the mortal plane who is questioning its abilities and identity. Another celestial tries to perform his duties, but is haunted by the past and the present. After a village girl, Collie, is brought to Celestia, an incident with a demonic mirror literally leads her to the Hells and back. And it is only the beginning for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Star, the first of the Rain of Stars trilogy, is an exciting fantasy tale that pitches celestials and mortals into the repetition of history as demons lurk in the shadows and all await their destinies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
