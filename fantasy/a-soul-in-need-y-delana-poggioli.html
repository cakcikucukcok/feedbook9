  <title>A SOUL IN NEED - Y. Delana Poggioli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julitta Sinclair is a teen with a complicated past and a soon to be complicated future. During a family vacation in France, her mother Chanel disappears under mysterious circumstances. Her father Joseph leaves Julitta with his mother Marie, an island medicine woman whose shop is called A Soul in Need. On&amp;nbsp; a hot Halloween afternoon, Marie approaches three mysterious strangers after she notices them staring at her shop.&amp;nbsp; The men offer to find Chanel if Marie will capture the Nefarious Nine &amp;ndash;evil spirits who&amp;#39;ve escaped from hell.&amp;nbsp; Marie realizes that the visitors are demons, and refuses to help; yet she&amp;#39;s tricked into signing a contract anyway. Marie is given 13 years to capture the Nine or she&amp;#39;ll spend eternity in the Lake of Fire as the devil&amp;#39;s apprentice.&lt;br /&gt;
Because she was tricked, Marie stubbornly disregards her obligation to the devil, opting instead to care for Julitta and her shop. But when Marie becomes desperately ill, Julitta and her best friend Niko cancel their European adventure to care for her. When a dying Marie tells Julitta about the contract, Julitta&amp;nbsp; finds the demons and make them a new offer. If they&amp;#39;ll give Marie more time, Julitta and Niko will capture the Nine. If they fail, the devil will own Julitta&amp;#39;s soul along with Marie&amp;#39;s. The demons give her six months. As she and Niko travel the world in a race against time, making allies and battling foes, Julitta finally learns the truth about what happened to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;" />
