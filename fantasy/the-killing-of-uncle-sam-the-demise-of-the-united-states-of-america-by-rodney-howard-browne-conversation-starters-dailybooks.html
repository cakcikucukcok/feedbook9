  <title>The Killing of Uncle Sam: The Demise of the United States of America by Rodney Howard-Browne | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
Men have done the most unthinkable acts in the name of power, greed and pride. Nations and citizens were sold to the most vicious and corrupt global leaders. Some believe that only small poor nations have experienced this and that the free nation of America is exempted from these but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. In The Killing of Uncle Sam: The Demise of the United States of America, Howard-Brown and Williams discusses how the downfall began on American soil. They discuss who ate away the virtue that America is &amp;ldquo;land of the free and home of the brave&amp;rdquo;. They look for hope in this darkness and leads you there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Killing of Uncle Sam captures the last two centuries of American history that the public knows little about. It examines the secret legalized system within the private central banks. These banks have gone unchecked and this book follows the money and shows you the truths behind the real domestic enemies of the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-Terrorism Expert &amp;nbsp;and Former CIA Officer Kevin Shipp says that this book is unquestionably &amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;the most accurate description of the deep state shadow government.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
