That you are limited by your senses, by your comprehension, by your knowing, language, culture, and by what you have evolved unconsciously to become.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you wake up to it, see it , know it, and understand it, you realise where that collective blind faith has got us to, and why belief structures, imperceptions, and mass ignorance are things we all need to wake up from, and do something about it, before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are also many conspiracies, control structures, cultural battles and virtual wars going on under the surface of our world too, all with no logical direction or plan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sam comes to realise that the problems that we think we have, are much worse than we realise &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and what ultimately lies behind it all is still unconscious, and there is nothing forcing it to wake up or take responsibility for the state that we are in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing that is &amp;hellip; until now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if you are still seeking answers or knowledge or meaning in a world full of mindless zombies, of illogical belief and collective control structures - then seek them not in the book that is popular, or easily found, or written by those glowing with adoration and fame ...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But find them in a story about someone who is actually doing something about IT...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
