  <title>Merlin&#39;s Mage Academy - Kenneth D Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All his life, William has been around magic. He knew he was different and would have great power one day. What he did not know or expect was that &lt;em&gt;Merlin&amp;rsquo;s Mage Academy&lt;/em&gt; would teach more than magic. One of the most important lessons is that there are dark forces in the world, and because of who and what William is, they will target him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the beginning, William is lucky enough to find friends and those that will stand beside him against that dark. Each year, the castle moves, and each year, there are battles and obstacles to face, sometimes alone and sometimes together with his friends. The threats are many, from changed animals to a dragon, from spells to enchantments and charms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;William&amp;rsquo;s time in the castle brings changes to it as well. The spirit of Merlin begins to appear more, and the many animations in the castle step forward to come to life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
