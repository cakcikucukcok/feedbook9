  <title>Broken Realm: The New Age - Autumn A Hutchings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A mystical world consumed by darkness, a boy more powerful than he knows, a sadistic dictator, and a destiny greater than any other&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With no memory of who he really is, Mason Gray, an eighteen-year-old ex-god, is trapped in the small mountain town of Leadville, Colorado. That is, until the day his friends find him and return Mason to his true world, The Realms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mason, still with no memory of his life before Leadville, has to come to terms with who he really is while trying to protect his world from the Twilight, a power that was once his own, a power now controlled by an evil god named Qadir. Secrets are uncovered as Mason learns things he never thought possible. But will he let the darkness overtake him?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the classic battle of light versus darkness, The Realms will face its greatest trial, and only Mason&amp;mdash;with the help of his sister Lexi and his friends Bridget and Griffin Knight&amp;mdash;can save The Realms from utter terror.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A new pantheon of gods, ridiculous trolls, horrific demons, dragons, romance, drama, adventure, and many more thrills can be found within the pages of Mason Gray&amp;#39;s story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
