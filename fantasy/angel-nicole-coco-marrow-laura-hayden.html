  <title>Angel - Nicole &quot;Coco&quot; Marrow, Laura Hayden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A beautiful woman awakens on a plane and discovers that things are going terribly wrong. The plane is about to crash into the Hudson River...and she can&#39;t even remember her own name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she survives the crash, the airline determines that her name is Angela Sands. But she has no idea who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporter Dante Kearns is fascinated by the woman the media dubs &quot;the Angel of the Hudson,&quot; especially once he discovers her shocking secret. Angela can hear voices in her head--the thoughts of all men around her. And when a man gets close, her face and form change into the woman of his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is Angela? And why does she believe that she was murdered before she woke up on that plane in a stranger&#39;s body? Together, Angela and Dante are going to find answers, even if they have to bring down a killer to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole &quot;Coco&quot; Marrow, wife of Ice-T, keeps readers guessing with her pulse-pounding debut novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
