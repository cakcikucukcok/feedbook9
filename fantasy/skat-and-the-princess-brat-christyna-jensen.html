  <title>Skat and the Princess Brat - Christyna Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up isnt easy. 
Skat is a young light-elf of cheery good will. Too bad he doesnt have good sense as well. His first day out from under his mothers watchful eye, he falls in love with every girl he meets. Skat then vows to win Odins pardon for light-elves he had wrongly banished from Asgard. Skat infuriates Princess Violet by giving her roses to another girl. The brat whips up a whirlwind of bad fortune to punish him. In just one day every living creature on Rose Island is sucked into their controversy. Gerd loves Skat in spite of his fickle ways. This elfin girl displays loyalty tempered with common sense, presenting a dependable role model for girls. Skat effectively stands up for himself, overcomes adversity with good will, and succeeds in his quest. Animals, light-elves, a troll, Vikings, and gods respond to Skats message that all living creatures should be treated nicely. Only a few completely selfish creatures remain untouched by his charm.Growing up isnt easy.
Skatrosenknup the Darling RosebudSkat to his friendsis a young light-elf of cheery good will. Its just too bad that he doesnt have good sense, as well. If there is mischief to be had, hell find it. Failing that, hell create it! 
From his first day out from under his mothers watchful eye, he finds each girl he meets to be irresistibleand he falls head over little heels in love with every one of them. 
	&lt;i&gt; problem is, the girls arent so forgiving of his fickle heart.&lt;/i&gt; 
Then he sets his sights on bigger and bolder goals. Annoyed by what he feels is the unfair banishment of all light-elves from Asgard, young Skat vows to convince Odin to let his people back into paradise. 
	&lt;i&gt;but the Norse gods are not exactly amused by his antics either.&lt;/i&gt;
	Skat is a scamp; no doubt, but his message that all living creatures should be treated nicely is one that everyone can get behind. His charisma and courage are his best defenses against the many scrapes he finds himself in. And in the end, only a few completely selfish creatures can resist his many charms.
