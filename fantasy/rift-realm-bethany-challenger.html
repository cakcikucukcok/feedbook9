      <meta name="description" content="If I am to believe the words that I am reading, this is a journal from my daughter, I must accept what she writes, where she has been, what she has been doing, to think otherwise would be to accept that this book is the writings of a deranged person, lost to reality and who has most likely done harm to herself and her friend and that is not my daughter.
Since the discovery of this first book, two more have appeared, so I know Jade is alive and for the most part safe, for now these books are my only tie with her and I will not give up on her so I have published her journals in the hope that someone may read them and know more, that one day she will return. 
What follows are the writings of Jade Avanasy my daughter from a world beyond ours, if I am correct outside our Universe, a place and time not of here called the Realmscape, a place she and her friend Dax were pulled into the night she went missing, one filled with fairy folk, old lore, magic, dragons, gods and demons." />
