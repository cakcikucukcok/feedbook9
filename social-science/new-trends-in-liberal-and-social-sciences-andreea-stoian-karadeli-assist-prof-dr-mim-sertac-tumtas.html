  <title>New Trends in Liberal and Social Sciences - Andreea Stoian Karadeli, Assist. Prof. Dr. Mim Sertac Tumtas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The specialist, as we know it in the modern age, is a creation of modernity. Up until the modern age, scholars were known for their expertise in multiple areas. From Avicenna (Ibn-i Sina) and Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi to Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, many medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenment scholars were polymaths, mastering knowledge from several fields. 
The needs of the modern age created specialists focusing deeply on one field. At the convergence of postmodernism and the age of the Internet, social, cultural, and economic realities of increasingly diverse societies have created a new need for the revival of the polymath. Emerging globalization post-Cold War triggered rapid social change that cannot be explained from the perspective of a single discipline.
This reality has recently increased the interest in interdisciplinary studies but established academic work that is focused on single disciplines still dominates the academic world and it offers limited opportunities for the publication of interdisciplinary studies. One of the aims of this book is to become one example for interdisciplinary work. It also aims to prepare the ground for the cultivation of scholars that can specialize in more areas on the long term. This book is made out of sixteen articles that bring together different disciplines such as educational sciences, law, linguistics, economics, culture, and sports. All articles passed the referee process. Bearing in mind that the book is the result of a multidisciplinary work, the respect towards each discipline is shown by leaving the referencing and methodology according to the common usage of the relevant discipline. Therefore, some authors have used the Chicago Manual of Style within their articles while others have used the APA system." />
