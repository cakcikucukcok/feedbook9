  <title>Basic Income and the Left - Philippe Van Parijs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is one of the most hotly debated ideas of recent years on the left &amp;ndash; and, indeed, right. The potential threat to millions of current jobs posed by robotization and artificial intelligence combined with the rise of inequality has contributed to making it a core element of the continuing post-crisis discussions on what it means to be on the left, or a social democrat, today and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is an unconditional basic income without means-test or work-test compatible with social justice and individual self-worth? Does it open up the space for an end to demeaning labour and a resurgence of voluntary work and cultural life? Is it affordable?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This collection of short but compelling essays, all previously published in &lt;em&gt;Social Europe&lt;/em&gt;, allows both proponents and opponents to make their case and is designed to extend this vital discussion to a wider audience. We are proud to have spearheaded the debate on an issue that is of vital and enduring importance for Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;" />
