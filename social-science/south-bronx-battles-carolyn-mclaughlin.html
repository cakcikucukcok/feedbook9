  <title>South Bronx Battles - Carolyn McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The South Bronx has been the poorest congressional district in the U.S. for nearly 40 years. While boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn are gentrified, the Bronx is still seen as a symbol of urban decay&amp;mdash;one where large populations of people of color live alongside new immigrants, and all of whom struggle to find affordable housing, health care, and jobs.&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Community activist Carolyn McLaughlin takes us on a journey of the Bronx through the eyes of community members. From burned out neighborhoods of the 1970s and 1980s, fighting closures of firehouses and hospitals, and exposing the redlining efforts by banks for housing, McLaughlin illustrates the spirit of the community&amp;rsquo;s commitment over the past few decades to develop non-profit housing and social service agencies, and advocate for better education, health care, and a cleaner environment. Yet despite the borough&amp;rsquo;s recent stability, neighbors still remain poor. McLaughlin asserts that by keeping the borough &amp;ldquo;poor&amp;rdquo;, it affords an entry-point for poor immigrants and minorities to have a safe haven and she warns of an incipient gentrification of portions of the South Bronx that could drive out poor people.&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;South Bronx Battles&lt;/I&gt; is a comeback story of a community that was once in crisis but now acts as a beacon for other cities to forge ahead, keep their neighborhoods ungentrified, and rebuild from the ground up.&amp;#160;" />
