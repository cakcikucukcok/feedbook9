  <title>Women&#39;s Folklore, Women&#39;s Culture - Rosan A. Jordan, Susan J. Kalcik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The essays in &lt;i&gt;Women&#39;s Folklore, Women&#39;s Culture&lt;/i&gt; focus on women performers of folklore and on women&#39;s genre of folklore. Long ignored, women&#39;s folklore is often collaborative and frequently is enacted in the privacy of the domestic sphere. This book provides insights balancing traditional folklore scholarship. All of the authors also explore the relationship between make and female views and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book begins with the private world of women, performances within the intimacy of family and fields; it then studies women&#39;s folklore in the public arena; finally, the book looks at the interrelationships between public and private arenas and between male and female activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turning our attention to previously ignored women&#39;s realms, these essays provide a new perspective from which to view human culture as a whole and make &lt;i&gt;Women&#39;s Folklore, Women&#39;s Culture&lt;/i&gt; a significant addition to folklore scholarship&lt;/p&gt;" />
