  <title>High-Risers - Ben Austen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining the ranks of &lt;em&gt;Evicted, The Warmth of Other Sons&lt;/em&gt;, and classic works of literary non-fiction by Alex Kotlowitz and J. Anthony Lukas, &lt;em&gt;High-Risers&lt;/em&gt; braids personal narratives, city politics, and national history to tell the timely and epic story of Chicago&amp;#8217;s Cabrini-Green, America&amp;#8217;s most iconic public housing project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in the 1940s atop an infamous Italian slum, Cabrini-Green grew to twenty-three towers and a population of 20,000&amp;#8212;all of it packed onto just seventy acres a few blocks from Chicago&amp;#8217;s ritzy Gold Coast. Cabrini-Green became synonymous with crime, squalor, and the failure of government. For the many who lived there, it was also a much-needed resource&amp;#8212;it was home. By 2011, every high-rise had been razed, the island of black poverty engulfed by the white affluence around it, the families dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this novelistic and eye-opening narrative, Ben Austen tells the story of America&amp;#8217;s public housing experiment and the changing fortunes of American cities. It is an account told movingly though the lives of residents who struggled to make a home for their families as powerful forces converged to accelerate the housing complex&amp;#8217;s demise. Beautifully written, rich in detail, and full of moving portraits, &lt;em&gt;High-Risers&lt;/em&gt; is a sweeping exploration of race, class, popular culture, and politics in modern America that brilliantly considers what went wrong in our nation&amp;#8217;s effort to provide affordable housing to the poor&amp;#8212;and what we can learn from those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
