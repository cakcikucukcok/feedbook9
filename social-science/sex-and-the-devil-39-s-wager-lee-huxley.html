  <title>Sex and the Devil&#39;s Wager - Lee Huxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anti-erotic elements in feminism have joined forces with Islam and Christianity to condemn prostitution, the male gaze and the natural love men have for the feminine body as a symbol of universal beauty. The author, whose religion is based in Tantra regards these attitudes both wrong and offensive to pagans.  Lee Huxley, claims to be a knower - an enlightened one who sees with the third eye and whose wisdom and lateral thinking demonstrate his special insights in this book. Lee knows the truth  the unthinkable  that Jesus Christ, the hellfire and damnation preacher, is not the Son of God but the Son of Evil. If Christ is the Son of Evil, then Lee argues from this basis, that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are blasphemies. This book asks how Western civilization could be founded on lies, delusions and blasphemies that even today are still taken seriously. This book is the result of a lifetime of research which has culminated in the formulation of the Devils Wager.  The Devils Wager challenges you, the reader, to name any moral idea from the worst evildoers of history that is as evil as the central teaching of the Bible and the Koran, namely that God will resurrect the human race and torture most of them in hell for all eternity. Fifty per cent of the damned will be women. The male God of monotheism is a hellfire pyromaniac: Jesus Christ and Allah are arsonists who burn women alive! This is the feminist issue of our times. Lee uses the writings of theologian and lapsed Catholic Mary Daly, one of the greatest feminist thinkers, to explain their common conviction that feminism  must  now assume the role of the Antichrist and bring an end to monotheism!" />
