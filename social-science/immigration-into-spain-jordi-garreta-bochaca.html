  <title>Immigration into Spain - Jordi Garreta-Bochaca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In the last fifty years Spain has experienced major changes regarding population movements and the perception the Spanish have concerning emigration and immigration as well as emigrants and immigrants. In short, in a few years it has gone from emigrating to receiving a significant flow of foreign immigration to again becoming issuers of people to Europe while immigration is still reaching the Spanish borders. All of this has led to growth in Spain’s interest in the study of international migration, its impacts on the origin and destination, designed integration policies and their implementation, as well as international comparisons. The volume presents the evolution of the migration phenomenon, the creation and maintenance of transnational networks, the most relevant factors for exclusion and social integration, the demands and forms of intervention of the social workers who work with persons of foreign origin as well as the institutional response given from social services, the evolution of immigrant students in schools and educational policies on cultural diversity in the Spanish educational system, the development of associations, and other important questions about «Immigration into Spain: Evolution and Socio-educational Challenges».&lt;/P&gt;" />
