  <title>Civilizing Capitalism - Landon R. Y. Storrs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Offering fresh insights into the history of labor policy, the New Deal, feminism, and southern politics, Landon Storrs examines the New Deal era of the National Consumers&#39; League, one of the most influential reform organizations of the early twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded in 1899 by affluent women concerned about the exploitation of women wage earners, the National Consumers&#39; League used a strategy of &quot;ethical consumption&quot; to spark a successful movement for state laws to reduce hours and establish minimum wages for women. During the Great Depression, it campaigned to raise labor standards in the unregulated, non-union South, hoping to discourage the relocation of manufacturers to the region because of cheaper labor and to break the downward spiral of labor standards nationwide. Promoting regulation of men&#39;s labor as well as women&#39;s, the league shaped the National Recovery Administration codes and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 but still battled the National Woman&#39;s Party, whose proposed equal rights amendment threatened sex-based labor laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the National Consumers&#39; League as a window on the nation&#39;s evolving reform tradition, &lt;i&gt;Civilizing Capitalism&lt;/i&gt; explores what progressive feminists hoped for from the New Deal and why, despite significant victories, they ultimately were disappointed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
