  <title>Transformational Leadership for the Helping Professions - Jean F. East</title>
      <meta name="description" content="21st-century challenges abound for those in leadership roles in the helping professions--social work, nursing, teaching, public health, and social services. It is the mission of these professionals to facilitate change, not only for consumers of  their work, but also for the organizations and communities where they endeavor to promote systems change goals. Leaders in the helping professions are called to integrate head, heart, and soul while acting as learners, stewards, and meaning makers. While many books written for human services leaders focus on the leadership roles and tasks, this book focuses growth in leadership, coupled with key competencies that leaders enact in organizations and communities. &lt;em&gt;Transformational Leadership for the Helping Professions&lt;/em&gt; combines both classic and current theories on leadership, with a philosophical lens about its meaning and practice in human services settings. Social workers, nurses, teachers, public health workers, and community leaders will find the text to be a useful guide in strengthening their consideration of leadership theory while they practice in day-to-day work. Additionally, educators and students of leadership in the helping professions will gain a solid understanding of key facets of leadership practice within a framework that inspires a social justice, empowerment, and cultural humility perspective." />
