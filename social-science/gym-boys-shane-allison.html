  <title>Gym Boys - Shane Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gym Boys examines what takes place behind the closed doors of the locker room. This book is a tribute to the body beautiful, where men who look like Greek gods are worshiped for their outsized attributes. Editor and Gaybie Award&amp;#8211;winner Shane Allison takes us into the erotic world of hard-working guys who like to work out, along with hard-bodied body builders and the men who desire them. These uninhibited stories are by the masters of the genre, and editor Shane Allison gets the party started with a true confession of his own. At the gym, in the locker room, and especially in the steam room, the hunks who look hard, work hard, and play hard inspire fantasies the world over. Come along for the ride and explore what goes on both in the gym and in those showers and locker rooms after a hard, sweaty work out. What happens when a personal trainer takes things to a whole new level with his lusty client? How rowdy does it get when rock hard jocks get it on in the showers after a game? The steamiest gay erotica ever!" />
