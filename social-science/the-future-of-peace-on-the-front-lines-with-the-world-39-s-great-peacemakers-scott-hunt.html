  <title>The Future of Peace: On The Front Lines with the World&#39;s Great Peacemakers - Scott Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this illuminating journey around the globe, Scott A. Hunt takes us face to face with true heroes including: the Dalai Lama; the famed dissident of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi; and the activist who brought peace to Latin America, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who share their historic struggles and show us how to find optimism in the face of anguish, and compassion in the place of animosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What does it mean to fight for peace? From the riotous streets in Burma to a prison cell in Vietnam, from the bombed-out streets of Belfast to the refugee camps of Palestine, Scott A. Hunt travels across the globe, often under arduous conditions, to report from the major battles that shaped and continue to shape our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Recounting histories that were not taught in school, and uncovering lessons which may have been brushed aside, Scott A. Hunt coaxes out in intimate conversations staggering stories from Vietnam&#39;s leading dissident Thich Quang Do, famed primate specialist and humanitarian Dr. Jane Goodall, Cambodia&#39;s Supreme Patriarch Maha Ghosananda, Ireland&#39;s Nobel Peace Laureate John Hume and other great leaders who have battled to end the brutality against the people and causes they cherish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the end, The Future of Peace reveals what it means to remain steadfast to a vision of compassion, to be a leader, and to preserve peace in our own day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Future of Peace is an extraordinary investigation that offers far-ranging insights and invaluable lessons - a book that changes the way we think about the world and our responsibility toward one another. &lt;/p&gt;" />
