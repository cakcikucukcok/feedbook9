  <title>Customs and Culture of the Philippines - Gladys Zabilka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This classic introduction to the rich culture and history of the Phillipines Islands is a must have for any traveler or cultural scholar.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Few countries are as rich in cultural heritage as the Republic of the Philippines.  The original inhabitants came from various parts of Southeast Asia, and outlying areas preserve many of their unique and interesting customs.  In the age of exploration the Europeans came.  The hopes of the Filipino people were finally realized when, on July 4 1946, the flag of the Philippine was raised.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Author, Galdys Zabilka has created an informal and interesting compilation for the overseas traveler or the armchair tourist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The reader will be introduced to quaint Filipino customs, tourist attractions, folk songs, foods, and sports along with a general review of Philippine history and racial background. Almost every aspect of Filipino life is touched upon in this handy little volume. Delightful illustrations for each chapter were done by M. Kuwata. Musical scores of several Philippine folk songs are included in the last chapter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
