  <title>Ghost Culture - John G. Sabol Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is part of a series of ethnographic studies in cultural hauntings and ghostly landscapes. The first book, &lt;U&gt;Ghost Excavator: Unearthing the Drama in the Mine Fields&lt;/U&gt;, was a personal excavation of the haunted Mahanoy Area. In this second book, a theory of cultural hauntings is presented that serves as a framework for investigative fieldwork. Specific techniques are introduced as a means of scientific practices to evaluate the data observed and recorded at haunted locations. This book is meant to form the infrastructure of &lt;EM&gt;&lt;U&gt;a&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; developing ghost science, one built from the &quot;bottom-up&quot;. The integrated symmetrical approach of theory and scientific practice that is outlined here is &lt;U&gt;a&lt;/U&gt; beginning point for the continuing evolution of the ghost science of the future. This search and analysis of haunting phenomena is seen as an approach that can be participated in by the many and who, through their continuing efforts, will help fill-in the &quot;blanks&quot; of a &quot;ghost map&quot; of what Shakespeare has called the &quot;undiscover&#39;d country&quot;." />
