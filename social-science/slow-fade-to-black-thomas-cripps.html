  <title>Slow Fade to Black - Thomas Cripps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set against the backdrop of the black struggle in society, Slow Fade to Black is the definitive history of African-American accomplishment in film--both before and behind the camera--from the earliest movies through World War II.  As he records the changing attitudes toward African-Americans both in Hollywood and the nation at large, Cripps explores the growth of discrimination as filmmakers became more and more intrigued with myths of the Old South: the &quot;lost cause&quot; aspect of the Civil War, the stately mansions and gracious ladies of the antebellum South, the &quot;happy&quot; slaves singing in the fields.  Cripps shows how these characterizations culminated in the blatantly racist attitudes of Griffith&#39;s The Birth of a Nation, and how this film inspired the N.A.A.C.P. to campaign vigorously--and successfully--for change.        While the period of the 1920s to 1940s was one replete with Hollywood stereotypes (blacks most often appeared as domestics or &quot;natives,&quot; or were portrayed in shiftless, cowardly &quot;Stepin Fetchit&quot; roles), there was also an attempt at independent black production--on the whole unsuccessful. But with the coming of World War II, increasing pressures for a wider use of blacks in films, and calls for more equitable treatment, African-Americans did begin to receive more sympathetic roles, such as that of Sam, the piano player in the 1942 classic Casablanca.
         A lively, thorough history of African-Americans in the movies, Slow Fade to Black is also a perceptive social commentary on evolving racial attitudes in this country during the first four decades of the twentieth century." />
