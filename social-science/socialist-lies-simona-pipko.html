Socialist Lies is a quick read thats hard to put down, showing the aggressive role Russia plays in its war against Western civilization and how the Democratic Party is destroying its free enterprise legacy and adopting socialism. Meanwhile, the Republican establishment is being shaken to its core by member anger at its inaction on critical issues.
The author sets the stage with the prologue, a firsthand narrative from her unique childhood under socialism in Russia. Then she demonstrates how Marxist theory, which opened a Pandoras Box in the nineteenth century, marched across the globe to the twentieth century. The author calls Marxism a combination of fraud with a utopian concept, which has been used by adventurers, charlatans, and criminals to acquire power. The leader who exemplified all these characteristics was Joseph Stalin.  A dogmatic Marxist, brought up within the Islamic culture, Stalin invented the marriage of communism and Islamthe reason we have been dragged into war today; it is the ideology I called Soviet Fascism.  Stalin laid out the agenda for a One World Government under the Kremlin auspicesthe agenda of WWIII against Western civilization." />
