  <title>Movie Quotes for All Occasions - James Scheibli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Great Movie Quotes for All Occasions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Best movie quotes:&lt;/b&gt; We all do it. Every day, with or without noticing, you quote movies. Hit a search engine and you can find thousands of lists of the best movie quotes of all time. From Rhett Butler to Obi-Wan Kenobi, movie quotes have become an integral part of expression. However, the movie quotes that often show up on these “best of” lists rarely lend themselves to important moments in life. Nor are they meant to provide personal motivation. Open any typical movie quote list or book and you’re likely to see “May the Force be with you,” or “I’ll have what she’s having.” Does that really do anything for us as readers looking for inspiration, motivation, or simply a beautiful phrase to couple with your own words? 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Best movie quotes for all occasions:&lt;/b&gt; That’s where I come in. I’ve scoured the movie world to track down the most appropriate, best movie quotes for every occasion. From weddings to pre-game pep talks, I’ve found the quotes that are moving, inspirational, or just plain hilarious that do more than just remind of the movies they came from. These quotes transcend their stories and enrich your life.&lt;ul&gt; 
• Looking to rally your team before the big game? Try this quote from Capt. Malcom Reynolds from the science-fiction film Serenity (2005): “You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place. So now I&#39;m asking more of you than I have before. Maybe all… So no more running. I aim to misbehave.”&lt;p&gt;
• Need a quote to cap off your perfectly humorous wedding speech with some genuine, but witty, sentiment? Try some wisdom from Juno… from Juno (2007): 
“Look, in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you. The right person is still going to think the sun shines out of your ass. That’s the kind of person that’s worth sticking with.”
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Movie Quotes for All Occasions&lt;/i&gt; provides hidden gems from a variety of film genres. Whether blockbuster megahits or forgotten indies, we’ve got the right quote for the right occasion." />
