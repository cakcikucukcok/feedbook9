  <title>As Democracy Goes, So Does Journalism - Seong Jae Min</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;As Democracy Goes, So Does Journalism: Evolution of Journalism in Liberal, Deliberative, and Participatory Democracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; explores the symbiotic relationship between democracy and journalism in an engaging historical narrative. From a liberal to a deliberative and to a participatory model, theories and practices of democracy are constantly looking for better governance. How is journalism evolving to match the vibrant changes in its democratic counterpart? This book suggests that the dominant trustee model of journalism that flourished in liberal democracy has waned; the civic-minded public journalism in deliberative democracy has had ups and downs; and the free-wheeling citizen journalism in participatory democracy is now under the spotlight, whether for its brilliance or ill repute. This book attempts to answer the vital questions facing journalism today, namely its identities, functions, and relationship to democracy and the good life. Scholars and students of journalism as well as the public interested in the past, present, and future of journalism will find this book valuable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
