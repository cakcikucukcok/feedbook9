  <title>Uncanny Valley: Adventures in the Narrative - Lawrence Weschler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Shuttling between cultural comedies and political tragedies, Lawrence Weschler&amp;#8217;s articles have throughout his long career intrigued readers with his unique insight into everything he examines, from the ordinary to the extraordinary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Uncanny Valley&lt;/I&gt; continues the page-turning conversation as Weschler collects the best of his narrative nonfiction from the past fifteen years. The title piece surveys the hapless efforts of digital animators to fashion a credible human face, the endlessly elusive gold standard of the profession. Other highlights include profiles of novelist Mark Salzman, as he wrestles with a hilariously harrowing bout of writer&amp;#8217;s block; the legendary film and sound editor Walter Murch, as he is forced to revisit his work on &lt;I&gt;Apocalypse Now&lt;/I&gt; in the context of the more recent Iraqi war film &lt;I&gt;Jarhead;&lt;/I&gt; and the artist Vincent Desiderio, as he labors over an epic canvas portraying no less than a dozen sleeping figures.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With his signature style and endless ability to wonder, Weschler proves yet again that the &amp;#147;world is strange, beautiful, and connected&amp;#8221; &lt;I&gt;(The Globe and Mail).&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;Uncanny Valley&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates his matchless ability to analyze the marvels he finds in places and people and offers us a new, sublime way of seeing the world.&lt;/div&gt;" />
