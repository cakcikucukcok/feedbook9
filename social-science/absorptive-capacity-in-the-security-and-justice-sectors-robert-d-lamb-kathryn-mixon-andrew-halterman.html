  <title>Absorptive Capacity in the Security and Justice Sectors - Robert D. Lamb, Kathryn Mixon, Andrew Halterman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In development, stabilization, and peace building, donors increasingly recognize the importance of being sensitive to the local contexts of their efforts. Yet the use of &amp;ldquo;blueprints&amp;rdquo; remains widespread. Even when standard approaches are modified for particular aid partners, there often remains a poor fit between donor efforts and local conditions. When recipients cannot absorb the aid and attention they are offered, the common response is &amp;ldquo;capacity building.&amp;rdquo; While it is true that many aid recipients do not have adequate capacity for implementation, this report presents the results of a case study demonstrating that some security and justice programs are designed and implemented without an adequate appreciation of local desires, resources, capabilities, and challenges. Absorptive capacity, in other words, is a byproduct of the donor-recipient relationship. An earlier study by the authors introduced a new framework for measuring absorptive capacity. This volume applies it to security and justice sector programs that did not meet all of their objectives in Lebanon, Cambodia, and Colombia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
