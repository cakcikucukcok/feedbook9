  <title>Courageous Journey - Barbara Youree, Ayuel Leek, Beny Ngor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This compelling, human story is coupled with timely issues facing the world: the crisis in Darfur, control of limited oil reserves, terrorism by radical Islamic groups. Told through the experiences of two boys, Ayuel Leek and Beny Ngor Chad, the book traces the journey of thousands of displaced children who walked for months across barren land, menaced by starvation, disease, wild animals, and gunfire. Author Barbara Youree, in collaboration with Leek and Chad, follows them through their years in refugee camps and their journey to the United States, where the author mentors them in college as they follow the American dream and pursue their goal of helping other Sudanese. Two million Sudanese have been killed and thousands more tortured, displaced, or sold into slavery. This is their story.&lt;/div&gt;" />
