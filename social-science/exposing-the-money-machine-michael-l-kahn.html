  <title>Exposing the Money Machine - Michael L Kahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;TRUTH AND FREEDOM INTERNATIONAL MISSION STATEMENT&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to research, scrutinize, assess, and distribute information exposing the deception, oppression, exploitation, and other evils that are affecting, or will affect the peoples of any and every nation. In addition, we will organize and equip the populace to enable them to resist and to overcome the evil entities that intend to conquer and subjugate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;CODE OF ETHICS&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will practice the following principles with the purpose of modeling and promoting the finest ethical standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most important qualities will be internalized and utilized at all times: integrity and love.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do not lie. We will live by a code of honor that will prohibit deception; as it being above all things, the most evil. &quot;Satan is the father of lies.&quot; Our integrity must never be compromised. That includes the practice of being both forthright and &quot;transparently&quot; open. We will always make our actions and motivations open to public scrutiny, without duplicity. Nobody will be able to truthfully accuse us of having &quot;hidden agendas&quot; or &quot;secretive dealings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will practice love as a verb, worded in the King James Bible as &quot;charity,&quot; it shall be our driving force, and our &quot;banner.&quot; We will practice it in action, by being forgiving, promoting social justice by generosity and sharing; by being compassionate, sympathetic, empathetic, and by avoiding being condemning. We will be servant leaders, recognizing that every human life is precious. We will be mindful that we are products of our environment, and that those who are displaying what we consider as vices and/or sins, are doing as their life experiences has shaped them to do. That will not, however, negate or diminish our love for righteousness, and our hate of evil and injustice. We must practice a discerning sense of right and wrong, without condemnation. Those who harm themselves or others should be dealt with, yet not in a &quot;punishment&quot; mentality. Any words used, or corrective actions being promoted, will have rehabilitation as motivation; or protection of the innocent as a goal. We will not return evil for evil, but will overcome evil with good. An observant and intelligent person will recognize that evil is not conquered with passivity or with supplication, and often it can only be resisted with greater force or power, sometimes that even has to be enforced by promoting fear of retribution. With that in mind, we will not disassociate with people who choose to use weapons to resist evil principalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of the United States, in their wisdom and foresight, included in the constitution the right to bear arms. This was included with the sole intent of defending the citizens from the possibility of the government becoming oppressive. In an ideal society, there would be no weapons, and no need for them. Unfortunately, the season of a confrontation of ultimate evil against those who are righteous is approaching, and evil is not always overcome with sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that expressed, TRUTH AND FREEDOM INTERNATIONAL will not promote or endorse military or violent measures of aggression, but will not attack or diminish those who defend their rights or lives with physical or violent protest, defense, or reaction. We will address such with empathy, and support the common cause with discernment and tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizing that TRUTH AND FREEDOM INTERNATIONAL will participate in will include educational distribution of information; marches and protests; legal action and other measures to promote social justice; boycotting to inhibit exploitations, and civil disobedience to get the message across that evil will not be tolerated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of TRUTH AND FREEDOM INTERNATIONAL are aware that the evil powers manipulate and control the planet by means of money and fear. In the not-distant future, they will withhold the food supply as well as other necessities from those who do not comply with their agenda. With that understanding, this organization will prepare means for supplying goods and services to those who are engaged in the resistance everywhere around the world. We will help coordinate strategy and implementation towards survival and victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person who is affiliated with TRUTH AND FREEDOM INTERNATIONAL will be subject to threats of physical harm (even death), false accusations (including possible imprisonment) and scrutinization by agents of the evil principalities. We will not be immune to physical assault, imprisonment, torture, psychological control, threats, hunger, slander, etc... Those with families must take account the welfare of the ones that they love, and what they would or would not do if these loved ones were threatened with harm. I myself would risk my life as well as my loved ones for the greater cause of humanity, but not everybody feels the same way. However, this organization must ensure that all those who are affiliated have taken everything into account, have &quot;counted the cost&quot; evaluated risk verses necessity and purpose, and are committed to the cause, well aware of all implications and possibilities, as well as the results of participation, or the lack of it, to selves and to the welfare of all citizens of planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
