  <title>The Cocoa Plantations America’S Chocolate Secret Forced Child Labor, Rape, Sodomy, Abuse of Children, Child Sex Trafficking, Child Organ Trafficking, Child Sex Slaves - Raymond C. Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children working the cocoa plantations for Americas chocolate. Would you ever dream of such abuse happening to five-year-old boys and girls, children being worked worse than animals on the cocoa plantations to get the cocoa bean, the main ingredient in chocolate, to America. The cocoa beans are covered with the blood, sweat, and tears of five-year-old children sold for slave labor to work on the cocoa plantations. Everyone has limited freedoms, even in America. We protect our children. They dont have to work on cocoa plantations like five-year-old children in Africa. What should we do about the children who are being abused? 
Laws are in place. The International Labor Organization, Convention laws, and the Convention of the Rights of the Child, these laws are not being enforced. American people want chocolate but are not aware of the abuse taking place on the Ivory Coast of Africa and Ghana, where 60 percent of the cocoa beans in the world are produced on the cocoa plantations. The cocoa plantations on the Ivory Coast of Africa and Ghana are noted as being the worst form of child slavery in the history of the world. Five-year-old children are working one hundred hours a week. Children are sold into slavery and will never have a childhood or education. Children working to get cocoa beans to America so the chocolate industries can produce chocolate while ignoring the laws in place. Five-year-old children are being raped, sodomized, beaten with bike chains, and possibly murdered trying to escape the cocoa plantations? Chocolate is a trillion-dollar industry. Five-year-old children are being used as child sex slaves, in sex trafficking, and organ trafficking? Why, America, why? Please help the children!" />
