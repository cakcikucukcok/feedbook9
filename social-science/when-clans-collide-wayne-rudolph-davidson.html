  <title>When Clans Collide - Wayne Rudolph Davidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Clans Collide: The Germination of Adams Family Tree through Surname, Life Experience, and DNA tells the story of author Wayne Rudolph Davidsons surname and its ancestral connection to individuals and events that have shaped the world in which we live. When Davidson set out to discover the ancestral history of his surname, he had no idea what he would encounter. On his journey, he discovered that people with the surname of Davidson have contributed to government and politics, business and economics, social sciences, religion, education, science and technology, music and entertainment, sports and recreation, and military history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research included here illustrates events ranging from the evolution of the English Crown and the building of North America to the American Revolution and the American Civil War. He also discovered quite a few events linked to African American history, including the period of Reconstruction, Buffalo Soldiers and the Great Plains, and the Great Migration. Davidsons have also contributed to the popularity of sports and entertainment, the growth of the office of the president of the United States, both World Wars, and the sacrifice of heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting and informative, When Clans Collide explores the history of one surname and provides a foundation and plan for making the connection to your own ancestral heritage through your surname.&lt;/p&gt;" />
