  <title>The Return of the Galon King: History, Law, and Rebellion in Colonial Burma - Maitrii Aung–Thwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In late 1930, on a secluded mountain overlooking the rural paddy fields of British Burma, a peasant leader named Saya San crowned himself King and inaugurated a series of uprisings that would later erupt into one of the largest anti-colonial rebellions in Southeast Asian history. Considered an imposter by the British, a hero by nationalists, and a prophet-king by area-studies specialists, Saya San came to embody traditional Southeast Asia&#39;s encounter with European colonialism in his attempt to resurrect the lost throne of Burma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Return of the Galon King&lt;/em&gt; analyzes the legal origins of the Saya San story and reconsiders the facts upon which the basic narrative and interpretations of the rebellion are based. Aung-Thwin reveals how counter-insurgency law produced and criminalized Burmese culture, contributing to the way peasant resistance was recorded in the archives and understood by Southeast Asian scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary study reveals how colonial anthropologists, lawyers, and scholar-administrators produced interpretations of Burmese culture that influenced contemporary notions of Southeast Asian resistance and protest. It provides a fascinating case study of how history is treated by the law, how history emerges in legal decisions, and how the authority of the past is used to validate legal findings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
