  <title>Post Globalisation Politics of Language in Maharashtra - Deepak Tanaji Pawar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a slightly revised version of the Thesis titled &#39;Post Globalisation Politics of Language in Maharashtra&#39; submitted to the University of Mumbai for Ph.D. The book details the trajectory of Language policy and Politics in Unified Maharashtra. It begins with introducing the concepts of language policy, politics and provides details of the scholarly works on language politics in India. It then focuses on the struggle for the creation of Unified Maharashtra and the awareness about Marathi identity. It evaluates creation of language related institutions and implementation of language policy during the long regime of the Congress party. The role of the opposition parties is discussed at length. The focus i s on Shi vsena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, parties that have used the Marathi plank for electoral politics. The role of civil society organisations in filling up the vacuum when political parties abandoned the Marathi agenda is discussed along with their limitations. The book looks at globalisation especially cultural globalisation both as a challenge and opportunity. The author proposes an alternate idea of language politics which in the context of Maharashtra he calls Marathikaaran -the politics and economics of Marathi language, culture and the Marathi speaking community. The book expects that this would be a pan India phenomenon whereby the entire federal balance of power would be revisited." />
