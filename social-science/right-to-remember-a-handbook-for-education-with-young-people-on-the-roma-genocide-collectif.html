  <title>Right to Remember - A Handbook for Education with Young People on the Roma Genocide - Collectif</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right to  Remember&lt;/em&gt; is a self-contained educational resource for all those wishing to  promote a deeper awareness of the Roma Genocide and combat discrimination. The  handbook is based on the principles of human rights education, and places  remembrance as an aspect of &lt;em&gt;learning about&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthening the identity of Roma young people is a priority for the Roma  Youth Action Plan of the Council of Europe. This implies the creation of an  environment where they can grow up free from discrimination and confident about  their identity and future perspectives, while appreciating their history and  their plural cultural backgrounds and affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roma Genocide carried out before and during the Second World War has  deeply impacted on Roma communities across Europe and plays a central role in  understanding the prevailing antigypsyim and discrimination against Roma.  Learning about the Genocide is very important for all young people. For Roma  young people it is also a way to understand what was perpetrated against their  communities, and to help them to com to terms with their identity and situation  today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Involving young people, including Roma youth, in researching, discussing and  discovering the meanings of the Roma Genocide is a way to involve them as agents  and actors in their own understanding of human rights and of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right to Remember&lt;/em&gt; includes educational  activities, as well as ideas for commemoration events, and information about the  Genocide and its relevance to the situation of the Roma people today. It has  been designed primarily for youth workers in non-formal settings, but it will be  useful for anyone working in education, including in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
