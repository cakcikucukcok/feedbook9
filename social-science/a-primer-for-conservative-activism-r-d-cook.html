  <title>A Primer for Conservative Activism - R.D. Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wake Up, America!
Thought-provoking new book espouses the ideals of conservatism to protect American interests
Lone Pine, CA  (Release Date TBD)  With financial powerhouses going bankrupt or being sold, and America deep in the despair of an economic recession, there is something definitely wrong with our country today.  The US Presidential elections is looming in the horizon, the chance to set this great nation back on track is an opportunity that should not be missed.  Author and conservative thinker R.D. Cook enlightens readers with the problems besetting the US  and proposals to correct them  in this thought-provoking book, A Primer for Conservative Activism.
R.D. Cook, who bills himself as An Everyday, Non-famous American, slams secular and socialist liberals in A Primer for Conservative Activism. Even some Republicans will feel his barbs as he exposes some of the more blatant abuses being forced on American citizens by all three branches of our government  but more especially by the far left liberals in our society. This book identifies the problems in our country and proposes actions for conservatives and moderates to counter these erosions of the Constitution, our way of life, and national identity.  
Some of the areas addressed include the following: the tragedy of abortion rulings by the courts; the twisting of the meaning of the Constitution by the Supreme Court; the dangers of liberal indoctrination in our public schools; irresponsible government spending; taxes and their effects on our economy and society; the political and societal costs of illegal immigration; the dangers of Islamofascism; the misguided approach to climate change; and the true meaning of religion as intended by our Founding Fathers.  
Conservatives and moderates are encouraged throughout the pages of A Primer for Conservative Activism to become more informed  and become activists in the conservative cause! So get a copy now. For more information, log on to www.Xlibris.com.
About the Author
The author was born in 1942 in Modesto California and raised through my freshman year of high school in Turlock California. Small town values were an integral part of the community I was raised in and had a profound impact on my worldview. Religion, moral and ethical values were the backbone of the community and they were practiced in every level of the community at that time. Although I did not obtain a degree from college, I concentrated on the biological and physical sciences in high school and college. I joined the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department and served there for 28 years, retiring as a sergeant in 1992. Since my retirement I have worked as a heavy equipment operator in Underground utility installation and also on wetland mitigation projects. I consider myself to be politically conservative but I am registered as an Independent.
