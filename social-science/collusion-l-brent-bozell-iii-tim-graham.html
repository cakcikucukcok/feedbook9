  <title>Collusion - L. Brent Bozell, III, Tim Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Never before has the so-called mainstream media shown such naked political bias as in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Barack Obama was narrowly reelected, with naked support from a liberal media desperate to hide his failures, trumpet his accomplishments, and discredit his GOP rivals. Bachmann, Perry, Cain, Gingrich, Santorum: one by one the media took them apart using hidden-camera expos&amp;#233;s, innuendo from anonymous accusers, repetition of harmful sound bites, and irrelevant&amp;#8212;even untrue&amp;#8212;storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Mitt Romney emerged as the Republican Party&amp;#39;s nominee, the liberal media went to work in earnest. They repeated Obama&amp;#39;s campaign caricatures that Romney terrified his family dog, enjoyed firing people, and was nothing more than a willing tool of wealthy radical-right extremists. The &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; published a 5,400-word &amp;#34;expos&amp;#233;&amp;#34; on the allegation that in 1965 he may have pinned down a boy and cut his hair. Those same Post readers were then treated to 5,500 words on Barack Obama&amp;#39;s lifelong love of basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unquestionably, 2012 was the year when the liberal news media did all in their power to steal the presidential election&amp;#8212;and they arguably succeeded. Media Research Center Founder and President Brent Bozell and MRC Director of Media Analysis Tim Graham provide the dramatic and conclusive evidence to prove this point&amp;#8212;and show conservatives how to put an end to the leftist media agenda threatening democracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
