  <title>Rise of the Red Engineers - Joel Andreas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Rise of the Red Engineers&lt;/I&gt; explains the tumultuous origins of the class of technocratic officials who rule China today. In a fascinating account, author Joel Andreas chronicles how two mutually hostile groups—the poorly educated peasant revolutionaries who seized power in 1949 and China&#39;s old educated elite—coalesced to form a new dominant class. After dispossessing the country&#39;s propertied classes, Mao and the Communist Party took radical measures to eliminate class distinctions based on education, aggravating antagonisms between the new political and old cultural elites. Ultimately, however, Mao&#39;s attacks on both groups during the Cultural Revolution spurred inter-elite unity, paving the way—after his death—for the consolidation of a new class that combined their political and cultural resources. This story is told through a case study of Tsinghua University, which—as China&#39;s premier school of technology—was at the epicenter of these conflicts and became the party&#39;s preferred training ground for technocrats, including many of China&#39;s current leaders." />
