  <title>French Port - Charles Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="French Port is dying.  Modern medicine has doubled its population.  The island&#39;s farmers have harvested its trees to bring more land under cultivation.  The sun dries out the top soil and the wind takes it out to sea.  The island&#39;s disaster is not only ecological.  French Port once exported modest quantities of timber and some potatoes.  Now it must import fertilizers, which it can&#39;t afford, just to produce enough food.  French Port is going broke.  Few people can afford a ticket off the island and most don&#39;t want to go anyway.  French Port is home.  
Edward Warren is a retired, disenchanted, and once removed native son who comes to the island looking for something meaningful to fill an empty life.  On property once belonging to his grandmother he discovers an artesian pool capable of solving many of the island&#39;s problems and of making Warren as rich and as important as an island resident can be.  Soon he meets an alluring, lonely woman with an ugly past who permits him to board platonically in her home.  The American could for once feel socially productive and, for once, he might achieve personal happiness.    
But, as a newly acquired, cynical friend points out, &quot;people will fight over a turd.  They will certainly fight over the water Warren has discovered and owns but, surprising, Warren increasingly finds himself enjoying their conflict.  
French Port cautions that all associations of people are charged with suppressed hatreds and that nothing triggers violence like an outsider with a little power who means well." />
