  <title>Upholding the Rule of Law - Judge Frank B Borowiec</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Part autobiography and part examination of our current system of social security, &lt;i&gt;Upholding the Rule of Law&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a treatise on what happened with that agency in the 1970s and 1980s; Judge Borowiecs insights provide a methodology to eliminate the massive disability claims backlog that continues to plague the Social Security Administration and which simultaneously impoverishes the thousands of disability claimants waiting two years or more for an agency decision on their disability claims. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author Judge Frank B Borowiec artfully explains the classic conflict between government agencies charged with efficiently and effectively executing their statutory mandates and their administrative law judges who have a sworn duty as independent, unbiased and impartial arbiters to protect the due process constitutional rights of all individuals contesting what they believe to be erroneous agency decisions. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with his childhood, he relates those significant details of his life, including his service during World War II, and a chance meeting with attorney J. Harry Tiernan, that would profoundly influence his career in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
