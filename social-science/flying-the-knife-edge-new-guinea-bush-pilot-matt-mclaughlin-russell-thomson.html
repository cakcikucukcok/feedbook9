  <title>Flying the Knife Edge: New Guinea Bush Pilot - Matt McLaughlin, Russell Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not about the destination...it&amp;rsquo;s about the journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Flying the Knife Edge&amp;rsquo; is the story of an ordinary man experiencing extraordinary things as a pilot in Papua New Guinea in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After an untimely exit from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, Matt McLaughlin took a leap into the unknown, travelling to Papua New Guinea to work as a missionary pilot. He soon switched from missionary to mercenary, and over the next three and a half years, as he built up the necessary experience to chase his goal of becoming an Airline captain, his life was a rollercoaster ride of adventure, risk, near-misses, and tragedy. Matt lived on the knife edge of bush pilot ops in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most dangerous flying environments. Along the way he soaked up some fascinating local history:&amp;nbsp;the country&amp;#39;s vital role in WWII&amp;rsquo;s Pacific Theatre; the disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart; the chaos of the Bougainville civil war; the Morobe gold rush of the 1930s...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The gap in the cloud became smaller and smaller as I descended, a shrinking tunnel twisting down the gorge. In a matter of seconds I was so low my wheels barely cleared the trees on the valley floor as I passed, and jungle-clad walls closed in on me until I was a mere wingspan from both sides of the valley. And then, in an instant, the gap was gone and I was flying blind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the bottom of a gorge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With terrain on both sides rising thousands of feet above me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time stopped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The passengers started screaming, anticipating the aircraft impacting the side of the mountain. And their deaths.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had the capacity for just one other thought:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will I hear the sound of the airframe smashing into the trees as we crash, or will I be dead before it registers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
