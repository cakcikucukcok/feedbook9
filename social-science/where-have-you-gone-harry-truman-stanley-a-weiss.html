  <title>Where Have You Gone, Harry Truman? - Stanley A. Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine starting a new career at the beginning of your sixth decade on earth&amp;mdash;and then succeeding at it beyond your wildest expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A self-made business magnate, international bon vivant, and founder of a nonprofit organization influential on national security issues, Stanley Weiss felt something was missing: a sense of purpose. That&amp;rsquo;s why, in his late fifties, he began to write about the world leaders, diplomats, and generals he had become confidants with across six continents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
For three decades, he has brought rare behind-the-scenes looks at countries most Westerners have only begun to understand, explaining the importance of key issues, players, and regions long before they were considered important. Well before the attention of the world was shifting to the places he knew best&amp;mdash;from India to Indonesia, Myanmar to Mexico, Thailand to the Middle East&amp;mdash;he was explaining how much they mattered and urging the United States to pay attention. When the history of Asia and the West&amp;rsquo;s pivot eastward in the twenty-first century is written, Stanley Weiss will provide the first draft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
For those who believe US leadership still matters&amp;mdash;and that it&amp;rsquo;s never too late to pursue a lifelong dream&amp;mdash;Where Have You Gone, Harry Truman? will inspire, inform, provoke&amp;mdash;and enthrall.&lt;/p&gt;" />
