  <title>Marilyn Monroe - Jack V. Hattem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Dr. Jack Hattem first became interested in Marilyn Monroe&#39;s death at the Suicide Prevention Center in Los Angeles in 1962. After three decades as a Clinical Psychologist he decided to write a &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;factual&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; account of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;real&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; circumstances in which she died.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book is a unique view of Marilyn Monroe, despite the millions of words written about her. It is the result of a research study into toxic relationshops exactly like Marilyn&#39;s, where one person tries to drive another to kill themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is about Marilyn&#39;s psychiatric condition and how her psychiatric mistreatment led to her death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The author, for the first time, offers a psychological view of Marilyn Monroe&#39;s life which explains most of her troubled relationships and her addictions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book is about the author&#39;s need to understand why people choose to kill themselves. It ends with a conspiracy hidden over forty five years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book is about why Marilyn died, how she died, and who was directly responsible for her death! Even the Cuban missile crisis played a role in her death.
