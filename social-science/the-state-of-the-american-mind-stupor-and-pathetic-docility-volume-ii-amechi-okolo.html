  <title>The State of the American Mind: Stupor and Pathetic Docility Volume Ii - Amechi Okolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, The State of the American Mind: Stupor and Pathetic Docility 
Volume One begins to unravel some of the most obvious, perplexing, embarrassing
and enduring problems and contradictions of American history and sociology, viz.,  how
could the American revolution that started with the most ringing and most inspiring Declarations of human equality in
world history end up establishing the most vicious, exploitative society the world ever knew  Black chattel slavery and
only ten percent white enfranchisement, etc. Further, how could men of such great wisdom and intellect like George
Washington, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and others who were Enlightenment scholars and clearly knew that
slavery was despicable and evil, because they had variously experienced white servitude and slavery themselves,
collude to establish and institutionalize the horrible system of Negro chattel slavery in America; and also disenfranchised
over 90 percent of people of their own race  actions that racism could not explain. The structural/institutional slavery
system they established, and the resultant consequent racism hobbles America today as it did in the past, and forced Eric
Holder, the Attorney General to declare that, America is a nation of cowards, when it comes to race discussions. Thus,
this book starts with serious critical discussions of race in America and reveals what no textbook has ever done, viz.,
 that most early American whites and Blacks were slaves  an uncomfortable fact that would shock most Americans
because it contradicts the orthodoxy or the dominant narrative that only Blacks were brought here in chains. Further,
the book also shows the year Black slavery started  something almost, all textbooks got wrong. It also shows who, was
the fi rst Black slave in America  something no textbook ever mentions. It also shows when and how racism started in
America and many other very sensitive and embarrassing but necessary issues that America avoids but must be frankly
discussed for America to move forward. This book therefore shatters the two dominant themes of Americas history and
sociology that Blacks were brought into America in chains as slaves while whites came to America in search of freedom,
as Harvard educated President Obama famously told us in his race speech. Thus, the crowning lesson of this book, in
addition to discussing some critical policy issues like education, health care, etc., is that it discovers the centripetal force
of the American society that eluded contemporary Americans because American bosses have laboriously concealed the
facts from the public  the scary but clearly healthy uniting fact that most Americans are united by their common
ancestry, their universal history and experience of servitude, bond-indentures and slavery. Nothing is more universal, more
common and more shared in American history and sociology than the fact that most of our ancestors, black and white,
were servants, bond-indentures and slaves who were dominated and super-exploited by few overlords. Colonial America
was the preferred dumping ground for British, outcasts, rejects, criminals, masterless class, vagabonds, bond-indentures,
slaves, etc., until 1776 when Australia replaced America as the British dump for its rejects and surplus citizens. Thus, that
America was a nation founded by British rejects and losers is inherently more rational than the prevailing orthodoxy or the
Obama theory of Americas founders that they were great honorable men who journeyed across the ocean for freedom
because of the obvious reason that good, powerful achieving citizens do not normally emigrate to new uncharted lands." />
