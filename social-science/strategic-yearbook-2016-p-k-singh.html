  <title>Strategic Yearbook 2016 - P K Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="India’s First War of Independence in 1857 ended in a fiasco, primarily for want of effective leadership and perhaps equally important, for lack of a viable strategy. Even after Independence, India has been found wanting on many occasions in dealing with situations concerning our National Security.
The world at large especially the intelligentsia believes that India lacks strategic culture. The deficiency, if any, perhaps lies in India&#39;s reluctance to express its perceptions on strategic issues as also to formulate a long term strategic view.  
This book contains series of articles by eminent persons and experts on various aspects of National Security, with the aim to provide an overall strategic perspective, which could contribute to evolution and dissemination of strategic thought on challenges facing the Nation." />
