  <title>Guide to Modified Exhaust Systems: A Reference for Law Enforcement Officers and Motor Vehicle Inspectors - Noise Free America</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Guide to Modified Exhaust Systems: A Reference for Law Enforcement Officers and Motor Vehicle Inspectors is a slim, portable manual for law enforcement officials, motor vehicle inspectors, prosecutors, and legislators, as well as all citizens who desire peace and quiet. Excessive noise is a major public health issue. High noise levels are associated with hearing loss, heart disease, sleep deprivation, chronic fatigue, ringing of the ears, and aggressive behavior. Loud noise also damages communities, reduces property values, and denies individuals the right to peacefully enjoy their own home and property.  One of the major sources of excessive and unnecessary noise is from motorcycles equipped with modified exhaust systems. By definition, a modified exhaust is not of the type installed at the time of manufacture, does not meet the manufacturer&#39;s specifications, does not comply with manufacturing regulatory standards, and is the root cause of excessively loud vehicles.  Guide to Modified Exhaust Systems: A Reference for Law Enforcement Officers and Motor Vehicle Inspectors concisely provides law enforcement personnel and regular citizens the tools they need to fight back against excessive vehicle noise levels. The book includes numerous color photographs to make it easy to visually identify the illegal equipment installed on some motorcycles that is responsible for the great majority of nuisance noise levels." />
