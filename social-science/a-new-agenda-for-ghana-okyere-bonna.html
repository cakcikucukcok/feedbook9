  <title>A New Agenda for Ghana - Okyere Bonna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Former Colony Faces Frustrations in Early Nationhood
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Vision for the future is the only way that a nation can progress. Author Okyere
Bonna brings readers an accurate depiction of the lack of vision in Ghana, Africa,
and offers the vision that citizens of Ghana need to advance their country in
his new book, &lt;i&gt;A New Agenda for Ghana: Building a Nation on Vision and Ideas
(Volume 1)&lt;/i&gt; (now available through Author House) and &lt;i&gt;A New Agenda for Ghana:
Building Bridges for Positive Change (Volume 2)&lt;/i&gt; (now available through Libras).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though its fi fty years since Ghana became a nation, it still operates with a
residual colonial mentality, Bonna says. This book is about the political
mismanagement that has resulted in this lack of progress, as well as the frustrations
of Ghanaians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The frustration over how the establishment is running the nation is heartbreaking
to say the least . . . In these pages, I provide numerous examples that prove how
the current government is handling economic, social, and political issues to the
detriment of the people and posterity, Bonna says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bonna urges Ghanaians to read this book before voting in the 2008 elections.
He says the insights provided will lead to more informed choices at the polls.
Those who are supposed to uphold and administer laws of the land are now the
big breakers of the rules and laws, he says. Leaders must lead by example. The
president we elect in 2008 must be a visionary. The presidency must be about
ideas and principles instead of thievery and personalities. It must seek to lift the
nations sight and spirit and move them to higher grounds. Our new president
must strengthen the capacities of anticorruption agencies. The government must
honor our values and lead us into the future and make us proud. The government
must set a standard of good and responsive governance for our age and ages to
come and build and strengthen institutions throughout our nation." />
