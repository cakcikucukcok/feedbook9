  <title>After Occupy - Frank Sykes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In light of the predatory practices employed by massive corporationssome of which are even bigger than nationsand their wealthy owners, a movement arose from among the people known as the 99 percent, those who are not among the wealthiest 1 percent of the population. The world watched as members of the Occupy movement poured into the streets, demanding that those responsible for the economic crises faced by the world be held accountable for their negligence and misconduct. 
Now, however, the crowds have gone; their voices are muted, but their demands endure. In light of the current situation, whats next for the world? The answer is action.
In this compact manifesto, Frank Sykes summarizes the ideas that were voiced by the thousands who converged on Wall Street and in large cities across the globe, drawing a map of the future of this global phenomenon. Ordinary people demand not only our fair share of the wealth generated by our work and ingenuity, but also a say in its distribution. 
Even though the Occupiers have gone home, the problems they protested still exist, and the need to act is more urgent now than ever!" />
