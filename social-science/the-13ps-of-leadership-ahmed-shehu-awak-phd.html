  <title>The 13Ps of Leadership - Ahmed Shehu Awak, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides an insight into the world of leadership and what it entails. The various leadership styles from the social science perspective were discussed, in order to provide knowledge of leadership research and continuous research by scholars of the world.
The author, however, came up with some prerequisites/elements termed as the 13Ps of leadership, explained in an applied and practical manner, which is hoped to shape the minds of present and potential leaders, in imbibing positive responsibilities and characteristics of leadership.
Speeches, quotations, direct views, shared quotations and stories and verbal views (mostly drawn from the Nigerian society) were all captured and used in an attempt to give a picture, a clear message, and meaning to the 13Ps.
The book focuses on the psyche of an individual as a leader and a sane human being with the objective of making the society a better place. It is focused more on public leadership but not limited to all other leadership positions. Every other leader should be able to pick a thing or two for further improvement and self-development (CEOs, MDs, political office holders, etc.)." />
