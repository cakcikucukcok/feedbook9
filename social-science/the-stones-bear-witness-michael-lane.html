  <title>The Stones Bear Witness - Michael Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Critics of the Bible today often say, Science has disproved the Bible. Others say that there is no evidence to support that the Bible is anything more than a book of myths and fables. But the science of archaeology is seldom mentioned by these critics. Even though no provable archaeological discovery has disproved the Bible, there have been thousands of discoveries that support the authenticity of the Bible. This book is designed to show just a few of these discoveries. In this book, the author has visited and photographed many sites and will show the archaeological evidence that can be found there and how it supports biblical accounts. The main purpose of this book is to show evidence that the Bible can be trusted and is authentic." />
