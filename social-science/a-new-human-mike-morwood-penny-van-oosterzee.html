  <title>A New Human - Mike Morwood, Penny Van Oosterzee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In October 2004, a team of Australian and Indonesian anthropologists led by Mike Morwood and Raden Pandji Soejono stunned the world with their announcement of the discovery of the first example of a new species of human, &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;, which they nicknamed the &quot;Hobbit.&quot; This was no creation of Tolkien&#39;s fantasy, however, but a tool-using, fire-making, cooperatively hunting person.
