  <title>Steps to Local Government Reform - Allyn O. Lockner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does the performance of your local government leave something to be desired? Maybe youre not satisfied with the services your government provides, or maybe the cost for these services is far too much. If so, take heart; you can do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steps to Local Government Reform&lt;/em&gt; is your step-by-step guide to undertaking reform on the local level. Public manager &lt;strong&gt;Allyn O. Lockner&lt;/strong&gt; combines years of experience in the public sector to show how you, as a resident or an elected local official, can work with others to successfully implement change within your community. Lockner explains how to make numerous choices regarding the preparation for, and the study, planning, marketing, approval, implementation, and evaluation of reforms. He also shows you how to share these reform results with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using various criteria, comparisons, practices, analyses, and other studies aimed at local government performance, Lockner delves into the sometimes tricky world of enacting reform. He reveals how local government works and provides a map for maneuvering around bureaucratic roadblocks. In addition, he includes a comprehensive bibliography for research, an appendix of terms commonly used in the reform process, and guides to creating reform models that are likely to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this compendium, you can help resolve vital issues, improve your community, and live a better life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
