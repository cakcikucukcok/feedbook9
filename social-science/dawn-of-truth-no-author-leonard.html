  <title>Dawn of Truth - No Author Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book challenges current beliefs about God and religion, with particular emphasis upon misconceptions popularized by the Christian religion.  The common belief, that a God of good is at war with a powerful fallen angel of evil, wherein God imposes irreconcilable punishment upon those who fail to accept a particular set of dogma as being the only acceptable truth, is shown to be not only false, but in conflict with the very nature of God, and Its inspired teachings.
&lt;br&gt;
Dawn of Truth begins with an examination of contemporary beliefs about God, offering an alternative view that is capable of satisfying the skeptical and scientific mind.  It goes on from there to propose a plan or intention of God that provides a believable explanation for the cause of suffering in the world; revealing the true purpose of religion and philosophy, as they relate to soul development.
&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps the most controversial subject dealt with in this book, is the multi-dimensionality of soul; describing mankind as an expression or extension of God, rather than as a totally separate entity.  Within this paradigm, all that exists is but a manifestation of the One; separate only in its temporary state of illusion or limited perception.
&lt;br&gt;
In Dawn of Truth, the author draws from his own personal experiences, or ascents into higher states of awareness, to disclose the many truths misunderstood or denied by the worlds major religions.  The author reveals how all people, regardless of religious affiliation, can apply the universal truths (taught by enlightened masters) to escape their present state of suffering and fear, and move into realms of love, peace and joy.
&lt;br&gt;
This book outlines a way whereby all who choose, can dissolve their feelings of guilt; experiencing ascension into higher states of awareness through an expansion of love." />
