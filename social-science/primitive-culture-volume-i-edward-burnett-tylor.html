  <title>Primitive Culture Volume I - Edward Burnett Tylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Use of the term &quot;culture&quot; as an expression of the full range of learned human behavior patterns began with this classic two-volume work, first published in 1871. Edward B. Tylor, the first Professor of Anthropology at the University of Oxford, declared that culture is &quot;that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.&quot; Tylor is credited with the establishment of anthropology as a scientific discipline, and his groundbreaking work was highly influential in the development of cultural evolution as the foundation for anthropologic studies. &lt;BR&gt;Tylor&#39;s unilinear model of development maintains that humans share a common history, evolving from a single primitive form. His studies of the languages, rituals, and beliefs of societies from around the world pioneered the use of statistical data and substantiated his view of a universal pattern of development in all cultures. Volume&amp;nbsp;I of &lt;I&gt;Primitive Culture&lt;/I&gt; focuses on social evolution, language, and myth. Volume&amp;nbsp;II focuses on Tylor&#39;s interpretation of animism in society, offering details of the endlessly varied ideas and beliefs regarding the soul, spirits, and gods.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
