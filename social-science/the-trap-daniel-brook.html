  <title>The Trap - Daniel Brook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Takes dead aim at the conservative economic consensus that has dominated U.S. politics . . . Biting and necessary.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The American Prospect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this provocative, witty, and revealing polemic, Daniel Brook&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Trap &lt;/i&gt;argues that the exploding income gap--a product of the conservative ascendance--is systematically dismantling the American dream, as debt-laden, well-educated young people are torn between their passions and the pressure to earn six-figure incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising education, housing, and health-care costs have made it virtually impossible for all but the corporate elite to enjoy what were once considered middle-class comforts. Thousands are afflicted with a wrenching choice: take up residence on America&#39;s financial and social margins or sell out. And it&#39;s not just impoverished teachers and social workers, struggling to pay their rent, who are hurt. From the activist who works to give others a living wage but isn&#39;t paid one himself, to the universal health-care advocate who becomes a management consultant for Big Pharma, Brook presents a damning indictment of the economic and political landscape that traps young Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the best and the brightest cannot afford to serve the public good, Brook asks, what are we selling out: an individual&#39;s career, or the very promise of American democracy?&lt;/p&gt;" />
