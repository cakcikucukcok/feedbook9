  <title>In My Opinion - David Reeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have written this book as a way to vent my frustrations and anger caused by the way our federal government looks upon and treats the average citizens of this country.  We are nothing but pawns that are intended to serve the wealthy.  
They spy on us using cameras on just about every corner as well as inside buildings.  They eves drop on our telephone conversations using hi-tech receivers.  They monitor what we do and where we go on our computers. They even humiliate us in airports by forcing everyone to pass through detection devises as well as x-ray machines that penetrate to expose our most private parts.  We are left with no dignity at all.  They blacklist us from flying because someone somewhere has deemed us as a threat. They use the excuse that everything they do is for our protection and safety.  
In my opinion there are three things that would work a lot better and far less costly.  The first thing would be to allow any anyone that wants carry a hand gun on board.  Terrorist would be stupid to attempt high jacking a plane if there was a possibility of 200 or more armed people.   The second thing would be for our government to stay the hell out of other countries business.  And the third thing would be to warn all countries that if any attempt is made to harm American citizens it will be considered an act of aggression and will result in action of extreme prejudice against the country from which the attackers came.
My book details the things, in my opinion, are the major issues and what I propose to resolve them!" />
