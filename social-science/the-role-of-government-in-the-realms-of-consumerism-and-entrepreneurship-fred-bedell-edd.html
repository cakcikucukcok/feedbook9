  <title>The Role of Government in the Realms of Consumerism and Entrepreneurship - Fred Bedell, EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have always been interested in the role government plays in our daily lives. All too often, the government is characterized in a negative light as being too large, too intrusive in state and local activities and too regulatory in corporative initiatives.
This book attempts to dispel these negative perceptions by offering specific examples regarding the health and safety of the American people, specifically in the areas of the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe.
In addition, we examine a little-known fact regarding the governments (taxpayers) money in technological innovations where the private sector reaps the rewards with little financial returns for the taxpayer. That reinforces one of the themes of this bookthe private sector is dependent on the public sector. In effect, it is a history lesson that needs attention." />
