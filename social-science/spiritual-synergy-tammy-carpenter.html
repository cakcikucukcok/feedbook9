  <title>Spiritual Synergy - Tammy Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Synergy is refreshingly down to earth and easy to read; although small, it packs a punch and has plenty of exercises for the soul.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Coach Wendy Wharton, MA, LPCMH,&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Counseling Center, Middle School&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical Ed &amp; Track &amp; Field&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Synergy offers a workout designed for women who are tired of being weighed down by the weight of their world and are ready to raise their spiritual temperature. No matter where you are in your spiritual journey, author Tammy Carpenter seeks to help you allow God, through His Holy Scripture, to strengthen your spiritual being.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Bible study and guide uses the physical to help you understand the spiritual. Each chapter focuses on losing the weight that is damaging your spirit, and gaining the muscle to strengthen our spiritual being. For instance, a weight that we want to gain is Holiness; this chapter explains reflecting God to others. While working out or lifting weights in a gym the focus is on the mirror to insure each exercise is done completely and correctly. Tammy explains how Christ is our mirror for our spiritual workout. Adding the weight of holiness, causes us to reflect Him releasing Gods love in us and others.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Synergy also considers the weights of discipline, disobedience, carnality, pride, strength, courage, and wisdom among other important topics. As an added bonus, this guide also includes a detox sheet for crisis situations and an alphabetical vitamin verse sheet for daily consumption.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the likeness of a fitness instructor, Tammy Carpenter coaches readers with practical pointers for developing vibrant spiritual health. Spiritual Synergy quickly gets to the heart of trimming fleshly flab and toning heavy hearts. Women, young and old, will profit from this inspiring read.&lt;p&gt;
