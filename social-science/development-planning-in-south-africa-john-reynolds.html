  <title>Development Planning in South Africa - John Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Celebrated as a beacon of
democracy and reconciliation, many people in South Africa continue to live in severe
poverty. Backed by the United Nations Development Programme, the Eastern Cape province
consequently launched an historically ambitious programme – the Provincial Growth
and Development Plan – to eliminate the region’s poverty, unemployment and
inequality over a ten-year period in a radical policy overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the author’s
first-hand engagement working on the programme,&lt;i&gt; Development Planning in
South Africa&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an empirically rich study which draws on strategic-relational
approaches to explore the ways in which this unprecedented challenge was
negotiated, looking at the process by which it was eventually undermined and
obstructed by the South African state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of its kind, the book&amp;nbsp;provides an
indispensable micro-level study with profound implications for how state power
is understood to be organised and expressed in state policy. Relevant beyond
South Africa to policy implementation in both developing and developed states
globally, the book is essential reading for students and scholars of government
studies, political economy, development, policy studies and social movements.&lt;/p&gt;" />
