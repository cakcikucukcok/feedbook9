  <title>50 Ways to Improve Women&#39;s Lives - National Council of Women&#39;s Organizations</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A powerful new call-to-action series was launched with the New York Times bestselling MoveOn&#39;s 50 Ways to Love Your Country. The second book in the series, 50 Ways to Improve Women&#39;s Lives, written by nationally recognized women, is poised to again become an instrument for change and reinvigorate a movement. 50 Ways to Improve Women&#39;s Lives parlays the collective expertise of the National Council of Women&#39;s Organizations&#39; 200 member organizations — which include Planned Parenthood, NOW, League of Women Voters, Code Pink, the AAUW, the National Council of Negro Women, and the YWCA — and features 50 personal, inspiring essays with &quot;Helping Ourselves&quot; and &quot;Call-to-Action&quot; sidebars. Covering subjects as diverse as pay equity, reproductive health, child care, racism, and women in leadership, the book addresses topics that affect women (and all of us!) on a personal and political level, and provides readers with ways to move beyond old arguments and turn inspiration into action. Contributors include Madeline Albright, Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Eleanor Smeal, Hillary Clinton, Congresswomen Maloney, Slaughter, and Pelosi, and many others." />
