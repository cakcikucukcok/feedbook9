  <title>5 Days in May - Andrew Adonis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the May 2010 general election produced a hung parliament, Andrew Adonis and other senior Labour figures sat down for talks with the Liberal Democrat leadership to try to persuade them to govern Britain together in a Lib-Lab coalition. The talks ultimately resulted in failure for Labour, amid recriminations on both sides. Despite calls for him to give his own account of this historic sequence of events, Adonis has until now kept his counsel. Published to coincide with the third anniversary of the general election that produced the first coalition government since the Second World War, 5 Days in May is a remarkable and important insider account of the dramatic negotiations that led to its formation. It also offers the author&#39;s views on what the future holds as the run-up to the next election begins. 5 Days in May presents a unique eyewitness account of a pivotal moment in political history." />
