  <title>Guilty: Hollywood&#39;s Verdict on Arabs After 9/11 - Jack G. Shaheen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Nothing will be the same again.&quot; Americans scarred by the experience of 9/11 often express this sentiment. But what remains the same, argues Jack G. Shaheen, is Hollywood&#39;s stereotyping of Arabs. Before 9/11, Shaheen dissected Hollywood&#39;s equation of Islam and Arabs with violence in Reel Bad Arabs, his comprehensive study of over a thousand movies. Arabs and Muslims, he showed, were used as shorthand for the &quot;Enemy&quot; and the &quot;Other.&quot; In his new book about films made after 9/11, Shaheen finds the same malevolent stereotypes at play. Nearly all of Hollywood&#39;s post-9/11 films legitimize a view of Arabs as stereotyped villains-sheikhs, Palestinians, or terrorists. And this happens in every type of film imaginable: one out of four of the movies profiled here have absolutely nothing to do with the Middle East, yet producers toss in weird, shady, unscrupulous Arabs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Along with an examination of a hundred recent movies, Shaheen addresses the cultural issues at play since 9/11: the government&#39;s public relations campaigns to win &quot;hearts and minds&quot; and the impact of 9/11 on citizens and on the imagination. He suggests that winning the &quot;war on terror&quot; would take shattering the century-old stereotypes of Arabs. He calls for speaking out, for more Arab Americans in the film industry, for fresh films, and for a serious effort on the part of our government to tackle this problem.&lt;/div&gt;" />
