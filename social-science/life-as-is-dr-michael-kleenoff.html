  <title>Life as Is - Dr. Michael Kleenoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Puzzled and disturbed by the religious discord exhibited among disparate
yet deeply devoted believersthe unfading urge of many to find guilt
concerning the Jews; the lack of desire to understand the yearning of blacks;
the ability and the need of most men to hate, to rebuke, and to discard, if not
enjoy the sufferings of, a strangerall these imperfections of humankind led
M. Kleenoff to write this book.
Question after question began to accumulate, forcing the author to
relentlessly seek answers. Not satisfied with half-truths and encountering
many dismissals in a game of zeitgeist interlaced with politically correct
answers, M. Kleenoff confronts these questions with his eyes and heart
wide open in the pursuit of the main taskto finally get to the bottom of
human misdeeds.
The author does not blame anyone; he simply attempts, through a thorough
analysis, to understand why such behavior happens. He then shows the
reader how to be more tolerant, understanding, and humane. Whether it
comes through education, high standards of morality, or simply through
relying on a higher power, the author demonstrates the way to use any of
these roads, if not all, to achieve unity and happiness for all, regardless of
societal dissimilarities." />
