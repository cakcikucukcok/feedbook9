  <title>A Good Month for Murder - Del Quentin Wilber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Del Quentin Wilber tells the inside story of how a homicide squad---a dedicated, colorful team of detectives--does its almost impossible job&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve homicides, three police-involved shootings and the furious hunt for an especially brutal killer--February 2013 was a good month for murder in suburban Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gaining unparalleled access to the homicide unit in Prince George&#39;s County, which borders the nation&#39;s capital, Del Quentin Wilber begins shadowing the talented, often quirky detectives who get the call when a body falls. After a quiet couple of months, all hell breaks loose: suddenly every detective in the squad is scrambling to solve one shooting and stabbing after another. Meanwhile, the entire unit is obsessed with a stone-cold &quot;red ball,&quot; a high-profile case involving a seventeen-year-old honor student attacked by a gunman who kicked down the door to her house and shot her in her bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murder is the police investigator&#39;s ultimate crucible: to solve a killing, a detective must speak for the dead. More than any recent book, &lt;i&gt;A Good Month for Murder &lt;/i&gt;shows what it takes to succeed when the stakes couldn&#39;t possibly be higher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
