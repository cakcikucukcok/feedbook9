  <title>Letters to the Un - Stephen D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If it were not for the media of religions, the television and movies, the fantasies and illusions given to us, would we imagine and create? Would we, each of us, be potential visionaries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Jesus a creative person? I believe him to be very human, very human indeed, much like such phenomenal people, like Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein, of our time. Was also, of his person and story, a situation and circumstance ripe to expound upon and exploit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the message whispered in someones ear and then passed around the room in each ear, until the story changes. Until the last person expounds upon it and the message is exaggerated. So, has the folklore grown and changed, thus supporting a religion? The very religion that supports and dominates our culture is but an illusion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attn: Secretary General of the United Nations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In biblical history there was an innocence and ignorance of medical and biological functions and science. Was there a buyers and traders market of folk medicines and remedies, including human semen? This being a self-applicable fertility potent and stimulant for a woman. To plan her entry into a proposed role of motherhood! Did this potent indirectly guarantee pregnancy? Was biblical Mary a success story of her own making? Through the innocence a success of her own ignorance. And all things given by God, without participation in natural intercourse, a presumption that the child Jesus was the child of God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though without intent to impregnate herself with a creative emolument. Was Jesus then the child of Human Creativity? By this a circumstantial motive, or does creativity imply intent? And thus the uncertainty of the pregnancy of Mary, and the question of fatherhood to the child Jesus leave the predicament of doubts and its judgment to a higher power (God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so by the grace of God, does the Christian civilization relive and act out every human predicament as drama, to a complete and reconcilable understanding? And also to thus, does the United Nations resonate?&lt;/p&gt;
