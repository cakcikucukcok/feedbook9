  <title>When the Dogwoods Bloom - Collin S. Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2030, the United States has gone through a radical change.
Only government agencies have access to the internet and cell phones.
The morality of the country is non-existent. However, it is also a time
of great discoveries in the field of medicine. Yet those are overshadowed
by greed. In all major cities there is a section called Sex Town. A place
where anyone can get anything of a sexual nature and its legal. Streets have
been renamed and moved to make room for these places. The story follows
the investigation of a reporter named Noah Wolfe. He is investigating the
deaths and mutilations of young teenage prostitutes. You will follow him
through his investigation, knowing only what he sees, hears, and thinks." />
