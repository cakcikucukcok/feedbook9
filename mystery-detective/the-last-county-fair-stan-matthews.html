  <title>The Last County Fair - Stan Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1967 when a feud begins that could lead to the death of the one-hundred-year-old Chesterton county fair. When veteran reporter Art James is sent to investigate, he immediately delves into a case that will take him six days and hopefully provide him with a much-coveted feature story byline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bob soon learns that the county is interested in selling the fairgrounds and that there are as many proponents as opponents to the sale. As Art interviews fairgoers, volunteers, and leaders, he unearths a conspiracy to hide the truth from the public until an agreement can be arranged between the county and a trucking firm. While Arts feature articles win him welcome bylines, he becomes even more determined to stop the sham, before it is too late. To complicate matters even further, Art becomes smitten with fair volunteer, Jenny Glen. As the last night of the fair arrives, the future is decidednot just for the fair, but for Art and Jenny as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this compelling story, an investigative reporter on a quest to uncover the truth about the demise of a county fair finds love while uncovering a conspiracy led by greed and deception.&lt;/p&gt;" />
