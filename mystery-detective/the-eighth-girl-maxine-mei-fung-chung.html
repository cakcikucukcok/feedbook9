  <title>The Eighth Girl - Maxine Mei-Fung Chung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optioned by Netflix and a most anticipated book of 2020 from Bustle, The Rumpus, Electric Literature, and LitHub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;The Eighth Girl&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an exquisite exploration of childhood trauma and its impact on the psyche. Part thriller, part character study, I devoured this novel in one sitting, reflecting on each sentence, each passage, and each astute observation of humanity. A true gem!&quot; &amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Wendy Walker, bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Night Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this unsettling, seductive psychological thriller, a young woman with multiple personalities is drawn into London&amp;#8217;s hellish underworld when she becomes entangled with a man who has an abominable secret, for fans of Caroline Kepnes and Clare Mackintosh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One woman, multiple personas.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;But which one is telling the truth?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautiful. Damaged. Destructive. Meet Alexa W&amp;#250;, a brilliant yet&amp;#160;darkly self-aware young woman whose chaotic life is manipulated and controlled by a series of alternate personalities. Only three people know about their existence: her shrink Daniel; her stepmother Anna; and her enigmatic best friend Ella. The perfect trio of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ella gets a job at a high-end gentleman&amp;#8217;s club, she catches the attention of its shark-like owner and is gradually drawn into his inner circle. As Alexa&amp;#8217;s world becomes intimately entangled with Ella&amp;#8217;s, she soon finds&amp;#160;herself the unwitting keeper of a nightmarish secret. With no one to turn to and lives at stake, she follows Ella into London&amp;#8217;s cruel underbelly on a daring rescue mission. Threatened and vulnerable, Alexa will discover whether her multiple personalities are her greatest asset, or her most dangerous obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrifying and breathlessly compulsive, &lt;em&gt;The Eighth Girl&lt;/em&gt; is an omnivorous examination of life with mental illness and the acute trauma of life in a misogynist world. With bingeable prose and a clinician&amp;#8217;s expertise, Chung&amp;#8217;s psychological debut deftly navigates the swirling confluence of identity, innocence, and the impossible fracturing weights that young women are forced to carry, causing us to question:&amp;#160;Does the truth lead to self-discovery, or self-destruction?&lt;/p&gt;" />
