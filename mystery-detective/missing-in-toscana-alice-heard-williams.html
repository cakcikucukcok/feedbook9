  <title>Missing in Toscana - Alice Heard Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emma felt herself perspiring, dizzy, her heart pounding as she was dragged along.  She stumbled, blind with the covering over her head, not sure what   her footing was nor where she was being taken.  Desperately trying to take note of her surroundings,  she counted twenty footsteps, then felt something hard underfoot as the hands grasping her arms shoved her in an abrupt turn to the left.  That meant they  had left the gallery where the Piero della Francescas were displayed for the corridor.  Her entire body trembled with fright.
Alice Heard Williams has done it again!  The heroine of Pensione Anastasia,
American Emma Darling, now an art history teacher at a girls school in London, leads
her students to Tuscany to follow the Piero Trail looking at paintings by Piero della Francesca.  They quickly become witnesses to an art heist, kidnapping and threats of bodily harm.
Emma almost loses her heart to the charming brown-eyed Italian Inspector Luigi Rovere, but her friend Dr. Sam MacGregor arrives from Scotland to restore calm and balance along with help in recovery of the missing masterpiece.  A must read for those who love mystery and art and have been captured by the response to great paintings in Alice Heard Williams previous works." />
