  <title>Truth, Lies, and Revelations - Nicholas Ralph Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When New York resident Scott Myles reads the news in the Martinique newspaper that Susannah Crawford has died, he picks up the telephone and calls his brother, Gavin Harrison. With Susannahs death, Scott is finally free of this deceitful woman who has blackmailed him for the last nine years. Scott can finally reveal to his family that he is alive, not dead as they had presumed.
But Scott harbors a secret that will send him to prison if it becomes common knowledge, and he fears Gavin will despise him when he learns the truth. Even so, the lies and deceit have to end. Scott urges Gavin to visit him in New York, welcoming the chance to explain events that have transpired over the past nine yearsSusannahs manipulation; his homeless life sleeping on the New York streets; and his prison sentence for a crime he didnt commit. Though this punishment eased his guilty conscience, Scott did not intend to become a killer.  
Scott yearns to return to Martinique. He could be arrested, but the urge to be reunited with his family is too strong to resist. Even as he plans, however, a tempestuous storm is brewing with potentially fatal results." />
