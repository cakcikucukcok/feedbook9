  <title>Redemption’S Wrath - D.W. Larsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While out for the evening William Carterell and his sister are attacked by thugs. He is left in a coma; his sister is dragged away screaming, her body found in a dumpster days later. When William finally opens his eyes nearly three years later, he has no idea why he is in a private medical center, nor what has happened to his sister. After recovery, he embarks on a vengeful quest to track down his sisters killers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, halfway across the world, Zhuo Tan toils in vegetable patches, under the watch of her cruel Chinese father, who resents her for being born female. He decides to sell both Zhuo and her younger sister to human traffickers, and the girls are forced to journey across the ocean in a stifling shipping container to America, where they are separated and forced into modern day slavery. As Zhuo struggles to adapt to her new identity, find her sister, and realize freedom, her path eventually crosses with Williams, where their destinies collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Redemptions Wrath&lt;/I&gt; is the poignant story of two vastly different people from opposite ends of the world. They must travel divergent roads towards the same destination to confront their common enemies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
