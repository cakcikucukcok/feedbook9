  <title>The Mystery of the Double Homicide - Mac Kelly Obison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The countdown of the state election is on, and one name is on the lips of every resident of Manzili State, Ms. Amanda Johnson, daughter of the late kingpin of the pharmaceutical industry, Chris Johnson. She is by all standards the favorite candidate for the seat of the governor. Events take a dramatic and unprecedented twist when she and her sentinel are found dead in her home one morning, less than two weeks before the grand election. The entire state is plunged into chaos. Her cousin, who also doubles as the campaign manager, engages the service of Private Detective Tony Justice to team up with the local police to throw some light into the dark and sinister business. Halfway into the inquest, Tony Justice comes up with a lengthy list of enemies, some of which are highly ranked and have valid motives for murder. It appears she stepped on a good number of toes on her way up the political ladder. Complications stick out in every yard as Tony Justice schemes to unravel the mystery. Perhaps one of the most challenging and intriguing cases to come his way, one that would put every iota of his shrewdness and ingenuity to the test. The outcome of this mystery will leave you breathless." />
