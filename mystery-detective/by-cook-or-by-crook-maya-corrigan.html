  <title>By Cook or by Crook - Maya Corrigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take one burned-out city girl. Add a crusty codger, a pinch of gossip, and a dash of romance. Stir in a generous helping of murder and you&#39;ve got the ingredients for one truly delicious mystery...&lt;P&gt;Haunted by the car accident that ended her career as a cookbook publicist, Val Deniston has traded in the chaos of New York City for a quieter life near the Chesapeake Bay. Living with her curmudgeonly grandfather in the tourist town of Bayport is hardly glamorous, but she enjoys working at the Cool Down Café at the local fitness club, and she finally has time to work on her long-planned cookbook. But when one of the club&#39;s patrons is found dead, she&#39;ll have to cook up a scheme to find the killer. As the number of suspects rises like crabs in a bucket, it&#39;s out of the pan and into the fire for Val. If she can&#39;t find the culprit soon, she might as well be chum in the water...&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Includes 8 five-ingredient recipes!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Cozy mystery readers will the love the puzzle and the enjoyable look into this small tourist town by the sea.&quot; -Nancy Coco, author of &lt;I&gt;All Fudged Up&lt;/I&gt;" />
