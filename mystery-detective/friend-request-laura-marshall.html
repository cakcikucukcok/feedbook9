  <title>Friend Request - Laura Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A paranoid single mom is forced to confront the unthinkable act she committed as a desperate teenager in this addictive thriller with a social media twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Maria Weston wants to be friends. But Maria Weston is dead. Isn&#39;t she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  1989. When Louise first notices the new girl who has mysteriously transferred late into their senior year, Maria seems to be everything the girls Louise hangs out with aren&#39;t. Authentic. Funny. Brash. Within just a few days, Maria and Louise are on their way to becoming fast friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  2016. Louise receives a heart-stopping email: Maria Weston wants to be friends on Facebook. Long-buried memories quickly rise to the surface: those first days of their budding friendship; cruel decisions made and dark secrets kept; the night that would change all their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Louise has always known that if the truth ever came out, she could stand to lose everything. Her job. Her son. Her freedom. Maria&#39;s sudden reappearance threatens it all, and forces Louise to reconnect with everyone she&#39;d severed ties with to escape the past. But as she tries to piece together exactly what happened that night, Louise discovers there&#39;s more to the story than she ever knew. To keep her secret, Louise must first uncover the whole truth, before what&#39;s known to Maria--or whoever&#39;s pretending to be her--is known to all." />
