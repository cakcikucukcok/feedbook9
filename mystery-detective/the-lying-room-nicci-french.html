  <title>The Lying Room - Nicci French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One little secret between a married woman, her lover, and a killer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this thrilling standalone from the internationally bestselling author of the Frieda Klein series, a married woman&amp;#8217;s affair with her boss spirals into a dangerous game of chess with the police when she discovers he&amp;#8217;s been&amp;#160;murdered and she clears the crime scene of all evidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should have been just a mid-life fling. A guilty indiscretion that Neve Connolly could have weathered. An escape from twenty years of routine marriage to her overworked husband, and from her increasingly distant children. But when Neve pays a morning-after visit to her lover, Saul, and finds him brutally murdered, their pied-&amp;#224;-terre still heady with her perfume, all the lies she has so painstakingly stitched together threaten to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After scrubbing clean every trace of her existence from Saul&amp;#8217;s life&amp;#8212;and death&amp;#8212;Neve believes she can return to normal, shaken but intact. But she can&amp;#8217;t get out of her head the one tormenting question: &lt;em&gt;what was she forgetting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation into the slaying could provide the answer. It&amp;#8217;s brought Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Hitching, and Neve&amp;#8217;s worst fears, to her door. But with every new lie, every new misdirection to save herself, Neve descends further into the darkness of her betrayal&amp;#8212;and into more danger than she ever imagined. Because Hitching isn&amp;#8217;t the only one watching Neve. So is a determined killer who&amp;#8217;s about to make the next terrifying move in a deadly affair&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
