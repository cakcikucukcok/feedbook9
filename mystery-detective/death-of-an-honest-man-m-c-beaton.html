  <title>Death of an Honest Man - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nobody loves an honest man--or that was what police sergeant Hamish Macbeth tried to tell newcomer Paul English. Paul had moved to a house in Cnothan, a sour village on Hamish&#39;s beat, where he immediately started to stir up outrage among his neighbors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Paul first attended church in Lochdubh and told the minister, Mr. Wellington, that his sermons were boring. He then told tweedy Mrs. Wellington that she was too fat and should set a better example in these days of increasing obesity. Angela Brody was told her detective stories were pap for the masses and that she should write real literature instead. He accused Hamish of having dyed his fiery red hair. He told Jessie Currie--who compulsively repeats all the last words of her twin sister--that she needed psychiatric help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;I speak as I find,&quot; he bragged. A refrain of &quot;I could kill that man,&quot; could be heard from Lochdubh to Cnothan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  And someone did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now Hamish is faced with a bewildering array of suspects, this time without the services of his clumsy policeman, Charlie, who resigned from the force after one too many confrontations with Hamish&#39;s incompetent boss, Chief Inspector Blair. But can Hamish find the killer on his own?" />
