of jealous and hateful pursuers of her life and she must quickly learn&lt;br /&gt;
to defend herself in the art of swordsmanship. However, even in the&lt;br /&gt;
midst of danger and tribulation through repeated captures, Raja is&lt;br /&gt;
determined to ful ll her duties as princess and works to bring justice&lt;br /&gt;
and redemption to others around her with torn pasts and hardships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
