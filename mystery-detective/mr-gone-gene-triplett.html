      <meta name="description" content="Jack Ritter was once the juvenile delinquent scourge of Oklahoma City, specializing in grand theft auto and one of the best in that criminal line of work. When the cops were getting too close and life with a drunken, widowed mother and a wild little half brother were starting to take their toll, hed fled to start a new life elsewhere as a straight citizen. But ten years later, in the awful spring of 1995 when his hometown is in turmoil in the wake of Murrah Building bombing, an unrelated murder and his own gnawing guilt have pulled him back, forcing him to infiltrate a ring of thieves thats thriving while law enforcement officials are distracted by the worst terrorist attack ever perpetrated on US soil. Ritters mission is more personaltracking down the killer of someone once close to himsomeone he felt hed selfishly abandoned a long time ago." />
