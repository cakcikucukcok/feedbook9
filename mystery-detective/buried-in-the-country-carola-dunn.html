  <title>Buried in the Country - Carola Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After many years working around the world for an international charity in the late 1960s, Eleanor Trewynn has retired to the relative quiet of a small town in Cornwall. But her quiet life is short-lived when, due to her experience, the Commonwealth Relations Office reaches out to her to assist in a secret conference that is to take place in a small hotel outside the historical village of Tintagel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, her niece, Detective Sargent Megan Pencarrow, is investigating the disappearance of a local solicitor when she is assigned to help provide security for the conference. Two African students, refugees from Ian Smith&#39;s Rhodesia, arrive for the conference, escorted by Megan&#39;s bête noire from Scotland Yard. They are followed by two mysterious and sinister Londoners, whose allegiances and connections to the conference and the missing solicitor are unclear. With a raging storm having trapped everyone in the hotel, the stage is set for murder, and it&#39;s up to Eleanor and Megan to uncover the truth before more lives are lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
