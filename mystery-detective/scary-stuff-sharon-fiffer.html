  <title>Scary Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Antique picker Jane Wheel has always loved old stuff, from vintage salt and pepper shakers to other families&#39; old photos and orphaned Bakelite buttons, and she can&#39;t really explain why. But she makes a living out of it, searching high and low at estate sales and antique shops and reselling her finds to other collectors. At least, it&#39;s half a living---she makes the other half as an associate to a private detective, because she&#39;s just as talented at digging up secrets as antiques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While visiting her brother for the first time in years, Jane&#39;s fascinated by a story of mistaken identity: On three occasions, someone has accused him of swindling them on eBay, only to realize he&#39;s not the right guy. Even though he doesn&#39;t see the point, she wants to look into it. Then back at home one of her parents&#39; friends is attacked, leading Jane to vow to get to the bottom of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, Jane suddenly has two cases, both edging a little too close to her loved ones for comfort, because one thing&#39;s for sure---whenever family gets wrapped up in your personal business, it&#39;s bound to be some scary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;" />
