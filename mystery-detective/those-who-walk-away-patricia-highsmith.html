  <title>Those Who Walk Away - Patricia Highsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Ray Garrett, a wealthy young American living in Europe, is grieving over the death of his wife Peggy. Ray is at a loss for why she would take her own life, but Peggy’s father Ed Coleman, a painter, has no such uncertainty—he blames Ray completely. Late one night in Rome, Coleman shoots Ray at point-blank range. He thinks he’s had his revenge, but Ray survives and follows Coleman and his wealthy girlfriend to Venice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Venice, it happens again: Coleman attacks his loathed son-in-law, dumping him into the cold waters of the laguna. Ray survives thanks to the help of a boatman, and this time he goes into hiding, living in a privately rented room under a fake name. So begins an eerie game of cat-and-mouse. Coleman wants vengeance, Ray wants a clear conscience, and the police want to solve the mystery of what happened to the missing American. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Ray and Coleman stalk each other through the narrow streets and canals, the hotels and bars of the beguiling city, &lt;EM&gt;Those Who Walk Away&lt;/EM&gt; simmers with violence and unease. Originally published in 1967, this is vintage Highsmith.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
