  <title>The Truth About Love - Julie Anne Wack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For as long as she could remember, Gertrude Kueshner had never wanted anything but to create beautiful hats that would one day be worn by the high society ladies of New York City. She endured the teasing of her four brothers and the lectures of her disapproving father, an immigrant who published a small socialist newspaper and thought little of the rich and fashionable society people of the big, bustling city. That was until she had the misfortune to meet a handsome, cynical detective. Alexander Marshall was the most exasperating man she had ever met, and Gertrude wanted nothing more to do with him despite the strange fluttering sensations she felt when he was near. But then two murders occur near Gertrude&#39;s father&#39;s print shop, and she finds herself once again in the company of the determined detective. When the happiness of Gertrude&#39;s large, loving family is threatened, Gertrude makes up her mind to find whoever was responsible for the murders, even if it means risking her own life, as well as her heart." />
