  <title>Snitches ‘N’ B*Tches - Jimmy James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1972 when Jimmy James meets Vito Ciro on a basketball court. Vito, born into a New York mob family, quickly becomes a bad influence on Jimmy, who is destined to receive an athletic scholarship. As Jimmy becomes friends with Vito, he has no idea that his life has changed forever with that one decision.
Several weekends later, Jimmys uncle shows him his FBI badge and tells fascinating stories about organized crime. Despite warnings from his father, an already intrigued Jimmy soon becomes immersed in a lifestyle not intended for the faint-hearted. After he sets out on a dangerous path lined with drugs, fast women, hot cars, and gangs, Jimmy encounters a variety of characters that eventually lead him to wonder who he can trust, even within a family where loyalty is supposed to matter. As he ponders his life choices and contemplates his next move, now only time will tell if Jimmy will shun the lures of his past or continue on the same misguided path.
Snitches n B*tches shares the tale of one mans lifelong saga through organized crime and drugs as he learns life lessons the hard way in a cold, harsh world where no one is safe." />
