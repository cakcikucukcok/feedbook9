  <title>Sherlock Holmes&#39; Last Case - Robert D&#39;Artagnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Everyone knew that Sherlock Holmes perished in a titanic struggle with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls in the year 1891.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At least they thought they knew that. Until...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Until some three years later he suddenly reappeared in London, alive and well, the same old Sherlock Holmes...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or...was he?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is only one of the questions examined in the pages of Sherlock Holmes Last Case.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	This manuscript among the recently discovered effects of Doctor John H. Watson, as edited by novelist Robert DArtagnan, gives us a description of what may have been Sherlock Holmes final adventure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That adventure describes intrigue and a clever scheme to discredit an internationally known figure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But it involves more than that. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unexpectedly Holmes own worst enemy in some ways would suddenly seem to be himself...would seem so indeed... were it not for the ominous presence of Colonel Moriarty seeking vengeance for the death of his late brother. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then, for Sherlock Holmes, everything is at risk ...reputation, self-esteem and life itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;The newsletter of the prestigious and long-established SHERLOCK HOLMES SOCIETY OF LONDON says this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes Last Case&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by Robert DArtagnan (Xlibris, &lt;u&gt;www.xlibris.com,&lt;/u&gt; $29.69 hardback, $19.54 trade paperback), takes Holmes and Watson to Vienna to meet Sigmund Freud, and gives a sensational new account of what really happened during the Great Hiatus - but its not a re-run of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Seven-per-Cent Solution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt;  The year is 1908:  At Martha Freuds request Holmes investigates her husbands peculiar behaviour, and Freud helps him to solve the mystery of Reichenbach and the years that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Freuds persecutor, we discover, is someone who will later have a profound effect on the history of Austria, and indeed of the world.  Its heady stuff, excitingly told&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---- excerpted from the book review by Roger Johnson, Editor of the Newsletter, who also calls &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes Last Case&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a rattling good read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
