  <title>The Last Place - Laura Lippman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Laura Lippman&amp;#8217;s Tess Monaghan investigates five cold case murders, she doesn&amp;#8217;t expect the investigation to&amp;#160;become personal&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tess Monaghan agrees to look into a series of unsolved homicides that date back over the past six years despite the fact that the assignment originates from a troubling source: wealthy Baltimore benefactor Luisa O&amp;#8217;Neal, who was both instrumental in launching Tess&amp;#8217;s present career and intimately connected with the murder of Tess&amp;#8217;s former boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the suspicion that each death was the result of domestic violence, nothing else seems to connect them. Five lives&amp;#8212;four women, one man&amp;#8212;ended in various ways. The only thing the five cases seem to have is that they are now ice cold. Tess&amp;#8217; search for the connecting threads takes her beyond the Charm City limits and into dangerously unfamiliar territory. With the help of a police officer obsessed with bringing a murderer down, she follows scant leads into the remotest corners of Maryland, where a psychopath can hide as easily in the fabric of a tiny, rough-hewn fishing community as in the alleys and shadows of bustling Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she strays far from everything that&amp;#8217;s familiar and safe in her life, Tess is suddenly cast into a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with an ingenious slayer who changes identities as often and effortlessly as clothing. But at last, a single link to the murders emerges. Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s Tess.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
