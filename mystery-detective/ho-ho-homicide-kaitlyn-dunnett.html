  <title>Ho-Ho-Homicide - Kaitlyn Dunnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Business  is booming at the Scottish Emporium in Moosetookalook, Maine, and Liss  MacCrimmon Ruskin couldn&#39;t be happier--or busier. A romantic getaway at a  rustic Christmas tree farm is just what she needs. But the property&#39;s  mysterious past has her feeling less than merry.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liss is  surprised when an old friend from high school asks her to spend a week  at the Christmas tree farm she recently inherited from a great-uncle.  Realizing it would be the perfect chance for her and her husband Dan to  get away from work, Liss happily accepts the offer and packs her bags  for the tiny town of New Boston. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon their arrival, Liss and  Dan are greeted by a ramshackle farmhouse and unfriendly townsfolk. It&#39;s  hardly the idyllic vacation locale they&#39;d hoped for, especially when  needling neighbors start raising questions about the farm&#39;s dark  history. Who was the man whose body was found neatly netted in a  shipment of Scotch pine? Why did the owner vanish into thin air? And why  are the trees growing so close together, forming a maze more twisted  than a Celtic knot? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rumors pile up faster than snowdrifts in  a blizzard, and as Liss starts un-wrapping the truth, she discovers  something even more scandalous than murder hiding beneath the town&#39;s  humdrum fa&amp;ccedil;ade. When a series of &quot;accidents&quot; strikes the farm, she&#39;ll  have to spring into action faster than a Highland Fling to find the  killer who&#39;s been lurking among the pines--before she ends up in a pine  box herself.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Kaitlyn Dunnett and her Liss MacCrimmon Mysteries!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vampires, Bones, And Treacle Scones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Spooky.  .  .Cozy fans are in for a Halloween treat.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bagpipes, Brides, And Homicides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fans of Scottish lore or bookstore mysteries like Lorna Barrett&#39;s and Carolyn Hart&#39;s will enjoy this one.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scotched&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A satisfying entry in the series.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This well-plotted novel provides pure entertainment.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Wee Christmas Homicide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The blend of romance and cozy mystery will please lovers of all things Scottish.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scone Cold Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Enjoyable.  .  .vivid descriptions of Maine during mud season and a quirky cast of characters lift this cozy.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kilt Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;If you have an affinity for all things Scottish, this is the book for you.&quot; --Deadly Pleasures" />
