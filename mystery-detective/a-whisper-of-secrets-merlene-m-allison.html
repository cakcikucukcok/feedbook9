  <title>A Whisper of Secrets - Merlene M. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ramona Rain Rainey Moses has known that she is different since her first day of school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quiet, introverted, and brilliant young woman, she excels in school and in college. But the bullying and misperceptions that taint her everyday life have grown to be more than she can stand, so diploma in hand, she returns to her beloved home in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains to build a new life for herself. There, cloaked in solitude and her mysterious mountain ways, she carefully gathers a small community of like-minded mountain folk. Together, they form a new kind of family, safe and strong in the wilderness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite Raineys best attempts to protect them from the terrors of the outside world, strangers occasionally wander into her secretive worldand she deals with these unfortunate intruders accordingly. And on the day when four men with evil intentions attack the camp, they soon learn that even though they have eluded the police, there is no hope for escape from justicethis time, at Raineys hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mountains, they will soon learn that there are fates worse than prisonand even worse than death. When the sun goes down in the deep, wild mountains, everything you thought you knew becomes a deadly mystery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainey and her friends will do what it takes to protect their own, and legend has it that the haint who terrorizes locals is actually one of her strange new kinor is it something even more sinister? &lt;/p&gt;" />
