  <title>The Ballad of Mo and G - Billy Keane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Even though I wished it was me she was married to, I was still hoping Mo would be happy ever after with Dermo Olsen. That was until the violence started. I loved her that much. Can you believe that?&quot; Welcome to an unnamed town in the southwest of Ireland, where Mo and G have what could loosely be described as a dysfunctional relationship. Between the sex (real and imagined), beatings (very real), and pining after Mo (very, very real), there&#39;s barely time for G to figure out how to escape his arch-enemies, the Olsens - or their bloodthirsty Dobermans - for good. G is plagued by nightmares, and sometimes tries to do the right thing. Very occasionally, he succeeds. In The Ballad of Mo and G, Billy Keane tackles lives lived on the edge with a sharp yet compassionate eye, and a biting black humour. An assured report from Ireland&#39;s dark, post-boom underbelly by a supremely talented storyteller." />
