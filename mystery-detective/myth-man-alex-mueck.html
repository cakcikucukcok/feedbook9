  <title>Myth Man - Alex Mueck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A serial killer is on a killing spree of the religious in New York City, and a seasoned police detective is the only one who can stop him.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He is a lion, and the religious cattle his prey. A serial killer is focused on severing religions stranglehold on humanity in order to cleanse the world of superstitions, religious leaders, and gullible citizens. Myth Man is preparing to unleash an unholy vengeance. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Dominick Presto is one of New York Citys finest police detectives. While the obese Presto battles prejudices from within his own department, he matches his wits with one of the most sensationalized killer in the citys history. But Myth Man fears no one. And the murder spree begins. Hailed as the Son of Satan by the local newspapers, Myth Man uses hidden contacts and disguises as he moves from victim to victim, while Presto attempts to decipher his psychotic mind in order to predict his next move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serial killer has a plan. And soon the world will come to know him, celebrate him, and perhaps worship himfor he is Myth Man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
