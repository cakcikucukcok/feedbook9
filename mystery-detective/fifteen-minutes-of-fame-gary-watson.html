As his workload mounts and his personal life becomes even more stressful, Clint uncovers information about the killings that brings him to a choice. Does he remain merely a reporter who covers the news, or does he get involved and end up making the news? His career, his relationships, resolution of the crimes and even life and death are on the line as Clint struggles to make his decision.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
