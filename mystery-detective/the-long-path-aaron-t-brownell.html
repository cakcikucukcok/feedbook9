  <title>The Long Path - Aaron T. Brownell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There are times when you get more than you expect. Chris Anderson is having one of those times. After receiving an intriguing email, the unassuming college professor jets off to Europe to inspect a French manuscript reported to reference the Knights Templar. Quickly drawn into the research, the obsessive Templar scholar realizes that the enigma before him is actually the start of a quest. Unwilling to let go, he heads out across Europe chasing one clue after another, and slowly puzzling out the path that leads to the hiding place of the lost Templar treasure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Shadowed at every step by a ruthless assassin; Anderson follows the twisting path that somehow bring him back to North America. With a small group of good friends in support, Professor Anderson follows the path to its end, and the most unlikely of hiding places. The assassin, seeing the group has located the treasure, confronts Anderson and his friends in a bid to seize it for himself. The small town treasure hunters must outwit their adversary or end up casualties of the chase. But, if they do survive, what will they do with the treasure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Starting in the restrained world of academia and moving out into the hurried locals of Europe and America, The Long Path follows a puzzle built by generations of loyal Guardians. Anderson stands and protects the past in a climax fitting of any Knights Templar battle.&lt;/P&gt;" />
