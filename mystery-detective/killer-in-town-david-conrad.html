  <title>Killer in Town - David Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An unknown sniper is systematically killing the prominent men of
Franklin, Illinois. No one knows who will be next. Sheriff Marcus Dixon
and Detective Mary Ellen Selvedge must catch the killer, and they must do
it with little help from the local police or from anyone outside. Its 1936 in
the heart of the Great Depression. Th ere are plenty of potential suspects-
-men who have lost their jobs, had their homes foreclosed, are broke, or
who are just plain angry and desperate. Th en, there are the communists,
anarchists, and fascists, all of whom are becoming more active in the
Depression.
Marcus and Mary Ellen are in love, but they must put their marriage plans
on hold until they can catch the killer. Th eir investigations take them
from the homes of the rich and powerful in Franklin to a miserable shack
in shantytown, even to a training camp for the German American Bund.
Every new shooting by the sniper raises the levels of fear and panic in the
people of Franklin, and Marcus and Mary Ellen must bring the killer to
justice before the town comes apart." />
