He arranged an art theft to cover a debt--only somebody swiped the paintings from his crew. Now the insurance company wants him to investigate his own art theft; the local bookie wants his money; his crew in the neighborhood is targeted by a sniper; both the mob and the cops think he&#39;s the shooter; and his girlfriend split and stuck him with four cats that are redecorating his apartment. Six-foot-six Tommy nimbly navigates his troubles and Brooklyn with the help of tantric yoga, his father&#39;s aphorisms, and a comely masseuse. But the question remains: do good things happen to good people? The answer lurks in a fiery Brooklyn scrap yard.&lt;/p&gt;" />
