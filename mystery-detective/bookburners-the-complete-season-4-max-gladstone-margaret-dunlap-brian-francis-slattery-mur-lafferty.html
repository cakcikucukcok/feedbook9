  <title>Bookburners: The Complete Season 4 - Max Gladstone, Margaret Dunlap, Brian Francis Slattery, Mur Lafferty...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supernatural&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; in a fast-paced, kickass character driven novel chock-full of magic, mystery, and mayhem, written collaboratively by a team of some of the best writers working in fantasy.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Magic is real . . . and hungry.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Everything in the Bookburners’ lives falls into two categories: Before London and After London. Before London, things were strange, sure, but After London . . . “strange” doesn’t even begin to describe it. Magic is everywhere—and the Bookburners can only be in one place at a time. 
&lt;br&gt;
Having cut ties with the Vatican, the members of the former Team Three are a little at a loss. Their old roles don’t feel right anymore; their old job seems almost quaint, considering how much magic flourishes in plain sight. But with the return of an old enemy, they find a renewed purpose. And this time, they know that the only thing they can depend on in this world is each other. 
&lt;br&gt;
Fans of &lt;i&gt;Supernatural&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The X-Files&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; will love this epic urban fantasy. Originally presented serially in 10 episodes, this edition contains all installments of Bookburners Season 4. This is a novel co-written by Max Gladstone, Brain Francis Slattery, Mur Lafferty, and Andrea Phillips.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Bookburners series:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;“Sheer enormous fun!” —Naomi Novik, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling Temeraire series
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bookburners is worth getting hooked on!&quot; —Pop. Edit. Lit. blog
&lt;br&gt;“Recommended for those looking for a breezy, entertaining and exciting fantasy read.” —&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&quot;As much fun as binge-watching a full season of a Showtime series.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;“Highly recommended for urban fantasy fans (think: Cassandra Clare&#39;s City of Bones combined with the Indiana Jones movies).” —&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;" />
