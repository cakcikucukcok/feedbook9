  <title>The Heart Behind the Mask - Nancy S. Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Greyson Hart has been framed for the murder of her second husband by her ex-husband, Clayton.  Greyson knows that she is next unless she takes control of the situation.  Not planning on allowing her self to be the next victim of Clayton&#39;s evil, Greyson fakes her own violent death then goes into hiding. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alone and badly injured from the faked car accident, Greyson hides out in an abandoned warehouse and then along the treacherous banks of the Cape Fear River.  Eventually, with the help of two trusted friends, she escapes to the North Carolina Mountains where she lives as a near hermit for several years.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During her years in the mountains, Greyson faces many battles as she struggles to make a new life for her self on the isolated mountain top.  But Greyson has to endure many hardships.  Not only does she have to battle the normal hardships of everyday mountain life but those hardships are compounded by the adversity of isolation, constant loneliness, and unusually harsh weather.  Her days are hard enough but Greyson&#39;s nights are even longer as she battles the emotional demons that have also long plagued her.  Over time, she begins to come to terms with these demons but still longs to be free and to finally find someone with which she can make a life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just when Greyson thinks she has battled every kind of hardship that life can throw her way, Detective O&#39;Connor finds out where she is hiding and comes to find her.  But unknown to Greyson he is coming not to arrest her but rather to win her heart.
