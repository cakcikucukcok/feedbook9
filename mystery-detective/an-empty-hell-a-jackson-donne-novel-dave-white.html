  <title>An Empty Hell: A Jackson Donne Novel - Dave White</title>

Under the guise of Joe Tennant, Donne has been recovering &amp;#151; and even enjoying his life up north. Until one of the few friends he&amp;#8217;s made goes missing. Meanwhile, back in New Jersey, someone is killing ex-cops &amp;#151; the ones who Donne used to work with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Terrified Donne is committing the murders, a former colleague hires private investigator Matt Herrick to track down New Jersey&amp;#8217;s most famous fugitive. Herrick agrees and almost immediately, there&amp;#8217;s a bounty on his head. The closer Herrick gets to tracking Donne down, the more dangerous the case becomes. And once Donne and Herrick cross paths, the two cases tie together, and Donne realizes he must go back to the life he left behind. Because the past has come calling, and if Donne does face up to it, he and Herrick could lose everything, including their lives.&lt;/div&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>An Empty Hell: A Jackson Donne Novel - Dave White</i></b> | AN EMPTY HELL was my introduction to Jackson Donne, and I'm definitely going back for more. Featuring two great protagonists, with the addition of high school basketball coach-slash-PI Matt Herrick, HELL is a slow burn of a thriller, but you never feel like the pace is lacking. Each chapter drives you forward to the next. Visceral and engaging.<br /><b><i>An Empty Hell: A Jackson Donne Novel: White, Dave ...</i></b> | White begins his novel slowly, like the bucolic Vermont setting where Donne cuts wood and drinks craft beer. But once the characters are all in place "An Empty Hell" rockets through torture, explosions and unexpected revelations, ending with Donne confronting the evil that he has done and the greater evil that pursues him.<br /><b><i>An Empty Hell: A Jackson Donne Novel - Kindle edition by ...</i></b> | And with that, An Empty Hell, the latest installment in the Jackson Donne series from Derringer Award-winning author Dave White, is off and running.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>An Empty Hell: A Jackson Donne Novel - Dave White</a> </h3></p><hr/>
