  <title>The Parchman Preacher - Michael Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Martha, Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist, Satan, and Jesus are key figures in this 1950s good-versus-evil suspense allegory of Christ&#39;s beginning ministry. Twists, turns, and suspense make a preacher&#39;s murder mystery chilling. A tantalizing murder mystery filled with chilling explorations of hypocrisy, true faith, and small-town secrets. It&#39;s about sin and redemption. It&#39;s about the search for truth, in both the physical and spiritual realms. And it&#39;s all wrapped up in a puzzle that keeps even skeptics on their toes. Underneath it all is an allegory of Christ&#39;s ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I highly recommend The Parchman Preacher short in length, but deep in meaning, I could hardly put this book down.&quot; -Linda Lacour Hobar, author of The Mystery of History series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Michael Thompson has brought to life the Mississippi of my youth, complete with small town scandals, murders, prison, and the powerful southern female. Sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy a glass of sweet tea and a romping good tale.&quot; -Carolyn Haines, author of the on-going Sarah Booth Delaney mystery series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you love southern gossips and party lines and communal mail, you&#39;ll feel right at home in Solo, Mississippi biblical in its proportions, with a revolving Episcopal pulpit, a moonshine-swilling postmaster and a murdering villain. Jesus, Martha, Mary, John the Baptist, Satan-what a place.&quot; -Rheta Grimsley Johnson, author of Enchanted Evening Barbie &amp; the Second Coming, and other books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In The Parchman Preacher, Michael Thompson has written a true southern story of tragedy, darkness, and destiny with unpredictable twists and turns and genuine characters that provide comic relief in the midst of malevolent schemes a page turner we loved it.&quot; -Janet and Reverend John Sartelle, author of What Christian Parents Should Know About Infant Baptism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Parchman Preacher penetrates the facades of southern cultural Christianity to take us to the true gospel There is no Savior but Jesus and no salvation from the judgment of God but faith in Christ alone.&quot; -Richard L. Pratt, Th.D. theologian, author of several books, including Designed For Dignity: What God Has Made It Possible For You To Be, and founder of Third Millennium Ministries, Orlando, FL.&lt;/p&gt;

A tantalizing murder mystery filled with chilling explorations of hypocrisy, true faith, and small-town secrets.
