  <title>The Fire Child - S.K. Tremayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE PERFECT HUSBAND. THE PERFECT STEPSON. THE PERFECT LIE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Tremayne...does a terrific job of building suspense until events reach their climax in the midst of a violent storm.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When Rachel marries dark, handsome David, everything seems to fall into place. Swept from single life in London to the beautiful Carnhallow House in Cornwall, she gains wealth, love, and an affectionate stepson, Jamie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But then Jamie&#39;s behavior changes, and Rachel&#39;s perfect life begins to unravel. He makes disturbing predictions, claiming to be haunted by the specter of his late mother - David&#39;s previous wife. Is this Jamie&#39;s way of punishing Rachel, or is he far more traumatized than she thought?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As Rachel starts digging into the past, she begins to grow suspicious of her husband. Why is he so reluctant to discuss Jamie&#39;s outbursts? And what exactly happened to cause his ex-wife&#39;s untimely death, less than two years ago? As summer slips away and December looms, Rachel begins to fear there might be truth in Jamie&#39;s words:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;You will be dead by Christmas.&quot;" />
