  <title>The Merlin Legacy - Jeane Heimberger Candido</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Karamo Bohannon, who had been given asylum from the war-torn Congo to become a top echelon professor at a Big Conference university, is found dead in his office on the last day of his contract. Less than twenty-four hours before, he had announced his candidacy for a hotly-contested seat in the U.S. Congress. Was his death due to natural causes resulting from a lifetime of Type A stress on a depleted body and soul? Or was it murder? 
Before the question could be answered, all trace of the man--his past, his present, and his projected future had not been just redacted from the world-wide cyber memory banks, but completely erased. All university web pages, faculty rosters, and catalog listings had been sterilized--there was no listing of any man by that name having held an esteemed teaching Chair for ten years. The scrubbing extended to all pertinent government vital statistics in all agencies and bureaus. The man was not just mortally dead, he virtually had never been born. 
&quot;In addition to being a cracking good techno-murder mystery, Jeane Heimberger Candido&#39;s newest book affords what prestigious editor John W. Campbell of &#39;Astounding Magazine&#39; later &#39;Analog&#39; called &#39;a diagonal slice through society&#39;s culture of the day.&#39; This book ought to be a shot across the bow. If you think the world she describes does not actually exist, the politicos and pundits have done their job. Jeane&#39;s book adds another level of complexity to the world as it is. Read between the lines.&quot; 
H.J. Popowski, Author &amp; Historian 
&quot;I was one of the first fans allowed to read this mystery. It was well thought out for timeline and characters. I enjoyed especially the insurance investigators. I read until my eyes were tired not wanting to put the book down more than once.&quot;
