  <title>Beyond Cantua Creek - Elvin C. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Cantua Creek&lt;/i&gt;, a seasoned political insider with White House experience, shares some fascinating experiences during the Nixon Administration, including the Nixon-Brezhnev White House Summit Conference.&lt;p&gt;
During the Iron Curtain era, Elvin Bell led several intelligence missions into Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, in addition to later
serving two special assignments in the White House and completing a tour in the Pentagon during the Ronald Reagan administration. He
utilizes his political experience to provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the power structure that existed during the Nixon
administrationa foundation that allowed a secretary to appoint her own boyfriend to be secretary of the interior. As he shares the
contents of startling conversations and meetings with Soviet President Leonid Ilych Brezhnev, Nixons secretary Rosemary Woods, Hollywood producer Sam Peckinpah, and scores of other notables, Bell captures the drama that escaped media attention and
instead thrived behind the walls of the White House and elsewhere.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Beyond Cantua Creek&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling compilation that will encourage lively discussions about politics, a presidential
administration that will never be forgotten, and the eccentricities of those who once ruled Hollywood." />
