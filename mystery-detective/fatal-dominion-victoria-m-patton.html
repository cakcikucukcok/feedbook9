  <title>Fatal Dominion - Victoria M. Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A prominent political figure is found tortured and dumped near a popular teenage hang out on the outskirts of Chicago; thrusting Lieutenant Damien Kaine and Detective Joe Hagan into the world of Illinois politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Lockhart, Chicago&amp;#39;s favorite son and candidate to be the next Governor, becomes the prime suspect in the killing. He is backed by his wealthy family who will stop at nothing to clear their name. Damien&amp;#39;s family ties to the Lockharts only complicate matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the bodies begin to pile up, the evidence shows a connection to a five-year-old unsolved case, Damien and Joe had at the 17th precinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure of how far the corruption goes up their own chain of command, Damien and Joe are leery of who to trust. It becomes clear someone is trying to clean house and tie up loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one of the State&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest men, FBI, and the VCU putting pressure on Damien to close this case, he finds himself having to go outside the rules just to get witness statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as Damien and Joe get closer to the real meaning of the gruesome string of murders that seem to have a strong connection to the Lockharts, Damien is not only pitted against his own family, but he and Joe now have targets on their backs. Can they find the real reason for all the deaths, or will those targets land them permanently removed from the case?&lt;/p&gt;" />
