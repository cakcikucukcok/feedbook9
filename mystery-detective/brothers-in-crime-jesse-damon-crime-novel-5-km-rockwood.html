      <meta name="description" content="The cops say surveillance video doesn&#39;t lie. But could they be mistaken?  &lt;P&gt; After nearly twenty years in prison, Jesse Damon is just trying to make it on parole. But nothing comes easy. The cops say they have a video of him breaking into an ATM. He&#39;s in trouble at work over a toxic chemical spill. A runaway wife shows up on his doorstep, dead broke and needing somewhere to stay. And his sometimes-girlfriend Kelly seems to have met someone new. Sydney. At an AA meeting, of all places. When Jesse goes to Sydney&#39;s office and finds his dead body, he&#39;s pretty sure the guy has been murdered. And that he will be the prime suspect." />
