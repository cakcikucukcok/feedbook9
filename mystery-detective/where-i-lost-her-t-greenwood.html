  <title>Where I Lost Her - T. Greenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spellbinding. I loved everything about &lt;i&gt;Where I Lost Her&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Mary Kubica, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Good Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her page-turning new novel, T. Greenwood follows one woman&#39;s journey through heartbreak and loss to courage and resolve, as she searches for the truth about a missing child. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight years ago, Tess and Jake were considered a power couple of the New York publishing world--happy, in love, planning a family. Failed fertility treatments and a heartbreaking attempt at adoption have fractured their marriage and left Tess edgy and adrift. A visit to friends in rural Vermont throws Tess&#39;s world into further chaos when she sees a young, half-dressed child in the middle of the road, who then runs into the woods like a frightened deer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire town begins searching for the little girl. But there are no sightings, no other witnesses, no reports of missing children. As local police and Jake point out, Tess&#39;s imagination has played her false before. And yet Tess is compelled to keep looking, not only to save the little girl she can&#39;t forget but to salvage her broken heart as well.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending her trademark lyrical prose with a superbly crafted and suspenseful narrative, &lt;i&gt;Where I Lost Her &lt;/i&gt;is a gripping, haunting novel from a remarkable storyteller." />
