  <title>The Dream App - Faheem Najiy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This original work of fiction is replete with plenty of soulfully constructed images and intrigue. Additionally, it will introduce young characters who interact with contemporary themes with a design on arousing the curiosity and inciting the unbridled sense of wonder lying within us all. The familiar question in our American vernacular that will drive this and subsequent adventures of the young protagonist is, Well, do you know what they say? 
This rhetorical question opens the doors for disseminating timely, mundane, and spiritual tidbits of wisdom that, through human experience, have stood the test of time. Call them axioms, adages, or just plain and simple insight into the way life truly works, even as we allow their anecdotal audacity to guide and protects us from our negative conclusions; we can also delight in knowing that their commissions among us are infinite. 
Like all stories about life, the principle players in these tales are good versus evil, and in this very troubling time in the history of our species, where social media has created a Frankenstein of asocial behavior, there is a moral clause that hopefully compels every reader to see themselves and begin to think and to feel and learn while being entertained. And so it begins." />
