  <title>She&#39;s Not There - Mary-Ann Tirone Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Poppy Rice&#39;s second venture, the smart, outspoken FBI agent&#39;s vacation is rudely interrupted by a sinister murder &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FBI agent Poppy Rice is, rather unwillingly, taking time off to recuperate from injuries sustained on the job. A few days into her ill-conceived vacation on Block Island with Joe, her sometime-lover and soul mate, she happens upon a corpse dumped in the middle of the road.&lt;br&gt;The body of the victim, a young girl from a summer camp for overweight teenagers, is painfully contorted, her face frozen in a death scream. There are no visible wounds and the cause of death is a mystery. Although Poppy is no stranger to gruesome scenes, she is so disturbed by the murder that she can&#39;t help but defy her orders to rest. Then, just as she begins poking around, another body is found in the same condition as the first; this time, the pathologist reveals another similarity--the eardrums of both girls were ruptured.&lt;br&gt;Now Poppy must get to the killer before the killer gets to any more girls. With no clue as to the murderer&#39;s method or motive, she&#39;s going to need all the help she can get. But in the close-knit, tight-lipped Block Island community, secrets are kept--even deadly ones, in Mary-Ann Tirone Smith&#39;s &lt;i&gt;She&#39;s Not There&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
