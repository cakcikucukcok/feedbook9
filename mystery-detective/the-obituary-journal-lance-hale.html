  <title>The Obituary Journal - Lance Hale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coda King is shrouded in death. It started with his mother committing suicide when he was a boy and continued when his wife was abducted on their wedding night. Now the rest of his days are spent trying to apprehend those that take life. He is a conflicted FBI agent with urgesurges he calls invitations to do bad things, invitations he has yet to accept. Now the body of an old friend has turned up. A friend Coda granted a favor. The only clue is a journal filled with obituaries. One alludes to his missing wife. Many others tie to cases Coda thought were closed. The journal could provide answers to catching a killer, but it could also compromise . . . everything. Coda can only hope his nightmares dont manifest into a reality where his moral compass is a slight nudge away from finally accepting an invitation to do bad things." />
