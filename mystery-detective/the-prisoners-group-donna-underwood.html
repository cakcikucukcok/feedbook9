  <title>The Prisoners’ Group - Donna Underwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Primm is found guilty of manslaughter and sent to serve her sentence at Lancers Womens Prison. Prior to her conviction, Sharon was a well-respected psychologist at the Grief Clinic for five years. Now behind bars, she wants to do something good during her incarceration, so she gets in touch with her old coworkers to see about starting a program for her fellow women in lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her amazement, all four of the social workers at the Grief Clinic agree to get involved. Soon, her pilot program is off and running with Brooksie, Lucinda, Rachael, and Anita at the helm. But its not long before things start going badly at Lancers. An inmate ends up missing, the only trace of her being a bit of blood in the laundry room. Missing quickly turns to murder, and the women are frightened of much more than their fellow convicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres something nasty happening at Lancers, and Sharon is intent on finding out what. With the help of her friends at the Grief Clinic and the other inmates, evil intent and corrupt practices are revealed. Yet whos going to believe a bunch of criminals? Despite the odds, these women will work together to right the wrongs, and some will even find hope in the darkness, emerging victorious on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;" />
