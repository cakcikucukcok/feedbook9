  <title>Lions Behind the Shields - Francis Green Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Louisianan Frank Grima is only ten when he has his first encounter with a white policeman. Shocked at the anger the officer displays simply because Frank is of another color, he runs home to his mama, who makes him faithfully promise that he will always obey the law. Eleven years later, Frank joins the Acadian City police forceyoung, nave, and hungry for knowledge. It is August 28, 1970, and Frank knows he has no choice but to strive for excellence. His life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam veteran Peter Hillman is hired the same day as Frank. Although he has good intentions of rendering justice and making a difference in his community, Peter carries psychological baggage that has the potential to greatly impact his career. As the two recruits begin protecting and serving, they soon learn that racism, anger, and cynicism are prevalent among the ranks. Even though Frank shuns the drama, controversy, and endless dilemmas that surround the force, being a black cop in the Deep South is more challenging than he ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling tale based on true events, police officers labor to render goodand sometimes appalling wrongsonto the citizens of Acadian, and eventually discover that there will always be lost lions behind the badges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
