  <title>X - Warren Kinsella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens with a grisly murder as a loose band of punks face some very real danger from neo-Nazi radicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A New Adult title for teenagers and adults alike, with young characters and very mature themes and experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Author has been involved with the punk scene since the start, has been in bands, run his own record company, and has written hundreds of stories — and one critically acclaimed book, &lt;i&gt;Fury’s Hour&lt;/i&gt; — about punk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Author is a skilled self-marketer: he runs a top Toronto PR firm which has advised countless campaigns about how to get heard by target audiences, particularly youthful ones, and his website, &lt;i&gt;The War Room&lt;/i&gt;, attracts 3.5 million visitors a year and he has 22.2K followers on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set in the seventies, but relevant today, focusing on the clash between diversity and tolerance, and those who promote division and hate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;" />
