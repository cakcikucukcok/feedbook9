  <title>Sleep No More - Iris Johansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Iris Johansen comes &lt;i&gt;Sleep No More&lt;/i&gt;, a new thriller that will have Eve Duncan questioning everything she thought she knew about her family and her past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;One woman held captive for decades...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another one freed by the truth...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan knows what it&#39;s like to be haunted by the past.  For years after her daughter Bonnie was stolen from her, she fought for closure.  But now as she&#39;s striving to begin anew, she can&#39;t shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen--or maybe already has.  When her mother, Sandra, asks for help in finding a missing friend named Beth Avery, Eve is sure that she&#39;s hiding something.  It&#39;s odd that Sandra would get involved at all, and the fact that she adamantly refuses to go to the police for help reinforces Eve&#39;s suspicions that something is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve learns that Beth has been locked away in a mental hospital for years, which makes it even harder to understand how she could have disappeared. As Sandra reluctantly reveals small pieces of the truth about Beth&#39;s identity, Eve is shocked to discover that their lives are strangely entwined, and Beth&#39;s disappearance now puts them all in grave danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Desperate, Eve enlists a secret weapon to pick up Beth&#39;s trail:  rogue profiler, Kendra Michaels. With an uncanny ability to detect clues and solve puzzles, Kendra begins to uncover the bizarre circumstances of Beth&#39;s escape from what should have been the safety of her hospital room. Beth is on the run, and as her mind clears--detoxing from the drugs that have held her prisoner--she begins to see the threads of a twisted plot within the powerful Avery family, threatening to destroy Beth and anyone else who might jeopardize the high-stakes game that is already in play.&lt;/p&gt;" />
