  <title>Always Thaddeus - Marcee Corn, James Mackenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hope is a cornerstone of human existence. Hope may even define what it means to be human. It is such a visceral emotion that it can be even more enduring than love. For when love fails, the hope for love can endure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three individuals, eagerly pursuing their own version of hope, arrive on the idyllic island of Owls Nest. Believing they will find hope through the others, they soon learn that they must find it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting alone on the funeral parlors porch, Beth Morgan slowly rocks herself back and forth and back again. Alone in her misery she sits and rocks while frantically searching her mind for hope. Though there is a tombstone with her sons name on it, she believes that Thaddeus is still alive. All she must do is find him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stiff sea breeze coming off the water caresses Sandy Smithsons face and pulls at her hair. She is invigorated by the smell of sea salt and fish as they compete for her senses. Suddenly feeling hopeful, she wonders if Owls Nest is where she will find love again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running from his past, Andrew Morgan searches for sanctuary from the scars of life. He finds it on Owls Nest. But waiting in the shadows and hidden in plain sightevil lurks. It moves through the streets, into the cottages, and onto the unruly shores of this peaceful island bringing devastation and destruction. Owls Nest, Maine, the respite from his past, turns on Andrew in a moment, leaving him exposed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
