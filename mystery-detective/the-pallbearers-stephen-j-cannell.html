  <title>The Pallbearers - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;From the perennial &lt;/I&gt;New York Times &lt;I&gt;bestseller comes a powerful new novel in which Detective Shane Scully, who grew up as an orphan, must revisit his painful childhood to find out who murdered the kind and charismatic man who became a father to him &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandoned by his parents as an infant, Scully was reared in an orphanage, Huntington House. The only positive thing in his young life was the attention of the Home&#39;s director, Walter &quot;Pop&quot; Dix. Pop, an avid surfer, would take a small group of kids for early morning surfing. He was the father none of them had ever had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was thirty years ago. Now, Shane is forced to revisit these memories when Pop is found dead, the victim of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun blast. He leaves a message asking six specific people, all of whom attended Huntington House, to be his pallbearers, and Shane is one of the chosen. He and his fellow pallbearers don&#39;t believe it was a suicide. That leaves murder. But why, and by whom? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the pallbearers embark on a dangerous odyssey in pursuit of justice for Pop, and for retribution against those responsible for his death. Their journey takes them up against an unforeseen adversary whose power and influence far exceed anything they could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
