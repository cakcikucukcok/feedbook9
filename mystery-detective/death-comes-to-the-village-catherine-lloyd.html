  <title>Death Comes to the Village - Catherine Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A wounded soldier and a rector&#39;s daughter discover strange goings-on in the sleepy village of Kurland St. Mary in Catherine Lloyd&#39;s charming Regency-set mystery debut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Major Robert Kurland has returned to the quiet vistas of his village home to recuperate from the horrors of Waterloo. However injured his body may be, his mind is as active as ever. Too active, perhaps. When he glimpses a shadowy figure from his bedroom window struggling with a heavy load, the tranquil fa&amp;#231;ade of the village begins to loom sinister.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to forget the incident, Robert confides in his childhood friend, Miss Lucy Harrington. As the dutiful daughter of the widowed rector, following up on the major&#39;s suspicions offers a welcome diversion--but soon presents real danger. Someone is intent on stopping their investigation. And in a place where no one locks their doors, a series of thefts and the disappearance of two young serving girls demands explanation.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Robert grapples with his difficult recovery, he and Lucy try to unearth the dark truth lurking within the village shadows, and stop a killer waiting to strike again.  .  ." />
