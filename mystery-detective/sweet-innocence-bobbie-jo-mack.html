  <title>Sweet Innocence - Bobbie Jo Mack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, which is based on many true events, is suspenseful, morbid, heartbreaking, and occasionally comical. From the first chapter where she loses her virginity in a devastating way that she brought on herself completely, to wanting nothing more than to run from her fears after being mentally violated by a sex-craved man whore. When she finally gets away from it all and moves to college, she goes into a deep depression realizing that she was sexually assaulted, perhaps even raped in a way the first time she had sex. Paranoia creeping up slowly, but dangerously into her sane state of mind has her on edge. And then, one lonely night walking past the campus parking garage, an event occurs that entwines her life with a family that has been shredded by the same man that will destroy her existence. Part two starts several years after part one, and the main character becomes her own detective when everyone who keeps working on her case is disappearing or committing suicide. The endangerments she gets forced into become real when she has to defeat her own inner turmoil to save a stranger who means more to her than her own life." />
