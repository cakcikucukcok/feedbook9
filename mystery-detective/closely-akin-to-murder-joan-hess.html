  <title>Closely Akin to Murder - Joan Hess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At first it seems like a prank. How could Veronica Landonwood be the voice on the other end of the phone when she died three decades ago? But as Arkansas bookseller and amateur sleuth Claire Malloy is about to find out, her cousin &quot;Ronnie&quot; is very much alive--and in trouble. And could use Claire&#39;s help... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Ronnie is a renowned scientist living in Chicago. But when she was a teenager, she had a run-in with a famous Hollywood producer in Acapulco, Mexico. He attempted to sexually assault her--and she killed him. Having served time in prison, Ronnie finally put her this episode behind her...until now. Just when she has a real shot at the Nobel Prize, a ruthless blackmailer is threatening to expose the secrets of her past. Can Claire help to preserve Ronnie&#39;s reputation and keep her out of harm&#39;s way? That will depend on Claire&#39;s investigation--and what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; happened on the night of the murder so many years ago...&lt;/p&gt;" />
