  <title>Mississippi Blood - Greg Iles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GoodReads Choice Award semi finalist, Amazon Best Mysteries &amp;#38; Thrillers of 2017 selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The final installment in the epic &lt;em&gt;Natchez Burning &lt;/em&gt;trilogy by Greg Iles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Natchez Burning&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is extraordinarily entertaining and fiendishly suspenseful. I defy you to start it and find a way to put it down; as long as it is, I wished it were longer. . . . This is an amazing work of popular fiction.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the longest, most successful sustained works of popular fiction in recent memory&amp;#8230; Prepare to be surprised. Iles has always been an exceptional storyteller, and he has invested these volumes with an energy and sense of personal urgency that rarely, if ever, falter.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endgame is at hand for Penn Cage, his family, and the enemies bent on destroying them in this revelatory volume in the epic trilogy set in modern-day Natchez, Mississippi&amp;#8212;Greg Iles&amp;#8217;s epic tale of love and honor, hatred and revenge that explores how the sins of the past continue to haunt the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn&#39;s experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations--preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others.&amp;#160; Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner.&amp;#160; It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son--Penn&#39;s half-brother--who sets in motion the murder case against his father.&amp;#160; The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi&#39;s violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to trust anyone around him--not even his own mother--Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father&#39;s case. Together, Penn and Serenity battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble: their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mississippi Blood&lt;/em&gt; is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making--one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
