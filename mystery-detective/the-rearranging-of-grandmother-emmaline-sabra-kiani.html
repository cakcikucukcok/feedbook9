  <title>The Rearranging of Grandmother Emmaline - Sabra Kiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why was the home of a young couple with a seven-year-old boy invaded by the police, the house searched without a warrant, and the mother taken away in handcuffs with no explanation? 
How did Emmaline Raleigh, head of Raleigh Corp. and self-styled arbiter of class, end up forced to serve in a homeless shelter as partial repayment for the defamation of character and false arrest of her own unacknowledged daughter-in-law?
Why was an ancient temple piece, the opposite of one being studied in the museum and a precious gift from her deceased husband, stolen from the Raleigh home? 
How did an intelligent and curious little boy happen to notice something, which he reported to a most unusual butler, that would ultimately free his mother?
Who would have expected that the unusual combination of a young mother, her seven-year-old son, her retired and ill high-school teacher father, his butler turned companion, and the director of antiquities of the city museum would be instrumental in setting up an education program for homeless children as well as being the cause of the arrest of an international thief?
Will these unusual occurrences lead to a mutually satisfactory end?" />
