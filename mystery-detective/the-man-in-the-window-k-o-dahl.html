  <title>The Man in the Window - K. O. Dahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A cryptic murder resurrects dark memories of past atrocities in this latest mystery from the master of Norwegian crime writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning author K. O. Dahl received international acclaim for his gripping debut thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Fourth Man&lt;/i&gt;, which introduced readers to Detective Inspector Frank Frølich and Detective Chief Inspector Gunnarstranda. Now the Oslo detectives are back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Friday the thirteenth, the Norwegian capital is enveloped in freezing cold, and Reidar Folke Jespersen passes what will be the last day of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aging antique dealer leaves home and takes a taxi to a nearby café. A few hours later, through the window of the café, he watches his wife enter the door to a flat on the other side of the street, where her lover lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the following morning, Jespersen is found stabbed to death, sitting naked in an armchair in the display window of his antique shop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives Frølich and Gunnarstranda are called to the scene. Their only clues are a numerical combination written in ink on the body of the dead man, a red string tied around his neck, a few missing World War II objects, and a number of people extremely satisfied with the news of the man&#39;s death. Questions of love and betrayal, loyalty and guilt consume the investigation, just as they fill the private lives of the investigators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;K. O. Dahl&#39;s dark and poetic writing moves through the shadows of one country&#39;s history---a country where victims, perpetrators, and even police officers are haunted by the past, still trying to cope with dark memories of the Nazi occupation. &lt;i&gt;The Man in the Window&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, the second installment in Dahl&#39;s Oslo police mysteries,&lt;/i&gt; is an intricate and chilling detective story about love, revenge, and the inescapable past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
