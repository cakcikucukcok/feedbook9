  <title>Two for the Price of One - David Spence, Jim Spence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young woman is found murdered in an expensive apartment near the top of a New York City high rise. Her name was DeeDee Miller, the daughter of a West Virginia coal mine owner. She was a friend to everyone and appeared to have no enemiesso who would want her dead? Young detective Billy Michaels is given her casehis first assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he begins to consider the evidence, Billy receives a visit from a private investigator named Walter Gumm. Walter used to be a detective, and twenty years before DeeDees murder he investigated a similar crime with equally mysterious circumstances. The killer was never found, and Walter has a feeling Billys perpetrator might be the same man from twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Billy is blocked on all sides. His investigation stalls as he is thwarted by politicians, socialites, and even his own police force. Who would want to cover up the murder of DeeDee Miller? It must be someone with something to hide. Billy wont let this case remain unsolved. Failure is not an option  but Billys ambition might cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
