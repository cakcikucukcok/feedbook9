  <title>Dead in the Dregs: A Babe Stern Mystery - Peter Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Prominent wine critic Richard Wilson makes a living elevating and destroying winemakers&amp;#8217; reputations with the stroke of his pen. When he disappears after a tasting at Napa Valley&amp;#8217;s Norton Winery, his sister Janie looks to her ex-husband Babe Stern for help. But when Wilson&amp;#8217;s body is found floating in a vat at Norton, Stern&amp;#8217;s search turns into a hunt for the killer.&lt;BR&gt;Working with the Napa Valley police, Stern quickly finds a string of suspects, all with one thing in common: their desire to get revenge for the reviews that shattered their wines and livelihoods. But as the police work to quickly clear the case, those same suspects have a string of alibis and the trail begins to fade.&lt;BR&gt;Stern digs further into the circumstances of Wilson&amp;#8217;s death and finds himself following his only lead, to Burgundy, France. In cellars and tasting rooms from Beaune to Nuits-Saint-Georges, Stern tracks the troubled son of a family of &lt;I&gt;vignerons&lt;/I&gt;, one of the few people in the winery the night Wilson died. But the wine families of the C&amp;#244;te d&amp;#8217;Or are secretive and entangled, and the further Stern goes to discover the truth, the more he becomes the ultimate target. In a stunning debut mystery packed with revenge and murder, Stern&amp;#8217;s only choice is to find the truth.&lt;/div&gt;" />
