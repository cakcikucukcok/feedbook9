  <title>Trippplets - Paul Daze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preaston, California is headed for a staggering shake up unlike no earthquake can create, by virtue of teen identical triplets Terrell, Derrell, and Jerrell Jenkins. However, their road to excellence is paved with many potholes to make their journey jarring and difficult. With each brother having their share of problems, Terrells troubles seem to eclipse the others by far. Being overly good-natured brands him an easy target for public harassment, ridicule, and disregard, and if that wasnt enough, the strong tie he always had with his brothers is quickly unraveling. Terrell feels obligated to preserve unity within the family, since it was the one thing the boys father routinely instilled in them, right up until the time of his mysterious death. 
As Terrells optimism declines, his discovery of three mystical stones, which grants the brothers with incredible mental powers, is just the remedy to give his diminishing hope an upsurge. The stones were once owned by gifted Asian children, born over two thousand years ago, and identical triplets as well. The vitality of these extraordinary gems establishes a special meaning for both generations of triplets, and sets the course for adventure that will ultimately change the city of Preaston and mankinds lives forever." />
