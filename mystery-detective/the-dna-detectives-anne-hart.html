      <meta name="description" content="A scientist awakes in a theater with her memory erased, rain-soaked clothing, someone elses underwear, a new face, pregnant, and no identification, money, or shoes. Her only connection to reality is the business card she finds crumpled in the corner of her pocket that leads her to the molecular genetics department of a university medical school where the professor, a scientist and law man is rushing to save the life of a man on Death Row whose name was tagged on anothers DNA twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New DNA technology has allowed former detectives to return to their cold cases decades later and use the new DNA technology to solve the old cases with new evidence. Now she must work with him in a race against time to save an innocent man whose DNA was tagged by clerical error or purpose to crime evidence DNA, landing him in prison for decades.&lt;/p&gt;" />
