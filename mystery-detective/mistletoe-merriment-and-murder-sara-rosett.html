  <title>Mistletoe, Merriment, And Murder - Sara Rosett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Super organizer Ellie Avery could really use some Christmas cheer when Gabrielle Matheson, a grinchy professional rival, sets up shop in the same small Georgia town. But before the halls are even halfway decked with holly, someone uses Ellie&#39;s terrifically tasteless white elephant swap gift as.  .  .a murder weapon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie&#39;s now a suspect. Besides playing Mrs. Santa for her Air Force pilot husband and their two kids, shielding her eyes from the garishly over-decorated house down the street, and helping a client who&#39;s a hardcore hoarder, Ellie also has to solve this ho-ho-homicide.  .  .and find a killer who wishes her a very deadly Christmas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss Ellie Avery&#39;s great tips for a relaxed and stress-free holiday season! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sara Rosett&#39;s Ellie Avery series is a winner. Rosett always delivers a terrific mystery with believable characters and lots of heart. The insider look at the life of a military spouse makes this series a fascinating read.
