  <title>The Shattered Tree - Charles Todd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;World War I battlefield nurse Bess Crawford goes to dangerous lengths to investigate a wounded soldier&amp;#8217;s background&amp;#8212;and uncover his true loyalties&amp;#8212;in this thrilling and atmospheric entry in the bestselling &amp;#8220;vivid period mystery series&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the foot of a tree shattered by shelling and gunfire, stretcher-bearers find an exhausted officer, shivering with cold and a loss of blood from several wounds. The soldier is brought to battlefield nurse Bess Crawford&amp;#8217;s aid station, where she stabilizes him and treats his injuries before he is sent to a rear hospital. The odd thing is, the officer isn&amp;#8217;t British&amp;#8212;he&amp;#8217;s French. But in a moment of anger and stress, he shouts at Bess in German.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bess reports the incident to Matron, her superior offers a ready explanation. The soldier is from Alsace-Lorraine, a province in the west where the tenuous border between France and Germany has continually shifted through history, most recently in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, won by the Germans. But is the wounded man Alsatian? And if he is, on which side of the war do his sympathies really lie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Matron could be right, but Bess remains uneasy&amp;#8212;and unconvinced. If he was a French soldier, what was he doing so far from his own lines . . . and so close to where the Germans are putting up a fierce, last-ditch fight?&lt;/p&gt;When the French officer disappears in Paris, it&amp;#8217;s up to Bess&amp;#8212;a soldier&amp;#8217;s daughter as well as a nurse&amp;#8212;to find out why, even at the risk of her own life." />
