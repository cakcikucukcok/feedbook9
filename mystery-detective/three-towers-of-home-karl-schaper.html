      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;German Hans Schaefer was wrongly convicted of crimes against Russia and sentenced to ten years hard labor in a Soviet work camp. After being rehabilitated from near death, Hans makes a break for his freedom, understandably fixated on the thought of returning home to be united with his family and friendsbut the trip will not be simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans endures a long and lonely trek down a frozen river where he meets unexpected danger at almost every turn. He makes it back to civilization but little does Hans know that even more danger lies in wait. Fortunately, he makes a friend who helps him recuperate from his long journey and get started on the next leg of his voyage home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His train trip though the populated backcountry of the Soviet Union presents many unexpected challenges for Hans. Even with Russian travel credentials and help from Russian friends, he finds it difficult to disguise his German heritage and avoid being captured by Russian officials. Yet, he is willing to do anything to get back to the people he loves, even risk his own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
