  <title>Requiem for a Dealer - Jo Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can waste a lot of time looking. . . . Or you can pay me to find it for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brodie Farrell is a busy woman, what with running her one-woman firm &lt;i&gt;Looking for Something? &lt;/i&gt;and raising her daughter. So on her night off, all she wants is to spend a relaxing evening teaching her friend Daniel Hood to drive. But the evening takes a disturbing turn when Daniel hits a young woman who seems to appear out of nowhere. The girl, Alison Barker, is mostly uninjured, but before she runs off she accuses Daniel of trying to kill her.&lt;br&gt;The other man in Brodie&#39;s life, Detective Superintendent Jack Deacon, isn&#39;t much help; he&#39;s too busy investigating a dangerous new drug called Scram. But when Alison Barker turns up at the hospital, not as a result of the car accident but because of the lethal amount of Scram in her system, Jack is forced to get involved. Alison claims that the death of her father, a local purebred horse dealer, was murder---and that unless someone helps her, she&#39;ll be next.&lt;br&gt;Brodie once again finds herself torn between the two men in her life---Daniel believes Alison&#39;s story, Jack doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s up to Brodie to infiltrate Alison&#39;s world of show jumping and discover the truth herself, before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
