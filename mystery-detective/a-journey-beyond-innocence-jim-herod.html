He would offer his assistance as a medical officer under the command of John Hunt Morgan. William arrived in Middle Tennessee in time to participate in the Battle of Hartsville. A Union garrison had set up camp around the Averitt House and in the valley below. Morgans forces crossed the Cumberland River before the &lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Union&lt;/st1:place&gt; troops had finished their morning coffee on December 7. After capturing the Union brigade and supplies, the Confederated soldiers re-crossed the river completing their mission just prior to the arrival of a larger Union army. William Stone chose to stay in the Averitt house. He would provide care for the wounded soldiers from both sides of the conflict. From there, he would face the brunt of anger incurred by this Union defeat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
