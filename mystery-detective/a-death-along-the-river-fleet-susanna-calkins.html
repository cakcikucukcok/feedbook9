  <title>A Death Along the River Fleet - Susanna Calkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lucy Campion, a ladies&#39; maid turned printer&#39;s apprentice in 17th-century London, is crossing Holborn Bridge over the murky waters of the River Fleet one morning when, out of the mist, she sees a specter moving toward her. Frightened at first, Lucy soon realizes the otherworldly figure is in fact a young woman, clearly distraught and clad only in a blood-spattered white nightdress. Barely able to speak, the woman has no memory of who she is or what&#39;s happened to her. The townspeople believe she&#39;s possessed. But Lucy is concerned for the woman&#39;s well-being and takes her to see a physician. When, shockingly, the woman is identified as the daughter of a nobleman, Lucy is asked to temporarily give up her bookselling duties to discreetly serve as the woman&#39;s companion while she remains under the physician&#39;s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the woman slowly recovers, she begins--with Lucy&#39;s help--to reconstruct the terrible events that led her to Holborn Bridge that morning. But when it becomes clear the woman&#39;s safety might still be at risk, Lucy becomes unwillingly privy to a plot with far-reaching social implications, and she&#39;ll have to decide just how far she&#39;s willing to go to protect the young woman in her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susanna Calkins has drawn a richly detailed portrait of a time in history and a young woman struggling against the bounds of her society in her next absorbing Lucy Campion mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
