  <title>Rosemary and Crime - Gail Oust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Murder comes well-seasoned in this charming mystery featuring a smart and spunky new amateur sleuth, small-town Georgia spice shop owner Piper Prescott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piper Prescott, a transplanted Yankee living in the South, has got her sass back. She might be down, but don&#39;t count her out. &quot;Change of life?&quot; she asks. Bring it on. Recently divorced, Piper decides to pursue a dream she&#39;s secretly harbored: owning her own business, Spice it Up!, a spice shop in her adopted hometown, Brandywine Creek, Georgia. But Piper&#39;s grand opening goes awry when the local chef who&#39;s agreed to do a cooking demo is found stabbed. Not only did Piper find the body, she handled the murder weapon and doesn&#39;t have a witness to her alibi, making the case look like a slam dunk to brand new police Chief Wyatt McBride. Desperate to uncover the truth--and prove her innocence--Piper enlists the help of her outspoken BFF Reba Mae Johnson to help track down the real culprit. The pair compile a lengthy list of suspects and work to eliminate them using their own creative brand of sleuthing techniques including stakeouts, breaking and entering, and one very unorthodox chocolate pie. When Piper narrowly avoids being a victim of a hit-and-run, she knows she&#39;s getting closer to the truth, but can she catch the killer and clear her name before she becomes the next victim? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A captivating start to a new series featuring an unstoppably fabulous new crime-solving heroine, a colorful cast of small town characters, and more than a pinch of Georgia charm, &lt;i&gt;Rosemary and Crime&lt;/i&gt; by Gail Oust is sure to delight fans of cozy mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
