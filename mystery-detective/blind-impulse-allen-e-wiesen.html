  <title>Blind Impulse - Allen E. Wiesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diverted from an Ebola conference in Zaire, Dr. Cynthia Marsh, world renowned expert on emerging diseases, suddenly confronts a virus from hell. She soon discovers that variola d is a man-made microbe, engineered not merely to infect and multiply, but to mutate. The CDC has no vaccine with which to prevent it, and medications prove useless against it.&lt;P&gt;
Noel Parke, former police psychologist and New York regional director of the Homeland Protection Agency, discovers that several of the viruss victims show signs of hypnotically induced amnesia. But who hypnotized them? And what exactly has he programmed them to do?&lt;P&gt;
Parke turns to Dr. Gabriel Moore, a psychologist specializing in amnesia. Together, they unravel the identity of the mysterious man responsible for implanting the hypnotic suggestions. It quickly becomes apparent that he has transformed his victims into microbial delivery systems. Within their minds are detailed commands as to how and where to disperse the virus. But who they are, and when they will strike, remains a mystery.&lt;P&gt;
Yet buried in their subconscious is the information that Parke must uncover if he is to avert the deadliest bioterrorist attack the world has ever known. And time is rapidly running out.&lt;P&gt;
Blind Impulse is not science fiction. It is a drama of deadly microbiology mutating beyond human control." />
