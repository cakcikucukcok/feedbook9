  <title>Wink of an Eye - Lynn Chandler Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the run from a double-cross, Las Vegas private investigator Gypsy Moran shows up unexpectedly at his sister Rhonda&#39;s house in Wink, Texas. She introduces Gypsy to one of her former students, 12-year-old Tatum McCallen, who is in need of Gypsy&#39;s services. Tatum wants to hire Gypsy to investigate his father Ryce&#39;s alleged suicide. His dad was a deputy with the Sheriff&#39;s department and was found hanged in their backyard. Tatum believes his father was murdered after he went inquiring after the disappearance of  several teenage girls, all undocumented immigrants. Against his better judgment, Gypsy agrees to snoop around to see what he can find. Between dealing with his now married high school sweetheart, a sexy reporter, and hostile police officers, Gypsy has his work cut out for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynn Chandler Willis&#39; &lt;i&gt;Wink of an Eye&lt;/i&gt; is a strong addition to a long list of The Private Eye Writers of America (PWA) Competition winners that includes Steve Hamilton and Michael Koryta.&lt;/p&gt;" />
