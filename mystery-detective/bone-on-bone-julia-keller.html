  <title>Bone on Bone - Julia Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bone on Bone, &lt;/i&gt;the next powerful chapter in Pulitzer Prize-winner Julia Keller&#39;s beloved Bell Elkins series, sends readers headlong into the thick of a mystery as young as today&#39;s headlines -- but as old as the mountains that hold these lives in a tight grip.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How far would you go for someone you love? Would you die? Would you kill? After a three-year prison sentence, Bell Elkins is back in Acker&#39;s Gap. And she finds herself in the white-hot center of a complicated and deadly case -- even as she comes to terms with one last, devastating secret of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent local family has fallen victim to the same sickness that infects the whole region: drug addiction. With mother against father, child against parent, and tensions that lead inexorably to tragedy, they are trapped in a grim, hopeless struggle with nowhere to turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell has lost her job as prosecutor -- but not her affection for her ragtag, hard-luck hometown. Teamed up with former Deputy Jake Oakes, who battles his own demons as he adjusts to life as a paraplegic, and aided by the new prosecutor, Rhonda Lovejoy, Bell tackles a case as poignant as it is perilous, as heartbreaking as it is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;" />
