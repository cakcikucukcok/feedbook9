  <title>Joshua and the Shadow of Death - Gary McPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I never thought my life would turn out like this. My best friend Richard Brown is dead. Parts of his brain still paint the wall where he shot himself. Eighteen years ago, he and Barbara entrusted me with curing their adopted son, Harold. I was so sure of myself. After all, I had cured his half-brother at the orphanage. I thought I knew what I was doing, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard left me a note telling me to help Harold find the men responsible. Richard claims if we fail to solve his suicide that his company and everyone working there will be lost. What does that mean, and does it matter? How can I help? I am a psychiatrist, not a detective. If I fail, what will become of Barbara? Will Harold&amp;rsquo;s grief unleash the beast living inside him? The berserker is controlled, but he is not contained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join childhood development psychiatrist Doctor Joshua Zeev as he attempts to find the answers to his best friend&amp;rsquo;s death and help the family through their grief. Will his challenge of a lifetime bring answers and closure, or even more perilous dangers?&lt;/p&gt;" />
