      <meta name="description" content="Jamaican-born Cr has been dragged around the world for years by her mother, who wandered in pursuit of love. When they finally return to their island home, Cr hopes to make a life there. She finds friends, develops relationships, and grows close to her home country. But all of that quickly changes one night with the arrival of her stepfather, David. 
With Crs mother supposedly away in Canada, David tries to rape her. With no other option, Cr kills her stepfather. It soon comes to light, however, that David was not who he appeared to be; he is actually a ruthless crime boss, and Crs friend, Stacy, suspects he may have killed Crs mother. Now, Cr is on the run from Davids murderous brother, Tanny.
Tanny does all the dirty work and doesnt mind getting his hands bloody, but Cr has no intention of becoming one of his victims. Instead, she trains to kill. She will be ready when Tanny comes for herif she doesnt decide to go after him first. Shell do anything to find out what happened to her mother and get her old life backanything." />
