  <title>The Do or Die Machine - Barry Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Moore hops a plane from San Antonio to San Francisco following an urgent call from his former private-investigator and police-force partner, Sam Roth. Sam has information from David&#39;s estranged wife, Jennifer, which David hopes is a plea to save their marriage. When he hooks up with Sam, David finds something more disturbing.&lt;/P&gt;
Sam&#39;s troubles go deeper than Jennifer&#39;s disappearance and are too much for him to handle alone. He&#39;s over his head investigating the San Francisco mob. When they find Sam&#39;s car abandoned with Jennifer&#39;s purse and keys inside, David awakens his long-dormant instincts for exposing corruption and violence.&lt;/P&gt;
Waiting for David is a bloodthirsty army waging a drug-supply war; an imaginative, yet amoral scientist who gives people joy as long as they become willing slaves; and an ex-cop on whom David blew the whistle for planting evidence. David&#39;s feel for the streets sustains him as he crisscrosses San Francisco&#39;s landscape to uncover greed and violence.&lt;/P&gt;
Worst of all, David rattles the cages of power. But fighting the machinery of falsehood means discovering a secret his wife had kept from him. Will David&#39;s enemies force him to live a life he has forsworn?&lt;/P&gt;" />
