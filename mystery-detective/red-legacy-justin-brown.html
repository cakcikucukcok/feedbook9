  <title>Red Legacy - Justin Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eden was once a peaceful town, filled with boisterous and bustling residents. Where the fauna stayed a constant green and birds sung melodies of songs. Twenty-three years later Eden had started to burn. The disease had gained a foothold on its population with deceitful intentions, with no cure in sight. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evil had returned to claim its birthright, with the savior nowhere in sight. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jaxon had a calling originating from deep within his soul while Sophie was lost on a path of self-discovery. Sam struggled with the past he was all too familiar with and Brian must face his fears, if he is to survive.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jaxon must use every gift and helping hand if he is to save Eden from the legacy thrust upon it, from a time long before his. Does he have the strength and love from his companions to help him fulfill his destiny, or will he be persuaded by the evil that was passed down to him from the beginning. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One thing is known for sure. A battle of good and evil is about to take place ensuring that a time of ultimate confrontation is at hand." />
