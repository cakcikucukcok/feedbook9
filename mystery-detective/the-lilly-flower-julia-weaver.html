  <title>The Lilly Flower - Julia Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When she was a small child, Lilly and her mother had lived with her Uncle John, an archaeologist, in an old caravanserai near Konya in Turkey. Her father, his brother, was excavating at another archaeological site in Syria.&lt;br&gt;
	Lilly loved her Uncle John. He had recently had a heart attack, so when his partner Aladdin telephoned to inform her, she planned to visit him immediately. &lt;br&gt;
	When she exited the Ankara Airport, her Uncles partner Aladdin was not there to meet her as he usually was. Lilly waited an hour and then hired a taxi to go to her uncles apartment. &lt;br&gt;
	She was met by two policemen enquiring about her uncles friend Nick Talmage. She let the police enter the apartment and search its rooms. When they finally left, she bolted the door. &lt;br&gt;
	Lilly was ready for bed when she heard noises in the hallway and looking around the bedrooms doorway, she saw Nick Talmage collapse to the floor. A bookcase behind him swung back into its place in the wall.
