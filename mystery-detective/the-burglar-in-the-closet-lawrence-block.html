  <title>The Burglar in the Closet - Lawrence Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to ignore someone with his hands in your mouth. Bernie Rhodenbarr&#39;s all ears when Dr. Sheldrake, his dentist, starts complaining about his detestable, soon-to-be-ex wife, and happens to mention the valuable diamonds she keeps lying around the apartment. Since Bernie&#39;s been known to supplement his income as a bookstore owner with the not-so-occasional bout of high-rise burglary, a couple of nights later he&#39;s in the Sheldrake apartment with larceny on his mind -- and has to duck into a closet when the lady of the house makes an unexpected entrance. Unfortunately he&#39;s still there when an unseen assailant does Mrs. Sheldrake in . . . and then vanishes with the jewels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernie&#39;s got to come out of the closet some time. But when he does, he&#39;ll be facing a rap for a murder he didn&#39;t commit -- and for a burglary he certainly attempted -- unless he can hunt down the killer who left him  hanging.&lt;/p&gt;" />
