  <title>Strictly No(Ir)Where - Jim Van Loozen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cameron Price is a disbarred attorney turned private investigator. Super attorney Harris Monahan calls upon his expertise when a woman goes missing. Maggie is Danny Freemans pregnant wife, and no one can be sure if shes been murdered or if shes run away. Thats because Danny and his wife havent always had the most stable of relationships.
Maggie herself has been suspected of some unscrupulous behavior. In the past, she ran away from former fianc Tommy Lewis to have an abortion. Lewis has gone so far as to claim visitation rights on Danny and Maggies child, so Price wouldnt be surprised if the man was somehow involved in the womans sudden disappearance. 
James Patrick is Maggies brotheran overzealous cop who does nothing but slow down Prices search for the truth. Patrick blames Danny, who he assumes is having an affair. He even goes so far as to intimidate Price to make his story stick. Price, however, is not a man easily intimidated. He will find the truth at whatever cost." />
