  <title>Dead Soul - James D. Doss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When tribal chairman Oscar Sweetwater asks Charlie Moon to look into the murder of a fellow Ute, Billy Smoke, Charlie agrees, but he doesn&#39;t expect to find anything. After all, Billy&#39;s boss, U.S. Senator Patch Davidson, nearly died in the ambush that night, too, so the FBI handled the investigation and it&#39;s still unsolved. The senator does happen to be Charlie&#39;s neighbor, though-their ranches share a fence line-so maybe the senator will be more forthcoming with him than he was with the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Charlie&#39;s aunt Daisy, an elderly tribal shaman whose visions are looked upon by Charlie with skepticism even when they ring true, has seen a woman desperate for Charlie&#39;s help. Daisy begins to badger Charlie to look for her, even though she can&#39;t tell him her name, where to look, or why she&#39;s in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&#39;s shaping up to be another season in which the gentleman rancher spends more time being a reluctant investigator than working on his ranch, helping with the cattle or in the hunt for Two-toes, the bobcat who&#39;s been sneaking up on his men at work. And truth be told, he&#39;d rather go after the cat, who doesn&#39;t seem as dangerous as Senator Davidson&#39;s enemies or Billy Smoke&#39;s &quot;business&quot; connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Doss&#39;s novels are consistently acclaimed for their combination of tight, suspenseful plotting and lyrical, authentic rendering of Native American themes and images, and &lt;i&gt;Dead Soul&lt;/i&gt; is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;" />
