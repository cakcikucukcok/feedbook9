  <title>Dead Reckoning - Richard Cibrano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1977, and the newly formed House Select Committee on Assassinations is making headlines.  Tom Welles, a successful Pulitzer Prize winning syndicated columnist receives an anonymous letter from an individual alleging firsthand knowledge of the assassination of President Kennedy, with a time and place to meet.  &lt;br /&gt;Welles is skeptical of the offer, and is prepared to dismiss it as exploitation, but there is a hook; the letter challenges him to follow the trail of a heretofore-unknown Intelligence organization.  &lt;br /&gt;Out of his league, Welles reaches out to a colleague with the appropriate contacts in Washington.  However, in tapping his sources, he unwittingly draws the attention of a renegade Intelligence group operating within the highest level of government.  Abruptly drawn into the epicenter of a complex web extending beyond the Kennedy assassination, Welles soon learns of a daring CIA penetration operation into the Soviet Union, meets the agent charged with ousting the rogue element from the Agency hierarchy, and encounters the men desperate to keep hidden the Cold Wars darkest secret.  Ultimately, Welles finds himself in a race against an unseen enemy to locate the one man with the first-hand knowledge capable of toppling this powerful cabal.&lt;br /&gt;Based on more than twenty years of research, and supported by thousands of declassified files, Dead Reckoning is an inventive thriller that dares the reader to consider the antagonisms of United States/Soviet Cold War diplomacy as a mutually beneficial play act between the architects of the military industrial complex on both sides of the Iron Curtain. &lt;/p&gt;" />
