  <title>Diary of the Beloved - Alesa Acorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At 13 years old, Catherine Hepburn is described by her friends as the prettiest girl in the county.  However, the description favoured by her family is that of a good girl with big ears.  In fact, her mother and housekeeper often take the time to help Catherine style her hair in a manner to help hide her big ears.  Gifted by her Uncle Nicholas with a diary one Christmas, Catherine begins to record in it the events and circumstances involving the lives of her family and friends.  Unknowingly, she records the events of the Hidden, children of noble birth who are hidden in common households until they are of an age to inherit their nobility.
At 25 years old, trying to realize her dream as the CEO and Founder of the National Paralegal Foundation is a daunting task for Simone Devereaux.  Her days are spent caring for her mother who suffers from a hereditary mental disorder.  Her nights are spent in the arms of her fianc, District Attorney Jacque Parker and her lover, trust attorney Wolf Carlyle.  
On the death of her grandfather, Simone inherits his private library which contains an extensive collection of books known as the Diary of the Beloved written by Catherine Hepburn, her mother&#39;s college roommate.  As she reads the diaries to her mother, soon it becomes clear to Simone that Catherine&#39;s diaries hold the secrets of the Hidden, children of noble birth who are hidden amongst commoners until they are of an age to inherit their nobility.  With the help of her fianc and her lover, Simone must learn the identities of the hidden in order to save the life of her mother." />
