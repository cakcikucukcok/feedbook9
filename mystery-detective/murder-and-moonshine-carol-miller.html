  <title>Murder and Moonshine - Carol Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All small towns have secrets---and plenty of them---as every small-town waitress knows. Daisy is no different. A young, recently separated waitress at H &amp; P&#39;s Diner in sleepy southwestern Virginia, she hears more than her fair share of neighborhood gossip while serving plates of hash and peach cobbler. But when a reclusive old man shows up at the diner one day, only to drop dead a few minutes later, Daisy quickly learns that some secrets are more dangerous to keep than others---especially when there are money and moonshine involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man&#39;s death was suspicious, and no longer sure who she can trust, Daisy turns sleuth while also seeking to protect her sick mother and keeping a handle on Aunt Emily, her goading, trigger-happy landlord. Caught between whiskey and guns, a handsome ATF agent and a moonshine-brewing sweet talker, and a painful past and a dangerous present, Daisy has her work cut out for her. There&#39;s trouble brewing in her small town, and before it passes, many secrets will come to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Miller makes a memorable debut in &lt;i&gt;Murder and Moonshine,&lt;/i&gt; the first of an intriguing new mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
