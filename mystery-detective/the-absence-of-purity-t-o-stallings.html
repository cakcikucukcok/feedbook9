  <title>The Absence of Purity - T. O. Stallings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He parked in the same place as the night before. Out of his vehicle he locked it and took several minutes to look around. Satisfied he was alone he shuffled off to his hiding place. Once there he stood quietly watching the house. One light was visible on the second floor. He waited for over an hour after the light went out.
At the door he waited again, his ears straining to detct any sound. From his backpack he produced the necessary tools and within seconds he was standing inside the the house.
What happened after would sent Detective Aaron Tidwell of the Jackson County Sheriff&#39;s office on the longest manhunt of his career. It would also send him into a seedy world unknown by average citizens." />
