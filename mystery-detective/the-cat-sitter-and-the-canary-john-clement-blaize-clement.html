  <title>The Cat Sitter and the Canary - John Clement, Blaize Clement</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Set in the lush and beautiful island of Siesta Key, with a cast of  characters that Dixie fans the world over have come to know and love, &lt;i&gt;The Cat Sitter and the Canary&lt;/i&gt; is the next book by Blaize and her son John Clement. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dixie Hemingway, everyone&#39;s favorite pet-sitting sleuth, is back for yet another riveting case. A delightful addition to this critically acclaimed series, &lt;i&gt;The Cat Sitter and the Canary&lt;/i&gt; is sure to leave both mystery fans and cat lovers alike purring with delight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, Dixie finds a tall, handsome tourist loitering around the home of one of her long-time clients. He tells her he&#39;s just arrived from Scotland and that he&#39;s lost his glasses, which presumably explains why he can&#39;t find the house he rented for his seaside vacation. Dixie points him to the bungalow across the street (but not before rebuffing a few of the sexy Scotsman&#39;s passes) and then continues about her business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She doesn&#39;t think about him again until she stumbles upon a dead body in her client&#39;s front hall -- a man in a three-piece suit with jet-black hair, delicate wrists, and a small notecard stuck to his lapel with a pearl-tipped hat pin. Right away, Dixie puts on her sleuthing cap and starts looking for clues, but when she sees what&#39;s written on that card, she knows... this is going to be an adventure unlike any she&#39;s ever had before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if she&#39;s not careful, it just might be her last!&lt;/p&gt;" />
