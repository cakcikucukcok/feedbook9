  <title>The Binding - E. Z. Rinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fans of Marisha Pessl and Christopher Moore will be captivated by the twists and turns of E.Z. Rinsky&#39;s second chilling noir mystery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a U.S. Senator offers to have private investigator Frank Lamb&amp;#8217;s criminal record wiped clean in return for retrieving a set of old books, he jumps at the opportunity. In the five years since his last paying job he&amp;#8217;s been an international fugitive, separated from his daughter Sadie. He&amp;#8217;s willing to do anything to return to normal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once Frank and his old partner, Courtney Lavagnino, get to work, it becomes clear that the job is far more treacherous than they&amp;#8217;d assumed. The books were written in prison by Oliver Vicks, a self-proclaimed prophet with a trail of grisly murders behind him. Frank and Courtney are soon piecing together a horrifying puzzle, devised by a prisoner who seems more god than man.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this riveting follow-up to the award-nominated &lt;em&gt;Palindrome&lt;/em&gt;, Frank and Courtney find themselves mired in a tangle of desperation, cult-like fervor, and deception that will lead them to uncover an evil of biblical proportions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
