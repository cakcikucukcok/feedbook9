  <title>An Old-Fashioned Murder - Carol Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Secrets, lies, and a splash of moonshine: a classic country house whodunit with a distinctly Southern twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After  losing her husband and her home, small-town girl Daisy McGovern moves  in with her invalid mother at an old inn in sleepy southwestern  Virginia. When the inn&#39;s eccentric proprietor, Aunt Emily, decides to  throw a weekend party for a small group of friends and neighbors,  everybody is excited--until a winter storm approaches and one of the  guests is crushed by an antique bookcase during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At  first, the death appears to be an accident. But as the storm worsens and  the sheriff is unable to reach them, suspicion slowly grows. Was it  murder? After the inn loses power and a second death occurs, it&#39;s clear  to Daisy that one among them is a killer. But who? The young, new,  secretive maid? The antique-peddling pair of spinster sisters? Her  not-so-welcome in-laws? The peculiar house-hunting couple? The  supposedly stranded motorist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no way to leave and no way to  get help, Daisy&#39;s only contacts to the outside world are her best friend  Beulah and the always charming (and equally troublesome) moonshiner,  Rick Balsam. Trapped with a clever and seemingly undetectable murderer,  she must unravel the truth before the party ends with her funeral.&lt;/p&gt;" />
