      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of the Looking for Trouble travel book series, Poke Rafferty is ready to settle down in Bangkok with his fianc&amp;#233;e, Rose, and his newly adopted daughter, Miaow. But trouble isn&#39;t ready to let him go; it&#39;s back in Poke&#39;s life with a vengeance, in the guise of his long-estranged father, Frank, the last person he ever wanted to see again. And Frank hasn&#39;t come empty-handed, arriving with a box of rubies, a wad of fraudulent identity papers, and one of the most dangerous gangsters in China in hot pursuit. With a rogue American Secret Service agent targeting Rose for her unwitting part in a North Korean counterfeiting operation, Poke can see trouble descending from everywhere to attack those he loves&amp;#8212;and it will take every skill he possesses to keep them, and himself, alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
