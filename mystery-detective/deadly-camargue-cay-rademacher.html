  <title>Deadly Camargue - Cay Rademacher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;International Dagger Award shortlisted author Cay Rademacher delivers a captivating follow-up to his atmospheric &lt;i&gt;Murderous Mistral&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Deadly Camargue&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August: the air over Provence shimmers in suffocating heat. &lt;i&gt;Capitaine&lt;/i&gt; Roger Blanc and his colleague Marius Tonon are called to the Camargue. A black fighting bull has escaped from the pasture and has gored a cyclist. A bizarre accident, or so it initially seems. Until Blanc discovers evidence that someone left the gate open intentionally...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deceased is Albert Cohen, political magazine reporter, fashion intellectual from Paris, TV personality. He was in the Camargue to write a major article on Vincent van Gogh. Yet what has that got to do with the attack? Blanc comes across Cohen&#39;s incomplete report during his investigation, which is not quite as harmless as it initially appeared. And also a spectacular, never solved burglary on the &lt;i&gt;Côte d&#39;Azur&lt;/i&gt;, and an old, deadly story that absolutely everyone wants to forget. By the end, Blanc feels a little more at home in his new surroundings in Provence. But he pays a high price for it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
