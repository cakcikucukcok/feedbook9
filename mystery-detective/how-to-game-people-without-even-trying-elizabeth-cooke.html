  <title>How to Game People Without Even Trying - Elizabeth Cooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, international financier Saul Mammon is king. Hes enigmatic, charismatic, and, one could argue, evil. Nobody plays the game like Saul. His obsessive motivations are practically erotic in nature. He got what he wanted when he wanted it without even trying, but a sensational life lived so precariously on edge can never last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was once a young boy in New York, born to a modest family, with dreams of climbing the gilded ladder to riches and fame. He achieves all this and more with direct connection to leaders not only in the United States but also in the Soviet Union, Paris, and beyond. His only daughter, Sara, watches from the sidelines as her father inches ever closer to the world of power and deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sauls brilliance and dark side eventually lead to his mysterious death and a rapid cover-up. Perhaps it was inevitable that such an ambitious man would fall, but Sara is haunted by questions, most of which will never be answered. Based on a true story, the rise and fall of Saul Mammon shows what happens when ambition turns malicious and when money is never enough.&lt;/p&gt;" />
