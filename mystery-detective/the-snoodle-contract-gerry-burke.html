  <title>The Snoodle Contract - Gerry Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="President Gus Snoodle has obviously rubbed someone the wrong way. Despite the fact that there have been no escalating wars, no sizzling scandals, and no bad reviews of his performance on Dancing with the Stars, his poll numbers are plunging, there is a contract out on him, and his conspirators will stop at nothing to bring him down.
No one is prepared for the intervention of visiting Aussie dynamo Paddy Pest: probably the greatest sleuth to have been denied recognition in his own country or any other. With help from the CIA, the Secret Service, and several beautiful women, Paddy attempts to find a motive for the conspiracy. From a high rollers room in Las Vegas to a Texas airfield, Paddy and his delightful wing person, Saffron Splendido, must ingratiate themselves with the president to avoid a catastrophe. A budding romance only complicates matters as White House deputy chief of staff, Jack Rice, takes a shine to Saffron, leaving everyone to contemplate whether she will become Mrs. Saffron Rice. With more questions than answers, the presidential caravan rolls from Massachusetts to Memphis in search of votes, while a killer quietly waits to strike.
In this humorous political tale, an American president, who is the victim of a diabolical conspiracy, must rely on the talents of a fearless Aussie detective to save his lifeand hopefully his presidency." />
