  <title>The Waiting Room Book - Stephen Hatrak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While an assistant district attorney for Philadelphia County prepares for the biggest trial of his young career, he receives a shocking diagnosis from his doctor. Never one to give up easily, the attorney now must battle the effects of a brain tumor, while also seeking justice for a woman presumed to have been murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his collection of short stories filled with intrigue, mystery, mysticism, and surprise endings, author Stephen Hatrak shines a spotlight on a colorful cast of characters facing unique challenges. After Ryan and Nadine arrive on the beach for a day of respite, Nadine decides to walk along the shoreline, unaware of what she is about to encounter. When Sarah Jochians Pennsylvania farm becomes the focus of a search for two missing children, an old man waits to exact his terror on Sarah and her coven of witches. Three best friends, all coping with equally as distressing dilemmas in their lives, purchase lottery tickets without any idea that the odds of winning may not be as far off as they think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Waiting Room Book is a collection of entertaining short stories that leaves the ending to the imagination while reminding all of us that life can change in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
