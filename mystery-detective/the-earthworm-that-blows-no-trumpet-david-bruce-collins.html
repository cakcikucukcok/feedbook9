  <title>The Earthworm That Blows No Trumpet - David Bruce Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Santa Cecilia is a medium-sized university town in the Texas Hill Country. The townies and gownies get along well enough, and most folks accept their neighbors of all colors, creeds, and orientations. The Unitarian Universalist church downtown is just another house of worship, albeit a bit more liberal than average for a Texas town. The UUs enjoy their jobs (mostly), help their less fortunate neighbors, and raise healthy, intelligent children. Its all just too good to last.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After a popular, outspoken intern minister arrives, important objects start disappearing, then reappearing. Accounts get hacked, windows get broken, and a well-known church member is found strangled. And then it gets really weird.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A large ensemble cast of members and friends put heads and hearts together to figure out who is sabotaging their beloved churchand why. Many of them dont consider themselves religious, but they will defend this church to the death if necessary. In their struggle, they find unlikely allies, bizarre misdirections, great vegan Tex-Mex, killer margaritas, excellent weed, the joys and perils of polyamory, and Transylvanian hospitality that cant be beat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
