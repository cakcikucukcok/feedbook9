  <title>Through the Fire - Raj Lowenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective Daniel Hartman lives in a three-story condo in the Montrose section of Houston that he rents from his twin brother, Dr. David Hartman. When Daniel wakes up to discover a woman, naked and recovering from a savage attack, his first instincts are those of a detective. The woman is not a stranger, however. His life will change as the woman becomes entwined not only with his life but also with his heart. 
The woman, Michael Braun, is scared, homeless, and unsure of what is happening. Daniel Hartman is an intimately familiar stranger, who, without hesitation, wraps her in his protective arms and steals her heart. Can she be sure that this vicious attack was a random act when she remembers nothing of the episode itself? Has Michaels past, a past she struggled to escape from, found her? Can she keep herself and the man she loves safe without losing more than her soul? 
Will Detective Hartman become a pawn in a killers twisted game of revenge? Will he become his lovers dagger, or will he go through the fire to save what he has found?" />
