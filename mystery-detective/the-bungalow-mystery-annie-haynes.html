  <title>The Bungalow Mystery - Annie Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“He had his tea as usual; when I knocked at the door with the tray (he always had afternoon tea), I found him—like this.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Dr Roger Lavington is dreading his debut performance with the village amateur dramatic society. But real-world drama takes over when Lavington’s neighbour, a reclusive artist, is found murdered in his own sitting room. Also found on the scene are a lady’s glove, a diamond ring, and a mysterious young woman who begs Lavington for his protection. Her safety will depend on her ability to take a role in the forthcoming village play—but is Lavington sheltering a wronged woman or a clever murderess?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bungalow Mystery&lt;/i&gt; (1923) was the first of Annie Haynes’s golden age crime novels, and announced a major talent. This new edition, the first in over eighty years, features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“The ingredients in this story are skilfully mixed.” &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;“Contrived and worked out with considerable craftsmanship—drawn with sympathy and power.”&lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Contains many cunning devices.” &lt;i&gt;Outlook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The mystery is a real mystery.” &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Plenty of mystery and drama.” &lt;i&gt;Queen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This author has a sure hand at a crime story…strongly recommended to every type of novel reader.” &lt;i&gt;Liverpool Courier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
