  <title>Still Dead - J. A. Jance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An e-original novella from&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author J. A. Jance,&amp;#160;featuring a sneak peek&amp;#160;of the&amp;#160;next&amp;#160;J. P. Beaumont novel, &lt;em&gt;Proof of Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the disbanding of the Special Homicide Investigation Team, J. P. Beaumont&amp;#8217;s biggest concern is pondering whether he and his wife Mel should finally get a dog. But one voicemail from his old friend Ralph Ames is about to change that. Through Ralph, Beau has become involved in an organization called The Last Chance, which enlists a number of retired homicide investigators to tackle long-unsolved cold cases. The one that has just landed on Beau&amp;#8217;s plate is a thirty-year-old missing persons case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facts are muddy at best; Janice Marie Harrison&amp;#8217;s car was found abandoned near a bridge, and scratched in the dirt nearby was the word &amp;#8220;sorry.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s possible her death was a suicide, but her body was never found. And as Beau begins to investigate, he discovers that no one connected to Janice&amp;#8212;not her once-all-star football player widower, Anders; not her long-grieving sister, Estelle; not sheriff Gavin Loper, who was deputy sheriff at the time of Janice&amp;#8217;s disappearance; and not Anders&amp;#8217;s second wife Betsy&amp;#8212;is exactly what they seem. The question is, which of them knows the truth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why have they kept it buried?&lt;/p&gt;" />
