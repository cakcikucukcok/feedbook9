  <title>A Catered Wedding - Isis Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernadette and Libby Simmons have been working twelve-hour days at their store, A Taste of Heaven. And in between whipping up sweet treats and catering high school graduation parties, the sisters have to fit one more event into their busy schedule: catering a high-society wedding that takes a very low turn.  .  .&lt;P&gt;Leeza Sharp is getting ready to have the wedding of her dreams. She&#39;s got a $25,000 dress (gorgeous and made to order), a rich Estonian fiancé (head of a multimillion dollar caviar empire) and a four-star menu (planned by none other than Bernadette and Libby Simmons). Never mind that she&#39;s not really in love with her boring, bland groom-to-be.&lt;P&gt;But the dream wedding quickly turns into a nightmare. Just hours before she&#39;s scheduled to walk down the aisle, Leeza takes an arrow to the chest--and drops dead. Now Libby and Bernadette have more on their minds than pouring Cristal and cutting up wedding cake: they&#39;ve got an archery-inclined killer to find.  .  .&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Includes 6 Delectable Recipes for You to Try!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;The sisters&#39; playful rivalry, clever dialogue and an eccentric supporting cast make for plenty of cozy fun.&quot; --&lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Frequent humor, a couple of little-old-lady Marxists, and several delicious recipes complete the cozy picture. Recommended for culinary mystery fans.&quot; --&lt;I&gt;Library Journal&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Isis Crawford&lt;/B&gt; was born in Egypt to parents who were in the diplomatic corps. When she was five, her family returned to the States, where her mother opened a restaurant in upper Westchester County and her father became a university professor. Since then, Isis has combined her parents&#39; love of food and travel by running a catering service as well as penning numerous travel-related articles about places ranging from Omsk to Paraguay. Married, with twin boys, she presently resides in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where she is working on the next Bernie and Libby culinary mystery." />
