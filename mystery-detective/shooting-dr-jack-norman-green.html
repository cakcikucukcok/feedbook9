  <title>Shooting Dr. Jack - Norman Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Violence is no stranger to Brooklyn&#39;s Troutman Street, a place where whores, junkies, businesses, cars, and dreams go to die. But here, in a junkyard on Troutman Street, three men search for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoney wakes up with a hangover every morning. He loves his family, but they&#39;re terrified of him. One more DWI and he&#39;ll do time that he can&#39;t afford. His partner Tommy would run their &quot;business&quot; right into the ground -- or make them a fortune; no way to tell which.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommy Roselli, a.ka. &quot;Fat Tommy,&quot; a.ka. &quot;Tommy Bagadonuts&quot; knows the best restaurants in New York and how much to tip the ma&amp;#238;tre d&#39; in each one. He knows who to call if he really wants you sleeping with the fishes. If you met Tommy, you&#39;d remember him. But he&#39;d remember you, your phone number, your wife&#39;s name, and what his chances with her are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuco has a gift, one that will come in handy for Stoney and Tommy when people start dying on Troutman Street. But as he learns to use it -- struggling to walk the line between family, friends, and the law -- he almost forgets the first rule of Troutman Street: &lt;em&gt;Watch your back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
