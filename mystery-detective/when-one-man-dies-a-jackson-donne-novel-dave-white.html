  <title>When One Man Dies: A Jackson Donne Novel - Dave White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Nominated for the Strand Critics Award&lt;br&gt; Nominated for the Shamus Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;div&gt;The critically acclaimed and multi award-nominated first book in the Jackson Donne series, a riveting, gritty thriller from one of the brightest new crime writers working today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A hit and run. Simple as that. And suddenly harmless old Gerry Figuroa is lying dead on the asphalt. New Jersey cop turned private investigator Jackson Donne sure as hell doesn&amp;#8217;t want to investigate his drinking buddy&amp;#8217;s death, but he&amp;#8217;s made a promise that leaves him no choice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And before long, he&amp;#8217;s drawing uncomfortably close to a murderer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, an apparently routine divorce case takes a dangerous turn, and sinister connections to Gerry&amp;#8217;s death start to emerge. Just when it seems things can&amp;#8217;t get any worse, Donne learns that a bitter old enemy is mixed up in the whole mess. Bill Martin, his ex&amp;#150;Narcotics Department partner, has secrets to expose that could reopen the still-aching wounds of Donne&amp;#8217;s past. Permanently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Donne would like nothing better than to crawl back into a bottle and forget he ever heard Gerry Figuroa&amp;#8217;s name, but it&amp;#8217;s too late for that. Now he&amp;#8217;s in way too deep, tangled up in a plot whose tendrils reach far into his town&amp;#8217;s past&amp;#151;and his own.&lt;/div&gt;" />
