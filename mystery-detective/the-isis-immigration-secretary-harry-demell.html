  <title>The Isis Immigration Secretary - Harry DeMell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISIS terrorists bring a weapon of mass destruction across the Mexican border for use in New York City. They plan to bide their time until September 11, and to do so they are filing applications for political asylum with the New York City immigration law firm of Zalmanski and Sorrelli. Those applications allow them to work, travel, and remain in the United States legally until they are ready to strike. 
Tony Sorrelli, lawyer and ladies man, represents these terrorists and gives them every benefit of the doubt. His clients are always right, and the immigration system is always unfair. Adara, the office manager, is an Iraqi refugee who understands these men better than anyone else. As she waits for Tony to take an interest in her, she realizes what is going on with these ISIS clients. She takes action." />
