  <title>Not Alone on the Voyage - Anne-Marie Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After five years of marriage, Sandy thought she knew everything about her husband, Jack, until he died suddenly. Destroyed by grief, she sifts through his belongings and discovers a journal he kept from the summer before they met. He writes of his stay in the small town of Holman in the Arctic Circle, so Sandy decides to go in search of answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the people of Holman are hesitant to welcome a stranger, Sandy soon makes the acquaintance of Charliea man who knew her young husband. She wonders why Jack never mentioned the quaint little town, and she begins to wonder if her husband was hiding something. Turns out he was, but itll take a lot of patience for Sandy to uncover the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along her journey, she meets people who not only help her learn more about Jack, but also help her find a strength within herself she never realized she possessed. Charlie becomes a much-needed support as Sandy reads more of Jacks journal, but Charlie has a secret that will change Sandys life forever, perhaps even more than the loss of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
