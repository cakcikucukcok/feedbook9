  <title>The Panic Zone (A Jack Gannon Novel, Book 2) - Rick Mofina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A car crashes in Wyoming: A young mother is thrown clear of the devastating crash. Dazed, she sees a figure pull her son from the flames. Or does she? The police believe it&#39;s trauma playing tricks on the mind, until the woman hears a voice on the phone: &quot;Your baby is alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A bomb explodes in Rio de Janeiro: The heinous act kills ten people, including two journalists. Jack Gannon&#39;s assignment is to find out whether his colleagues were innocent victims or targets who got too close to a huge story.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A Caribbean cruise ends in horror: Doctors are desperate to identify the cause of a passenger&#39;s agonizing death. They turn to the world&#39;s top scientists, who fear that someone has resurrected their secret research. Research that is now being used as a deadly weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With millions of lives at stake, experts work frantically against time. And as an anguished mother searches for her child and Jack Gannon pursues the truth, an unstoppable force hurls them all into the panic zone.&lt;/p&gt;
