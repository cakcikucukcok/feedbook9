  <title>Swap - John McFetridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detectives Price and McKeon are called to the scene - a husband and wife found slumped in their car, parked sideways on a busy downtown on-ramp, a bullet in each of their heads. That&#39;s what&#39;s in the papers, and that&#39;s all the public sees. Toronto the Good, with occasional specks of random badness. 
But behind that disposable headline, Toronto&#39;s shadow city sprawls outwards, a grasping and vicious economy of drugs, guns, sex, and gold bullion. And that shadow city feels just like home for Get - a Detroit boy, project-raised, ex-army, Iraq and Afghanistan, only signed up for the business opportunities, plenty of them over there. Now he&#39;s back, and he&#39;s been sent up here by his family to sell guns to Toronto&#39;s fast-rising biker gangs, maybe even see about a partnership. 
The man Get needs to talk to is Nugs, leader of the Saints of Hell. Nugs is overseeing unprecedented progress, taking the club national, uniting bikers coast-to-coast (by force if necessary), pushing back against the Italians, and introducing a veneer of respectability. Beards trimmed to goatees, golf shirts instead of leather jackets, and SUVs replacing the bikes. And now the cops can&#39;t tell the difference between bikers and bankers. 
Detectives Price and McKeon? All they can do is watch and grimace and drink, and sweep up the detritus left in crime&#39;s wake - dead hookers, cops corrupted and discarded, anyone else too slow and weak to keep up, or too stupid not to get out of the way. This is Toronto&#39;s shadow city, and you won&#39;t recognize it.
