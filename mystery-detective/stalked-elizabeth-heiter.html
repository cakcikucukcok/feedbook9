            &lt;strong&gt;If you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;m already dead&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the note seventeen-year-old Haley Cooke leaves behind when she disappears from inside her high school. FBI profiler Evelyn Baine is called in to figure out who had reason to hurt her. On the surface, the popular cheerleader has no enemies, but as Evelyn digs deeper, she discovers that everyone close to Haley has something to hide. Everyone from estranged parents, to an older boyfriend with questionable connections, to a best friend who envies Haley&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Secrets can be deadly&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of those secrets may have gotten Haley killed. If she&#39;s still alive, Evelyn knows that the more the investigation ramps up, the more pressure they could be putting on Haley&#39;s kidnapper to make her disappear for good. It&#39;s also possible the teenager isn&#39;t in danger at all, but has skilfully manipulated everyone and staged her own disappearance. Only one thing is certain: uncovering Haley&#39;s fate could be dangerous even deadly to Evelyn herself.&lt;/p&gt;
