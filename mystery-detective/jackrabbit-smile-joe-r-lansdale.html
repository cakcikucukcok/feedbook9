  <title>Jackrabbit Smile - Joe R. Lansdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Edgar Award-winner and fan favorite Joe R. Lansdale is back with Hap and Leonard&#39;s latest caper: investigating the disappearance of a revivalist cult leader&#39;s daughter.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hap and Leonard are an unlikely pair-Hap, a self-proclaimed white trash rebel, and Leonard, a tough-as-nails black gay Vietnam vet and Republican-but they&#39;re the closest friend either of them has in the world. Hap is celebrating his wedding to his longtime girlfriend, Brett (who is also Hap and Leonard&#39;s boss), when their backyard barbecue is interrupted by a couple of Pentecostal white supremacists. They&#39;re not too happy to see Leonard, and no one is happy to see them, but they have a problem and only Hap and Leonard will take the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Judith Mulhaney&#39;s daughter, Jackrabbit, has been missing for five years. Well, she&#39;s been missing from them for five years, but she&#39;s been missing from everybody, including the local no-goods who ran with her, for a few months. Despite their misgivings about Judith and her son, Hap and Leonard take the case. It isn&#39;t long until they find themselves mixed up in a revivalist cult that believes Jesus will return flanked by an army of lizard-men --  solving a murder to boot.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With Lansdale&#39;s trademark humor, whip-smart dialogue, and plenty of ass-kicking adventures to be had, you won&#39;t want to miss Hap and Leonard&#39;s latest." />
