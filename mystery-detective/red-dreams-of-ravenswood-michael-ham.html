  <title>Red Dreams of Ravenswood - Michael Ham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine an island that was a perfect place to take that long deserved vacation. Clean beaches, a boardwalk that stretches for two miles, charter fishing, horseback riding, entertainment rides for the young and old, almost everything you would want for the perfect vacation. Imagine an island with three unique towns with their own historical flavor and a large lake where you can go skiing, fishing, or camp if you prefer to just sleep under the star-filled skies.
	In Red Dreams, the first in a series, Michael Ham takes you to such a place, but instead of warm late spring days, you will venture into a journey of darkness.
	The story begins with Peggy, who is being held captive by a church that has a completely twisted view on their understanding of God. She escapes with four others, and agents for the church quickly track them down, except for Peggy.
	One attempt after another, they try to either capture her or kill her until finally, they succeed. But she isnt dead. Now in the hospital, she must make a decision. Should she return to Ravenswood or should she run?
	These are just the stepping stones in Red Dreams. There are quite a few people you will read about, and as for a few of them, you will never hear of them again. There is a lot to this story and the path to understand it all will take time." />
