  <title>Julio:  a Brooklyn Boy Plays Detective to Find His Missing Father - John Carter, Robert Eidelberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Brooklyn Boy Plays Detective to Find His Missing Father, writer and editor Robert Eidelberg has added 
thought-provoking questions throughout the pages of 
John Carters original story (theyre set off to the side here and there); these questions are intended to prompt you, the reader, to engage in some detecting, some reflecting, and even some expecting during the novels development of character, plot, 
and point of view. 
These provocative questions all appear under WERE YOU WONDERING? headings because they are just the sort of questions that good readers generally wonder about when they read mysteries (actually, when they read all kinds of stories).  Good readers look closely (detect) in order to know; they think more fully (reflect) about what theyve noticed in order to understand what it most likely means; and they predict (mindfully expect) by using the details of a story and their own experiences and knowledge to guess at what will probably happen next." />
