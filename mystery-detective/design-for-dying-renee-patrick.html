  <title>Design for Dying - Renee Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles, 1937. Lillian Frost has traded dreams of stardom for security as a department store salesgirl . . . until she discovers she&#39;s a suspect in the murder of her former roommate, Ruby Carroll. Party girl Ruby died wearing a gown she stole from the wardrobe department at Paramount Pictures, domain of Edith Head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edith has yet to win the first of her eight Academy Awards; right now she&#39;s barely hanging on to her job, and a scandal is the last thing she needs. To clear Lillian&#39;s name and save Edith&#39;s career, the two women join forces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the mystery pits them against a Hungarian princess on the lam, a hotshot director on the make, and a private investigator who&#39;s not on the level. All they have going for them are dogged determination, assists from the likes of Bob Hope and Barbara Stanwyck, and a killer sense of style. In show business, that just might be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  first in a series of riveting behind-the-scenes mysteries, Renee Patrick&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Design for Dying &lt;/i&gt;is a delightful romp through Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
