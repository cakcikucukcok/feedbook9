  <title>Four Strange Women - E.R. Punshon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“You think it’s murder, don’t you?”“There is no proof of that as yet, sir,” Bobby answered cautiously.“No, I know, but it’s what you think,” Glynne answered. After a pause, he added: “So do I.” Viscount Byatt was found dead in his car without a mark on him. Millionaire Andy White’s corpse was discovered in a remote cottage in Wales - no clue to the cause of death. When a grotesque-looking visitor calls on Detective-Sergeant Bobby Owen in the middle of the night, the latter’s help is urgently needed - if a third young man isn’t to suffer the same murderous and mystifying fate. Accompanied by his fiancée Olive Farrar, Bobby is up against more than one femme fatale in this delicious and diabolical golden age mystery.Four Strange Women, originally published in 1940, is the fourteenth novel in the Bobby Owen mystery series. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.“What is distinction? The few who achieve it step - plot or no plot - unquestioned into the first rank… in the works of Mr. E.R. Punshon we salute it every time.” Dorothy L. Sayers" />
