      <meta name="description" content="On a spring afternoon, the crumpled body of a very old woman lay dead at the foot of the stairs in her home in the Hollywood Hills.&lt;br&gt;
Jessie Mitchell, the old woman&#39;s widowed daughter in law, mourned the death as Bitty had been like a mother to her even before Jessie had married one of Bitty&#39;s grandsons. &lt;br&gt;
After a frantic two weeks when Jessie and Wilma, Bitty&#39;s housekeeper, followed a list of funeral instructions left by Bitty. The funeral luncheon was finally over. &lt;br&gt;
Matthew Grainger, Bitty&#39;s lawyer, spoke with any belligerent relatives that wanted things immediately settled, and informed them that the will would not be read until the grandson, Charles Mitchell was located and present. &lt;br&gt;
Following a series of frightening later events, the police suggested Jessie visit friends. She agreed. &lt;br&gt;
So, Jessie started searching for Charley." />
