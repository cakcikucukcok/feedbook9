  <title>Purger - Ginger R. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conway retires from the FBI at the age of sixty.  He takes with him copies of reports hed come across when he had been investigating murders.  He begins to track a particular hit man believed to be responsible for many of those murders.
       Brian Purger is a free-lance hit man.  His survival depends on his cunning and strength.  He finds peace only at his New Hampshire mountain retreat.
       Bill is the closest thing to a friend Purger has ever had.  Bill is a college graduate and works for a large company.  He is a widower with a young daughter and values family life above all else.  He is in love with Leigh but is worried she will find out about his friendship with Purger.
       Leigh is divorced, a working mother with two children.  She is insecure and wants more than anything to have her children grow up with a father figure in the home.  She loves Bill and thinks he is the answer to making her family complete.  
       Bill takes Leigh on a romantic skiing trip to a remote New England mountain and finds that a blizzard is closing in.  Bill has never told Leigh that Purger also has a cabin on the mountain.  The ski holiday soon intrudes into Purger&#39;s reclusive life.  He tells Bill that he will eliminate the woman if she gets too close.  He believes he will be doing his friend a favor.  He threatens to kill Bill too if he gets in the way. 
       Bill warns Leigh and tells her about Purger but they cannot escape in the car because of the blizzard.  They decide to ski down the mountain to safety.  When Bill disappears during the trip, Leigh realizes she is alone on the mountain, with a professional killer in pursuit." />
