  <title>Kiss Her Goodbye - Harvey Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Houston Cash is an ex-cop turned private investigator who doesnt expect his life to be
extraordinary, and thats just how he likes it. But thats rarely how it seems to work out for him. His cases tend to take him places where he has to
employ his skills, his sense of humor, and his sense of right and wrong to maximum effect to solve the problems of the interesting people who walk through his door. Though his network of friends and contacts help him navigate the labyrinths he encounters, it almost always boils down to Houstons own abilities to see a case
through to the end. &lt;p&gt;
When Houston makes the acquaintance of a bank executives wife, he finds himself thrust in a world of money, sex, murder, and double-crosses; its just another day for a detective (or so it seems). But this woman is about to lead him on a path of twists and
turns with an unexpected finale, and not everyone survives. Can Houstons instincts help him stay out of too much of the trouble she represents?" />
