  <title>The Trust - Ronald H. Balson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A thrilling, action-filled suspense novel.... Those who loved Balson&#39;s other books like &lt;i&gt;Once We Were Brothers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Karolina&#39;s Twins &lt;/i&gt;will love this latest entry.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Trust&lt;/i&gt;, from Ronald H. Balson, the international bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Once We Were Brothers&lt;/i&gt;, finds private investigator Liam Taggart returning to his childhood home for an uncle&#39;s funeral, only to discover his death might not have been natural.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his uncle dies, Liam Taggart reluctantly returns to his childhood home in Northern Ireland for the funeral--a home he left years ago after a bitter confrontation with his family, never to look back. But when he arrives, Liam learns that not only was his uncle shot to death, but that he&#39;d anticipated his own murder: In an astonishing last will and testament, Uncle Fergus has left his entire estate to a secret trust, directing that no distributions be made to any person until the killer is found. Did Fergus know, but refuse to name, his killer? Was this a crime of revenge, a vendetta leftover from Northern Ireland&#39;s bloody sectarian war? After all, the Taggarts were deeply involved in the IRA.  Or is it possible that the killer is a family member seeking Fergus&#39;s estate?  Otherwise, why postpone distributions to the heirs? Most menacingly, does the killer now have his sights on other family members? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his investigation draws Liam farther and farther into the past he has abandoned, he realizes he is forced to reopen doors long ago shut and locked. Now, accepting the appointment as sole trustee of the Fergus Taggart Trust, Liam realizes he has stepped into the center of a firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;" />
