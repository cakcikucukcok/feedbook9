  <title>The Phoenix Prescription - David William Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Isolated in a New England hospital by the Blizzard of 1978, training surgeon Timothy Voight becomes solely responsible for two injured lovers. Danny Ferrone drives to Eastport north of Boston with his fiance, Ashley Laughton, to counsel his brother, Tony, a Vietnam Vet about Tony&#39;s dark war secret. His Porsche crashes. Danny is terribly burned. Ashley is comatose with a serious head-injured. The brother&#39;s father, Anthony Ferrone, the most powerful lawyer in Massachusetts, insists Danny be transferred to Boston. Tony sees similarities between his brother&#39;s injuries and those he saw in the jungle. The blizzard hammers New England, isolating Voight with no surgeons to guide him. Only his nemesis, neurosurgeon Bruce Chalmers, remains in-house. Voight hatches a unique treatment scheme involving the two lovers, a Phoenix-like prescription. But, Chalmers disagrees on what&#39;s best for Danny and Ashley. Danny plunges into shock. Voight must make a choice between succumbing to threats from Anthony and Bruce Chalmers to transfer Danny in the storm or perform a radical operation by himself to save Danny&#39;s life. Voight decides. Then, Tony enters the picture. He reveals his secret to Danny in his brother&#39;s isolation room. The brothers make an impossible decision." />
