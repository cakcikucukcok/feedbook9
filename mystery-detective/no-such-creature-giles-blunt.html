  <title>No Such Creature - Giles Blunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver Dagger winner Giles Blunt delivers an exhilarating game of cat and mouse with a most unlikely--and likeable--pair of thieves&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Owen Maxwell was saved from a foster home by the arrival of his uncle Max from England. Once a promising Shakespearean actor, Magnus &quot;Max&quot; Maxwell has since put his dramatic skills to new use: a master of disguise, a virtuoso of foreign dialects, and a performer to his core, he has become an extremely successful gentleman thief. Every summer, Max and Owen take a road trip across the United States, pulling off elaborate robberies along the way. But this year is different. Their first, dazzlingly executed summer heist captures the interest of the Subtractors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long believed an urban myth, the Subtractors are a gang of vicious thieves who prey on other thieves. They will abduct a fellow crook known to have completed a lucrative job and proceed to &quot;subtract&quot; parts of his body until he tells them where they can find the loot. &quot;No such creature,&quot; Max says, when Owen first suspects that they may be in the Subtractors&#39; sights. But in this, as in so many things, Max will prove to be disastrously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;" />

They pick a new route, hop in their giant Winnebago, and take in the tourist sites the same as any typical family.<br /><b><i>No Such Creature | Giles Blunt</i></b> | Although none of the key players are full blooded though they bleed, NO SUCH CREATURE is a zany crime caper that seems on the verge of going out of control, but never quite does. Leaving Canada for the States (giving Homicide Detectives John Cardinal and Lise Delorme a breather), Giles Blunt provides an over the top chess game between violent criminals and rakish criminals.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: No Such Creature: A Novel (9780805080629 ...</i></b> | I have read and enjoyed immensely the entire Giles Blunt collection of novels. "No Such Creature", is a stand alone that is totally different from the John Cardinal series. This novel has a humorous side to it, has a much lighter concept which is mixed with serious and sad moments.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>No Such Creature - Giles Blunt</a> </h3></p><hr/>
