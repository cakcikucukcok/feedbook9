  <title>The Gilded Web - J. R. Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the spring of 1980, and Waynesville State University students Jeremy McCutchin and Rodney Blake have just spent two glorious weeks in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. They are returning to New York and to school when the unthinkable happens. The two best friendsone white and one blackare nearing the end of their prescribed 600-miles-per-day driving limit when they feel the new 1980 black convertible hit something on the dark stretch of county road.
They investigate, see nothing, and decide the best course of action is to report the incident to the authorities. In this small town of 595 people, Jeremy and Rodney report the incident to Sheriff Relliford. He tells them there is probably nothing to worry about, but impounds their car for good measure.
But the sheriff is mistaken. The boys are charged with vehicular homicide and must defend themselves in court. In this time of racial turmoil in the United States, Jeremy and Rodney fight for their freedom and come of age in a very difficult way." />
