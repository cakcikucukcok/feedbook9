  <title>Perfect Son - Victoria Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finding herself caught in the economic crisis in her own mediation practice, Lynzee Rose joins forces with Thurston County Detective, Carl Watson, as an empathic mediator turned civilian consultant. Their specialty: The unnatural and the bizarre.
No stranger to family dysfunction, personal loss, or struggles with spirituality, Lynzee finds herself a reluctant expert on suspicious deaths thus proving even screwed up people can do good. 
In a story set against the backdrop of Washingtons beautiful and mysterious Pacific Northwest, Lynzee sets out to solve a crime scene mystery at the equally mysterious Mima Mounds, calling on her own personal shortcomings for support.
Discover the natural, and not so natural, local wonder of Mima Mounds, prairie lands full of thousands of closely-packed Mounds of Mystery with as many ongoing theories as to their origin as there are mounds. And, experience her quirky lifestyle at Johnson Point Community, an outdoor focused living community, modern day Walden Pond style." />
