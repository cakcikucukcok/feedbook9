  <title>A Matter of Conscience - James Bartleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A novel of love and betrayal dealing with the biggest issues facing Canada’s Indigenous peoples today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In the summer of 1972, a float plane carrying a team of child welfare officials lands on a river flowing through the Yellow Dog Indian reserve. Their mission is to seize the twin babies of an Indigenous couple as part of an illegal scheme cooked up by the federal government to adopt out tens of thousands of Native children to white families. The baby girl, Brenda, is adopted and raised by a white family in Orillia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Meanwhile, that same summer, a baby boy named Greg is born to a white middle-class family. At the age of eighteen, Greg leaves home for the first time to earn money to help pay for his university expenses. He drinks heavily and becomes embroiled in the murder of a female student from a residential school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The destinies of Brenda and Greg intersect in this novel of passion confronting the murder and disappearance of Indigenous women and the infamous Sixties Scoop." />
