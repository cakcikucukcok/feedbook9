  <title>The Absence of Friends - Andrew R. Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A cryptic but revealing diary entry, penned by an anonymous hand.
A killer in the midst of a group of friends, waiting for their moment to strike.
A body  but why would they be the killers intended victim?
The identities of all three are left as a guessing game-right until the climatic
and dramatic ending. This sets the foundations that The Absence of Friends
uses in a whodunit with a chilling twist.
The story spans more than four decades prior, following the lives and loves
of each of the main characters as they all find themselves colliding into one
anothers worlds and into the crux of a hellish nightmare that none will allow themselves to ever forget.
Shocking revelations come to the fore as each characters past is delved into and unravelled, taking us straight to the heart of their exciting highs
and tense lows.
Nail-biting tension mounts as the final tragedy strikes, leading us into an
explosive finale that you wouldnt ever have seen coming.
But with such strong bonds being forged amongst the friends,
- who has the motive to kill?
- who is their intended victim?
- and who is the mysterious diary writer?" />
