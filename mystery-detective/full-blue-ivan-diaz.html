Victors uncle, MITCHELL LEN, a middle-aged detective trying to make a difference in blue, moves back into the same Lower East Side neighborhood and is drawn into an unwanted high-profile homicide, and corrupt election, that is somehow linked to Victors battle with Rudolph and, maybe, even the mayor and big business.
Mitchell and Victor take a Dantean journey into the inferno that is New York City politics, and find that they are inextricably linked with very ambitious women and menone of whom is a deadly international terroristin a game that adds new meaning to the usual suspects and operating in the gray area of life, lechery and the law... in a game that could get them both killed." />
