  <title>Buy a Bullet - Gregg Hurwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Nowhere Man is a figure shrouded in secrecy--a near legendary figure who helps those lucky few who are given the means to reach out to him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before he was the Nowhere Man, Evan Smoak was a highly trained government operative known to a few as Orphan X. This is the story of Smoak&#39;s first outing as the Nowhere Man, where after a gear run to Northern California, he happens to spot a young woman at a coffee shop. Brutalized and under the control of a very powerful, unscrupulous man, she knows her life is in danger if she doesn&#39;t escape. And the only person who can help her do that is a man with the background and skills of the Nowhere Man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Gregg Hurwitz comes an electrifying story.  Also contains an extended excerpt from the Orphan X thriller--&lt;i&gt;The Nowhere Man&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
