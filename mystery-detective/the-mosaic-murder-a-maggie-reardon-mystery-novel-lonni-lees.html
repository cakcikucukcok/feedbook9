  <title>The Mosaic Murder: A Maggie Reardon Mystery Novel - Lonni Lees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The artists&#39; reception at the popular Mosaic Gallery in Tucson, Arizona is a great success, but the next morning, when the body of Armando, the owner&#39;s husband, is discovered, things start turning ugly. Every artist becomes a suspect, and each of them has their own reason to want the man out of the picture. But who disliked him enough to want him dead? And who stole the fake Mexican artifacts and the sculpture of the goddess Gaia? Gallery owner Barbara Atwell is devastated at her young husband&#39;s death, and turns to her friends, Adrian and Rocco, for support. An unseasonal Arizona heat wave keeps everyone&#39;s nerves on edge as Police Detective Maggie Reardon juggles a disastrous personal life while trying to solve the crime. She even finds herself attracted to one of the suspects as she sifts through a long list of colorful, Bohemian characters to determine who had the ultimate motive for murder. But when she&#39;s viciously attacked in her own home, she begins wondering whether she&#39;ll survive long enough to find the culprit. The first of a great series of detective novels set in the sizzling Southwest!" />
