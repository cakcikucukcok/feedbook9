  <title>The Ash Murders: Supernatural Mystery Stories - Edmund Glasby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to eyewitnesses, the victim was sitting on a park bench and talking loudly in a foreign language when he suddenly got to his feet and started flailing his arms around. Then his head fell off and the rest of his body became a human torch. By the time the police arrive, all that remains is a pile of smoldering ashes, along with an unscathed severed head. For Detective Inspector John Dryer, the unexplained death represents one of the toughest cases of his career. Was the man murdered, or the victim of some horrible accident? Other stories in this collection of supernatural mysteries include: &quot;Souls of the Frozen,&quot; &quot;Calling All Weaklings!&quot;, &quot;Pale Lilac,&quot; and &quot;Volume XIII.&quot; Great reading by the author of THE DYRYSGOL HORROR." />
