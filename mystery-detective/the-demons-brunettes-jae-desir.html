  <title>The Demons &amp; Brunettes - Jae Desir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rescued from a dangerous life and abusive boyfriend, Gabriel, Noemi is happy as can be with her newfound lover, Marvin, in Atlanta, Georgia. She can finally smile now, live happy, and breathe easy with her husband and daughter. But all good things go bad when her past life come back to haunt her. Her former partner would rather die than see her breathe happy with another man. He ends Noemis and her husbands life, leaving baby Amy alive. Amy is snatched from her parents life by force. The same persons who ended her parents life are the same ones who raise her as their own. They move her away from her parents family, holding her hostage in Canada. Things arent always what they seem, and when she is forced to get adopted by the Reeves, her life automatically changes for better and worse. Get involved in the on-and-off chase tale of Amy Sullivan and her sister and friends as they fall irrevocably in love with their own demon. Everything has a price, and when you love something as alluring and deadly as them, your love ones slowly vanish, and your world turns completely dark.
This is only the beginning." />
