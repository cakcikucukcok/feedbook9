  <title>Remember the Scorpion - Isaac  Goldemberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lima, 1970: a tremendous earthquake has just struck the Peruvian capital, and mayhem reigns. Tensions are high, with a population reeling from the disaster and mesmerized by the World Cup. Enter detective Simon Weiss, tasked with solving two seemingly unrelated murders: the crucifying and beheading of a Japanese man in a pool hall and an apparent murder-by-hanging of an elderly Jewish man. Joined by Lieutenant Kato Kanashiro, whose deep ties to Japanese-Peruvian culture inform the case in surprisingly personal ways, Weiss traces the histories of two very different criminals and their crimes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Weiss is haunted by the trauma of a childhood partly spent in a German concentration camp. Weiss is troubled &amp;#151; boozing, coke-snorting, and vengeful. He is unfaithful to his prostitute lover and takes up with a younger, married woman who is a fellow survivor of the Holocaust. Weiss and Kanashiro&#39;s banter is hilariously recorded with Goldemberg&amp;#8217;s deadpan police procedural narration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beyond a simple pulp, &lt;I&gt;Remember the Scorpion&lt;/I&gt; tracks the wreckage of the Second World War and reconstructs it in the conflicted psyche of a South American detective. Weiss must uncover the relation between the perpetrators and their crimes, while searching deep within himself to conquer his own demons.&lt;/div&gt;" />
