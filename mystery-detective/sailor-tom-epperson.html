  <title>Sailor - Tom Epperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed novelist of &lt;i&gt;The Kind One&lt;/i&gt; and screenwriter of such films as &lt;i&gt;One False Move&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Gift,&lt;/i&gt; Tom Epperson brings the violence-soaked world of Cormac McCarthy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;No Country for Old Men &lt;/i&gt;and the heroism of Jack Schaefer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Shane&lt;/i&gt; together to create an iconic action thriller for the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gina fell for the wrong guy. Joe came into her life promising her everything, and he gave it to her, along with a world of hell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gina was stronger than Joe realized. After years of suffering the terror of being married to a criminal, she took the one thing he ever gave her that she wanted--her son, Luke. Then she turned the bastard in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her husband behind bars, her father-in-law will stop at nothing for revenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants his grandson back, the heir to his criminal empire. With a vast network that stretches across the country, every favor is called in to kill Gina and return Luke to his grandfather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gina can trust no one. Even the U.S. Marshall assigned to keep Gina and Luke safe is on the payroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with a gun and stolen diamonds in her purse, and derelicts, the law, and hit men on her tail, Gina takes Luke and runs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles was only supposed to be a quick stop--sleep, eat, and continue running--but then they meet Gray.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he&#39;s a sailor, but he seems to be hiding a lot. And when the time comes, he&#39;s the only thing standing between her and the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
