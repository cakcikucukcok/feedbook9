  <title>Sham Rock - Ralph McInerny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The University of Notre Dame relies on Roger Knight, the rotund professor of Catholic Studies, and his brother Philip, a semiretired PI, to investigate certain delicate situations that could put the school in a bad light. Students, faculty, and alumni, like David Williams, are all fair game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been a successful financial adviser until recently, David has returned to campus to renege on a pledged donation to the university&#39;s ethics program. While he&#39;s there, one of his former classmates sends a letter confessing to the murder and a secret burial of one of their closest friends, a student who had gone missing decades before and was never found. As students, David, Patrick, and Timothy made up the &quot;Trinity,&quot; an irreverent nickname for three close friends and fierce rivals---be it for on-campus prestige or the affections of a beautiful St. Mary&#39;s student from across the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to help the school put the whole sordid tragedy behind them, Roger and Philip set about the sad task of unearthing Timothy&#39;s body, only to find that they have a much bigger mystery with which to contend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rivalries rekindled and the brothers Knight digging into the university&#39;s past, &lt;i&gt;Sham Rock&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in Ralph McInerny&#39;s well-loved mystery series, is as witty and charming as ever&lt;/p&gt;" />
