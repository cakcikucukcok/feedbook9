  <title>Shot In Detroit - Patricia Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Nominated for the Edgar Award&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div&gt;Violet Hart is a photographer who has always returned to cobble out a life for herself in the oddly womblike interiors of Detroit. Nearing forty, she&amp;#8217;s keenly aware that the time for artistic recognition is running out.  When her lover, Bill, a Detroit mortician, needs a photograph of a body, she agrees to takes the picture. It&amp;#8217;s an artistic success and Violet is energized by the subject matter, persuading Bill to allow her to take pictures of some of his other &amp;#147;clients,&amp;#8221; eventually settling on photographing young, black men.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Violet&amp;#8217;s new portfolio is launched, she quickly strikes a deal, agreeing to produce a dozen pictures with a short deadline, confident because dead bodies are commonplace in Detroit and she has access to the city&amp;#8217;s most prominent mortician. These demands soon place Violet in the position of having to strain to meet her quota.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As time runs out, how will Violet come up with enough subjects to photograph without losing her soul or her life in the process? A riveting novel of psychological suspense, Patricia Abbott continues to cement herself as one of our very best writers of the darkness that lies within the human heart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
