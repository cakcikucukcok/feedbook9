  <title>Evilution - Lisa Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evilution is a story that looks into man&#39;s inherent struggle to control his dark, primal nature in order to fit into society. Maximillian VanderCreek is a mysterious and handsome new graduate student with a dark hidden past. A genetic mutation has changed him. We follow his evilution from birth to the present day. Recent events have inexplicably brought him back to his childhood farm in Franklin New York and to attend classes at Hills College. He finds himself drawn to his Professor, Lillian Bean. As their two lives become entwined they will find they have a connection deeper then the love that grows between them. A primal force has united them together; something in their very biology connects them. Fate will play a hand when Max gives Lily a special gift, one that harnesses the power of a goddess. As the story unfolds the reader learns of a sinister presence that is a link to both of their pasts, one that holds the key to understanding their deep connection. In the end, Max&#39;s dark history catches up to his present and threatens his future with Lily. Will the darkness consume them both? Could their love be enough to overcome the evil nature that hides just below the surface? Step into the world of Max and Lily as their story of love and lies, truths revealed, and powerful forces at work, weave a tale with a surprise ending that will leave you yearning for the next installment." />
