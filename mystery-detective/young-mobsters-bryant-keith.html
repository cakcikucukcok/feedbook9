  <title>Young Mobsters - Bryant Keith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its the mid eighties and they call him ColoDog, born in Chicago as Columbus George. His name is too distinctive, to be a working criminal in the hood.  He needed a handle for street guys.  He falls in with a group of thieves and killers on 169th St, and created havoc.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;All of the boys have two commonalities.  No father in the household, facing hard lifes decisions and fallen dreams.  Columbus family and some friends dont trust him, because hes has the thief tag. Colo doesnt steal from family and friends.  Colo knows the numbers.  He knows growing up Black, doesnt put life odds in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His parent kicked him out.  Now hes living in snake alley in his broken down car.  He goes to his street family, family for help, GDs and BDs mothers looked out..  He wakes from his wickedness when Mrs. Bilkins who lives on Calumet, foretells his future.  She sees him being a bum or in jail. He could sell dope, but the dope man wont let him.  The dope man is Mrs. Bilkins son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ColoDogs weed game will not provide housing, food and clothes.  He entertains going down a pathway he said hed never go!  Let see what Colo does, while facing broken dreams, tragedies and strife?  He still has an enormous will, to survive his predicament.  He goes to Yahweh for his answers!!!&lt;/p&gt;" />
