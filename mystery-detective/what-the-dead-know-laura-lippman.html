  <title>What the Dead Know - Laura Lippman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author returns to the compelling terrain of &lt;em&gt;Every Secret Thing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To the Power of Three &lt;/em&gt;with this indelible story of crime and vengeance in which the past becomes all-too-present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he&amp;#8217;s called to the scene of an accident detective Kevin Infante is drawn into a shocking and puzzling crime that still haunts the Baltimore P.D. Twenty years ago, two little girls were kidnapped from a shopping mall, igniting fear and anger throughout the city.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a clearly disoriented woman involved in the accident claims to be one of the missing girls. But instead of closing the case, her appearance marks the beginning of a nightmare that will once again rock Baltimore and threaten everyone it touches. The woman claims one of Baltimore&amp;#8217;s beloved cops snatched her and her sister. Is it the truth-or the ravings of a damaged mind? There isn&amp;#8217;t a shred of evidence to support her story: The cop is dead and her parents can&amp;#8217;t verify the woman is even their daughter, for both girls were adopted and do not share their DNA. And who is the body in the unmarked grave the girl reveals?&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the department&amp;#8217;s reputation, a dead man&amp;#8217;s honor, and his own badge on the line, Infante must go back to a past he barely knows to find answers&amp;#8212;and maybe even justice&amp;#8212;once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
