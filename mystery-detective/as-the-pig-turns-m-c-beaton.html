  <title>As the Pig Turns - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An irresistible new adventure for the bossy, vain, and endearing Agatha Raisin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;--now the star of a hit show on Acorn TV and public television--&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;from &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling M.C. Beaton, &quot;the reigning queen of the cozies&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (Booklist).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter Parva is a &quot;picturesque&quot; (touristy) Cotswold village with gift shops, a medieval market hall, and thatched cottages. After a disappointing Christmas season, the parish council has decided to hold a special event in January, complete with old-fashioned costumes, morris dancing, and a pig roast on the village green.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always one for a good roasting, Agatha Raisin organizes an outing to enjoy the merriment. The rotary spit turning over a bed of blazing charcoals is sure to please on this foggy and blistery evening. But as the fog lifts slightly, the sharp-eyed Agatha notices something peculiar about the pig: a tattoo of a heart with an arrow through it and the name Amy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop!&quot; she screams suddenly. &quot;Pigs don&#39;t have tattoos.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;pig,&quot; in fact, is Gary Beech, a policeman not exactly beloved by the locals, including Agatha herself. Although Agatha has every intention of leaving matters to the police, everything changes when the Gary&#39;s ex-wife, Amy, hires Agatha&#39;s detective agency to investigate--and another murder ensues. With that provocation, how could any sleuth as vain and competitive (and secretly insecure) as Agatha do anything other than solve the case herself?&lt;/p&gt;" />

Beaton's Agatha Raisin series. After a while you become attached to the characters with all their quirks and personalities. "As the Pig Turns" is just like all other Agatha Raisin stories, but this is a good thing! The stories are wonderful - a middle-aged woman who is vain, attracted to romance, and in general a flawed human being.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>As the Pig Turns - M.
