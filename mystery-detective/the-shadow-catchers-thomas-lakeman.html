  <title>The Shadow Catchers - Thomas Lakeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FBI Special Agent Mike Yeager is in trouble. His most recent case---a child kidnapping, his usual---ended tragically, and the FBI has suspended him. Worse, Mike can&#39;t seem to forgive himself. He&#39;s run away from everything he knows in Philadelphia to the mountains of Nevada in an attempt to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in Nevada, he&#39;s stumbled into the world of a killer: in the small town of San Cristobal, one child was killed accidentally---or so it seems---a few weeks before Mike&#39;s arrival. The day after he shows up, an adult is murdered, and soon another child disappears. Mike doesn&#39;t want to get involved, but he can&#39;t help himself, first because as a stranger in town he&#39;s got to prove to the local law enforcement that he&#39;s not the killer, and second, because he&#39;s in the perfect place to solve the case and redeem himself in the eye of the FBI. Not to mention that at least one more child&#39;s life is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lakeman is one of those rare talents who has composed a first novel that doesn&#39;t read like a debut at all, but instead is written with the precision and tightly drawn suspense of one of the genre&#39;s masters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
