      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The electrifying follow up to the award-winning&lt;/i&gt; Raven Black&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raven Black&lt;/i&gt; received crime fiction&#39;s highest monetary honor, the Duncan Lawrie Dagger Award. Now Detective Jimmy Perez is back in an electrifying sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s midsummer in the Shetland Islands, the time of the white nights, when birds sing at midnight and the sun never sets. Artist Bella Sinclair throws an elaborate party to launch an exhibition of her work at The Herring House, a gallery on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party ends in farce when one the guests, a mysterious Englishman, bursts into tears and claims not to know who he is or where he&#39;s come from. The following day the Englishman is found hanging from a rafter, and Detective Jimmy Perez is convinced that the man has been murdered. He is reinforced in this belief when Roddy, Bella&#39;s musician nephew, is murdered, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the detective&#39;s relationship with Fran Hunter may have clouded his judgment, for this is a crazy time of the year when night blurs into day and nothing is quite as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stunning second installment in the acclaimed Shetland Island Quartet, &lt;i&gt;White Nights&lt;/i&gt; is sure to garner American raves for international sensation Ann Cleeves. This series is the basis for the hit BBC show &lt;i&gt;Shetland, &lt;/i&gt;starring Douglas Henshall, which attracted over 12 million viewers in its first two nights on the air.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>White Nights - Ann Cleeves</i></b> | Another really pleasurable read from Ann Cleeves. White Nights features many of the same characters as its prequel Raven Black, but this time is set in summer, a time when the daylight in the Shetland Isles is practically endless and the people are said to go a little crazy. I really enjoy the main character, Inspector Jimmy Perez.<br /><b><i>White Nights (Shetland Island, #2) by Ann Cleeves</i></b> | White Nights, the second book in Ann Cleeves' 'Shetland Quartet' featuring detective Jimmy Perez<br /><b><i>Ann Cleeves: White Nights, the second book in the Shetland ...</i></b> | Ann Cleeves is one of those rare birds. The TV show "Vera" made her more popular, but the first entry in this, Shetland series brought her a Dagger award. The second novel in this original series is very good. I see that people complain about the same thing everybody else complains these days.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>White Nights - Ann Cleeves</a> </h3></p><hr/>
