  <title>When Thunder Rolls - Dawn Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1997 at a Bible college in Grantville, Pennsylvania, Dawn first set eyes on Jacob Cole. She didnt know it then, but God had a special plan in mind for the two of them. In When Thunder Rolls, Dawn tells their love storyfrom their early friendship to the day Jacob died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story of relationships and loss, When Thunder Rolls narrates Dawns journey through a heartbreaking trial in her life that drew her into a deeper walk with Christ. They were married in 2001 and were happy for several years. But the young couples life changed in 2008 when Jacob was diagnosed with malignant melanoma and died just a year later. This memoir tells how that experience forever changed Dawn, who became a young widow and single mother to four children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her personal testimony, Dawn encourages others facing deep trials to know they are not alone and that with Gods strength within them they will come through. And as they yield their hearts to Him and trust Him no matter what, God will be glorified.&lt;/p&gt;" />
