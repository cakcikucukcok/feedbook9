  <title>Fifty Years in Chains - Charles Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Fifty Years in Chains: Or, the Life of an American Slave&lt;/i&gt; (1859) was an abridged and unauthorized reprint of the earlier &lt;i&gt;Slavery in the United States&lt;/i&gt; (1836). In the narratives, Ball describes his experiences as a slave, including the uncertainty of slave life and the ways in which the slaves are forced to suffer inhumane conditions. He recounts the qualities of his various masters and the ways in which his fortune depended on their temperament. As slave narrative scholar William L. Andrews has noted, Ball&#39;s oft-repeated narrative directly influenced the manner and matter of later fugitive slave narratives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DOCSOUTH BOOK. This collaboration between UNC Press and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library brings classic works back into print. DocSouth Books editions are selected from the digital library of Documenting the American South and are unaltered from the original publication. The DocSouth series uses digital technology to offer e-books and print-on-demand publications, providing affordable and accessible editions to a new generation of scholars, students, and general readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
