  <title>Whitman: A Study - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is John Burroughs&#39; 1896 biographical treatise of Walt Whitman, &quot;Whitman: A Study&quot;. It constitutes a profound and comprehensive insight into the mind and work of one of America&#39;s greatest poets by another of America&#39;s great men of letters. This fantastic book is highly recommended for all lovers of literature, and it is not to be missed by fans of Burroughs&#39; work. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Contents include: &quot;Whitman&quot;, &quot;Preliminary&quot;, &quot;Biographical And Personal&quot;, &quot;His Ruling Ideas And Aims&quot;, &quot;His Self-reliance&quot;, &quot;His Relation To Life And Morals&quot;, &quot;His Relation To Culture&quot;, &quot;His Relation To His Country And His Times&quot;, &quot;His Relation To Science&quot;, &quot;His Relation To Religion&quot;, and &quot;A Final Word&quot;. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
