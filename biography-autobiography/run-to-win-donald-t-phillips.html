  <title>Run to Win - Donald T. Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vince Lombardi, whom many believe to be the greatest football coach in the history of the sport, is both a household name and an icon.  He is not only renowned in the sports world, but also in business and industry for his exceptional leadership skills.  In &lt;i&gt;Run to Win&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed author Don Phillips examines Lombardi&#39;s famous coaching style by painting a picture of a fascinating individual, a man whose ingenious leadership helped lead his teams to nine playoff victories in a row, including wins in the first two Super Bowls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extracting powerful lessons from a man who could both lead and inspire, Phillips gets to the heart of what made Lombardi great and shows readers what it takes to be a winner.  At the same time, this groundbreaking book tells the inspiring story of Lombardi&#39;s ten-year career with the Green Bay Packers and Washington Redskins, complete with anecdotes, quotes, and Lombardi Principles that show why this legendary coach continues to be a role model for effective leadership in business today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Totally accessible and utterly fascinating, Donald T. Phillips&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Run to Win&lt;/i&gt; empowers readers with the knowledge to succeed in business, while entertaining them with tales of a man whose ability to win under any circumstance is unsurpassed in the history of professional sports.&lt;/p&gt;" />
