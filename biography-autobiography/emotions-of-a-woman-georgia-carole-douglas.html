  <title>Emotions of a Woman - Georgia Carole Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The poems in this collection were written in reflection.  They portray the authors deepest emotions about &quot;what living will surely do.&quot;  She began writing them at a time in life when she felt as if she were &quot;coming into her own.&quot;  Moving to central Illinois with her husband, she decided to do something other than teaching and began work in a greenhouse.  That&#39;s when she discovered the true blend in her personality. Mother&#39;s affinity with plants, Dad&#39;s sales ability, and their joy of meeting people.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The city of Springfield proved to be a beautiful place to live, the history of it, intriguing. Happiness and contentment brought creativity to the surface and she began the &quot;Emotions&quot; collection.  She continues to write, often adding to a new collection, telling others that they may just end up a poem!&lt;/P&gt;
