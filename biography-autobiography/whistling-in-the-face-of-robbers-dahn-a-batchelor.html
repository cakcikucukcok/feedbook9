  <title>Whistling in the Face of Robbers - Dahn A. Batchelor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dahn A. Batchelor could have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but instead he was born into poverty, living the first year of his existence in a two room shack with no running water or electricity. In this first volume of his memoirs, author Dahn A. Batchelor shares the details of his lifefrom his birth in Toronto in 1933 to his eleventh year in 1944. This book is the first of six volumes of his memoirs. In this volume, he narrates the story of his childhood, which aside from being one of extreme poverty; he suffered from loneliness and several failures in school. But more than that, he has written about the events in history that encompassed his life along with the lives of his contemporaries. He describes what it was really like to live through the years of the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, and the Second World War. As Batchelor recalls his life from 1933 through to June 1944, you will get the feeling that you were there with him. Unbeknown to him during his childhood years, he would later play a role in society that had a profound effect on the lives of millions of people around the world." />
