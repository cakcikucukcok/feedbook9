  <title>Better Lives for Our Grandchildren - Bill Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A retired marketing executive of a $40 billion corporation, Bill Robertson has led an interesting life. Growing up in Niles, Michigan, he attended Harvard Business School, ran a marathon, scaled Mt. Rainier, played a round of golf with Neil Armstrong, met President Reagan, and made six holes in one. He also survived a devastating airline disaster aboard United Airlines Flight 232, which crashed in Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash changed his priorities and his life. Spending time with a growing family became his top concern, and he worried for the future of his six grandkids. The future looked bleak. His grandkids&amp;rsquo; generation might be the first to have a lower standard of living than their parents. This book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Better Lives for Our Grandchildren: A Plane Crash Survivor&amp;#39;s Perspective on Politics and Life&lt;/em&gt;, shows how he applied his extensive marketing experience to examine the direction of the country by taking the reader on the journey that led to the election of Donald J. Trump as president. The country wanted change, and Bill&amp;rsquo;s book identifies why there was so much angst and what the country is doing to change direction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
