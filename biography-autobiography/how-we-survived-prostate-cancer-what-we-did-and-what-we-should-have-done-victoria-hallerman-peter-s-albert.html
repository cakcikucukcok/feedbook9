  <title>How We Survived Prostate Cancer: What We Did and What We Should Have Done - Victoria Hallerman, Peter S. Albert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this unflinchingly honest account of one couple&#39;s struggles through prostate cancer, told from the wife&#39;s point of view, Victoria Hallerman writes poignantly of the six-year journey that changed the landscape of her and her husband&#39;s lives. She and Dean had been married 33 years when he got the news and underwent treatment that included radioactive seeds and hormone therapy, with severe and unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both a moving memoir and a supportive guidebook, How We Survived Prostate Cancer is a cautionary tale to make sure others don&#39;t make the same mistakes that Hallerman and her husband made along the way. It addresses everything from redefining intimacy to a wife&#39;s anger and loneliness in the face of her husband&#39;s illness, and offers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; A compelling personal story of one couple&#39;s difficulties and ill-informed choices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&quot;In Dean&#39;s Words&quot;: comments on the treatment and its aftermath &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;What We Know Now&quot;: nuggets of hard-won advice&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Interviews with wives of prostate cancer survivors&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Treatment options and suggested questions for doctors&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dr. Peter Albert&#39;s Top Ten List for Patients and Partners&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Comprehensive Glossary and Resource section&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;" />
