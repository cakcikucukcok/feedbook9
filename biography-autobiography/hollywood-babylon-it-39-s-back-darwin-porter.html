  <title>Hollywood Babylon--It&#39;s Back! - Darwin Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hottest compendium of inter-generational scandal in the history of Hollywood. An overview of exhibitionism, sexuality, and sin as filtered through 85 years of Hollywood indiscretion. As they were unfolding, the events described within this book were known only within Hollywood&#39;s most decadent cliques.  All of that has changed with the release of this book.From bisexual Elvis to cover-ups of murder, from the scandals of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age to the Hollywood of Here and Now.  It&#39;s all here.  Vivid, Candid, Sizzling. To those who love her, Hollywood was and is a gossipy, mendacious (Big Daddy&#39;s word), and whorish place that remains captivating despite the passage of time. In this, an updated new spin on Hollywood as Babylon, it&#39;s depicted at its sleaziest, most venal, and most deliciously unseemly. This monumentally exhaustive collection of sins, foibles, failings, and sexual adventures is the ultimate guilty pleasure-and publisher Blood Moon pledges that it&#39;s merely Volume One. --Books To Watch Out For" />
