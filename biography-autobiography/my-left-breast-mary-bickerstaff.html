  <title>My Left Breast - Mary Bickerstaff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She felt the ground shake beneath her as she learned of her diagnosis. Cancer had come knocking at her door. She chose to journal this great intruder. Putting one foot in front of the other, she came to know the healing in the universe. 
This mammoir chronicles a journey of healing. How precious is her left breast. She shares intimate details of medical interventions to save this beautiful little piece of herself that meant so much to her. She became vulnerable and strong at the same time. And now she chooses to invite others into her labyrinth to travel into the sacred center where she met Christ.
Silence, meditation, prayer, Reiki, nature, birds, bees, music, and sacred mountains all enfolded her and kept her from falling. But more than these, the many angels who walked this journey with her were the truest gifts, bearers of a sweet, healing balm.
She continues on the way of the labyrinth. Healing is embracing what she fears most and opening to what has been closed. As she moves about the earth, she learns to trust life and believes that her suffering may heal others. Arent we all bound together by the healing in the universe? 
She is not afraid of the future. She loves the Lord and knows that the Lord will rescue her, answer her, protect her, be with her in trouble, deliver her, and show her salvation.
Others may know this too. Each will have their own story to tell; each will be different, like a snowflake." />
