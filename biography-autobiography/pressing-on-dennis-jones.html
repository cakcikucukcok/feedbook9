  <title>Pressing On… - Dennis Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an autobiography of my life, in which I have shared different segments of time in order to reach out to those that may relate to my experiences. The idea of this book was heavy on my heart for a few years, due to the continued reports of sexual abuse that has been broadcast around our country. The reality that the total number of registered sex offenders in this nation has increased to staggering numbers, beckons for someone to try something to reverse this frightening trend. It is clear that a cycle of perversion has swept our country from generation to generation, harming many innocent victims along the way. It is my goal to create a tool that the Holy Spirit of God can use to change the wicked hearts of those caught in this cycle of perversion. 
My focus through this book is to share how I was freed from the bondages of sexual immorality. This book describes to the reader how the Lord Jesus worked in my heart and life. Using the wisdom of His Word to re-direct the choices I made on a daily basis. I was changed both mentally and spiritually and I have complete faith that the Lord can too change others overtaken in sexual immorality. This change is laid out in detail in hopes that those affected will learn from my mistakes in order to deter them from making the same mistakes." />
