  <title>Reverence - Janet Sassoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book tells the tale of a
seven-year-old girl who starts
to study ballet and dreams of
reaching her goal as prima ballerina.
She studied at the San Francisco Ballet
and is encouraged to dance. She started
in the opera when they needed a small
elf to go on stage where Salvatore
Baccaloni was sleeping under a tree,
with this small elf poking him in the
opera Falstaff. The blue lights were
enchanting, and every minute was
sheer heaven. This was the beginning
of a profession that demands total
dedication and love. It is fi lled with
anecdotes, laughter, and tears.
In writing this book, the author
describes what goes on in a company
that tours and dances every night on
different stages.
The author lives in San Francisco
with her husband, John R. Upton Jr.,
as well as in the Napa Valley where
John and his brother pioneered Three
Palms Vineyard, once the site of Lillie
Hitchcock Coits Napa Valley home." />
