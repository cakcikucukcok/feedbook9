  <title>Till Death Do Us Part - Derek A. Tong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This memoir shares one individuals journey and his testimony to the goodness of God. Entranced in the complexities of life, he was enjoying his childhooduntil the accident &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A head injury has these components: physical, behavioral, psychological, physiological, perceptual, emotional, spiritual, and cognitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Till Death Do Us Part&lt;/em&gt; explores&lt;/p&gt;
struggles for dealing with the head-injured;
physical aggression and rage and whether they can be overcome;
family dynamics;
hope for the head-injured community; and
conflict tips.
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will read of some tragic behavior and its consequences. May you experience Gods peace as the details are sewn together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With God all things are possible (Matthew 19:26 NIV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cursory glance at my life. It hones in on the head injury (TBI) I suffered as a youth. It traces my development into young adulthood and enters into my married life. My relationship with Dana is briefly romanticized and the arrival of our children glorified. The union with my beloved bride started to change dramatically over time. Often with the distractions in life, I lose my focus and then my cool. My head injury was the source of these changes. It became the greatest culprit of all. Unfortunately, my wife fell victim to my relentless physical aggression, albeit unintentionally. As the story unfolds, for my wife the question would be her reaction&lt;em&gt;Till Death Do Us Part&lt;/em&gt;  or not?&lt;/p&gt;" />
