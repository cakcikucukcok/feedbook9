  <title>The Puppy Diaries - Jill Abramson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An instructive and marvelously entertaining chronicle of a puppy&#39;s first year, by the executive editor of The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sparkling summer day, Jill Abramson brought home a nine-week-old golden retriever named Scout. Over the following year, as she and her husband raised their adorable new puppy, Abramson wrote a hugely popular column for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s website about the joys and challenges of training this rambunctious addition to their family. Dog-lovers from across the country inundated her with e-mails and letters, and the photos they sent in of their own dogs became the most visited photo album on the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s site in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Abramson has gone far beyond the material in her column and written a detailed and deeply personal account of Scout&#39;s first year. Part memoir, part manual, part investigative report, &lt;i&gt;The Puppy Diaries&lt;/i&gt; continues Abramson&#39;s intrepid reporting on all things canine. Along the way, she weighs in on such issues as breeders or shelters, adoption or rescue, raw diet or vegan, pack-leader gurus like Cesar Millan or positive-reinforcement advocates like Karen Pryor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you expect when a new puppy enters your life? With utterly winning stories and a wealth of practical information, &lt;i&gt;The Puppy Diaries &lt;/i&gt;provides an essential road map for navigating the first year of your dog&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
