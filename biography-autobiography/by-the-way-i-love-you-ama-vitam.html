      <meta name="description" content="Within these pages you will find a series of stories, that detail my escape from my past abusive life, and truths that tell of incredible tales of synchronicity.
In addition you will find:
 Insight into my intuition and whispers from my soul. 
 Tales of heartwarming guidance from the Universe (my Higher Power). 
 Stories of my Karmic adventuresliving out my good deeds and bad deeds from previous lives, and trusting the very idea that you reap what you sow. 
 Lessons on the deep discoveries about myself and life, on this place we call Earth.
 Stories of Trust, Letting Go, and surrendering to a Higher Power.
This is the story of a complete transformationthe rebirth of myself as a deeply spiritual person.
My book details the circumstances and events that speak of my journey to the deepest depths of my soula soul that has carried many patterns of behaviours, including parts of me that have been carried forward from lifetime to lifetime. 
In this lifetime, in this existence, I was given the opportunity to extinguish those behavioursput them to rest, conquer and defeat them for evermore.
The purpose of this book is simply to share my journey with you, my beautiful children, and all those who want to change their lives, but just dont know where to start. It is a sharing of my triumphal journey to love and happiness, but most importantly for me, to freedom, the freedom of my soul to live in my Truth. This is what I feel inside my soul every day. I found the courage to take the leap." />
