  <title>One Dog at a Time - Pen Farthing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Kindness flourishes in an Afghan war zone, where British Royal Marine Farthing begins rescuing the starving strays nosing their way onto his compound...Readers will come to know and love each mutt and to admire Farthing, whose caring doesn&#39;t end when his tour does.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The remarkable true story of one man&#39;s fight to save the stray dogs of Afghanistan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the remote outpost of Now Zad, Afghanistan, Pen Farthing and his troop of young Royal Marines survive frequent engagements with the Taliban and forge links with the local community. Appalled by the horrors of local dog fighting, Pen has no choice but to intervene. Then one of the dogs he frees finds his way into the Marine compound--and into Pen&#39;s heart. Soon other strays are drawn into the sanctuary provided by the makeshift pound, including one young mother who crawls under the compound fence carrying her newborn pups to safety. As his tour of duty draws to an end, Pen cannot leave the dogs of Now Zad to their fates. He begins hatching plans to help them escape to a better life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Dog at a Time &lt;/i&gt;is the gripping account of one man&#39;s courage and humanity, and his fight to make a difference in the most hostile and dangerous environments, one dog at a time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
