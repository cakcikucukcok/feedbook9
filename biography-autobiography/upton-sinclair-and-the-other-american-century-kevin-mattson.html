  <title>Upton Sinclair and the Other American Century - Kevin Mattson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for UPTON SINCLAIR and the other American Century&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I look forward to all of Kevin Mattson&#39;s works of history and I&#39;ve notbeen disappointed yet. Upton Sinclair is a thoughtful, well-researched, and extremely eloquently told excavation of the history of theAmerican left and, indeed, the American nation, as well as a testamentto the power of one man to influence his times. Well done.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Eric Alterman, author of When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A splendid read. It reminds you that real heroes once dwelt among us. Mattson not only captures Sinclair&#39;s character, but the world he inhabited, with deft strokes whose energy and passion easily match his subject&#39;s.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Richard Parker, author of John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;From the meat-packing houses of Chicago to the automobile factories of Detroit to the voting booths of California, Upton Sinclair cut a wide swath as a muckraking writer who exposed the injustices rendered by American industrial capitalism. Now Kevin Mattson presents a much-needed exploration of this complex crusader. This is a thoughtful, provocative, and gripping account of an important figure who appeared equal parts intellectual, propagandist, and political combatant as he struggled to illuminate the &#39;other American century&#39; inhabited by the poor and powerless.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--Steven Watts, author of The People&#39;s Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century" />
