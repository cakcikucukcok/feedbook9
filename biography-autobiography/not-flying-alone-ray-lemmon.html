  <title>Not Flying Alone - Ray Lemmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come fly with Captain Ray Lemmon, United Airlines (retired), as he shares the fascinating story of his life and career as an airline pilot and airplane hobbyist. Starting with his Depression-era childhood, Lemmon tells of growing up during World War II, serving in the Army during the Korean Conflict, and finally achieving his dream of becoming an airline pilot with Capital and United Airlines during the emergence of the Jet Age, the mid-century years of growth and turbulence for the airline industry.
Lemmon also writes about owning, restoring and flying vintage airplanes and his adventures with collectible cars, vintage boats, trailers and motor homes. His wife Margaret, his partner in life and adventure, is a prominent part of the story. (She had a pilots license, too.) 
Youll feel as if youre right beside him in the cockpit as he tells stories of cross-country flights in small planes and big onesof the pranks airline pilots playof a terror-filled near-disaster over the Pocono Mountains in Tannersville, Pa.and, after Margarets passing, of a series of surprising events that defy explanation but that lead to unexpected revelation and personal enlightenment. Not Flying Alone is the story of a life and an era, vividly and memorably told." />
