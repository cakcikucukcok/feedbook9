  <title>You Can Stop Humming Now - Daniela Lamas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;For readers of Atul Gawande and Jerome Groopman, a book of  beautifully crafted stories about what life is like for patients kept  alive by modern medical technology.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Modern medicine is a world that glimmers with new technology and cutting-edge research. To the public eye, medical stories often begin with sirens and flashing lights and culminate in survival or death. But these are only the most visible narratives. As a critical care doctor treating people at their sickest, Daniela Lamas is fascinated by a different story: what comes after for those whose lives are extended by days, months, or years as a result of our treatments and technologies? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;You Can Stop Humming Now&lt;/i&gt;, Lamas explores the complex answers to this question through intimate accounts of patients and their families. A grandfather whose failing heart has been replaced by a battery-operated pump; a salesman who found himself a kidney donor on social media; a college student who survived a near fatal overdose and returned home, alive but not the same; and a young woman navigating an adulthood she never thought she&#39;d live to see -- these moving narratives paint a detailed picture of the fragile border between sickness and health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Riveting, gorgeously told, and deeply personal, &lt;i&gt;You Can Stop Humming Now&lt;/i&gt; is a compassionate, uncompromising look at the choices and realities that many of us, and our families, may one day face.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Gripping, soaring, inspiring.&quot;-Atul Gawande, author of &lt;i&gt;Being Mortal&lt;/i&gt;" />
