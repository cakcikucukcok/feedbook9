  <title>Angels with Fur - Melissa Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people collect cars, exquisite paintings, antique furniture, and fragile china sets. While Melissa Wolf appreciates and occasionally enjoys a few of those things, she collects something different: living and breathing beings with four feet, a tailwhich in some cases wagsand an endless capacity for love.
For as long as she can remember, Melissa has always loved animals. In a collection of personal stories, she honors the lives of the animals that have left a mark on her heart over the years. In each tale intricately woven with emotion, she highlights the highs and lows she experienced as she loved, cared for, and attempted to save animals of every kind that included dogs, cats, horses, guinea pigs, hamsters, fish, ducks, chicken, goats, pigs, and even a cow. But as her stories tenderly reveal, Melissa never imagined how each animal, in its own way, would save and forever change her.
Angels with Fur shares a collection of stories that provide a loving tribute to the animals one woman rescued from an uncertain fate and reveal how each ultimately transformed her lifeand her heart." />
