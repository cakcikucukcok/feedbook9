  <title>The Royals and the Roaches - Patricia I. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I belly-crawled across the floor after a bomb exploded outside our garden in Yemen I had tea with Barbara Bush in the Yellow Room of the White House I drove blindly into the midst of an anti-American riot in Venezuela I joined in a folk dance led by Queen Margrethe in Denmark and I ate dinner with a prime minister in Israel.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
Patricia Hughes gives us a candid, tough-minded and fun look at living abroad at the behest of our government. She expresses the frustrations and concerns of a mother and wife while accepting with good humor that the Foreign Service acquires &quot;two for the price of one.&quot; She reminds us of a dedicated group of patriots that are often forgotten-the diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book presents a remarkable range of experience, emotions, people and places that influenced her and her family during 35 years of government service. From terrorism and a civil war to lunch in a palace; from demonstrations and groupies, presidents and princesses to life-long friends-these are &lt;i&gt;The Royals and The Roaches&lt;/i&gt;." />
