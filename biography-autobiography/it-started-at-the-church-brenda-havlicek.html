  <title>It Started at the Church - Brenda Havlicek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ah, love at last! In her search for love, a young girl finally finds what she is looking for, but the things that she went through to find love proved to be almost too costly as her life almost came to an end.
&quot;It Started At The Church&quot; is the story of a young girl who wants to be loved and has fallen prey to an older man, who is seemingly a harmless good Christian brother. She finds herself in love and in trouble in an intriguing relationship of messed up religion, sex, drugs, alcohol and domestic violence at the age of seventeen years old.
The story unfolds and becomes a true bond of insanity across many years of being in a horrifying relationship of so called love, and how she was lost in a world of brokenness, pain, and no self-esteem. It also tells how she finally gained the power to break free, to find purpose, passion and get on the road to inner love, healing and forgiveness." />
