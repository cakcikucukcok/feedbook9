  <title>A Traveler Never Reaches the End of the Road - Nedd Willard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Reader, 
If you want to read fiction, A Traveler Never Reaches the End of the Road is not a book for you. If you like endless travels, youve made a good choice. These are authentic tales about the authors life, stories of adventure, friends and lovers.
He always kept a journal, saving precious moments as he passed through childhood and adolescence. But at the age of 17 he was already a sailor on the SS Rescue as World War Two was coming to an end. He kept sailing on other ships long after that, and the Merchant Marine brought him to Europe where he felt at home, found friends, perfected his French and finished his doctorate. He sketched with pen and ink wherever he went and left hundreds of exquisite works, some of which illustrate his tales.
So open the book and enjoy!
