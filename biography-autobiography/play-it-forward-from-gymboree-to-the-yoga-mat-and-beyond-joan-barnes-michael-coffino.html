  <title>Play It Forward: From Gymboree to the Yoga Mat and Beyond - Joan Barnes, Michael Coffino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Play It Forward&lt;/I&gt; details the remarkable journey of Joan Barnes, the founder and former CEO of Gymboree, and how she learned to align her inner life with outward success.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forty years ago, Joan Barnes founded a modest play center in a church basement with $3,000. Determined to enable women to achieve both personal and entrepreneurial success, Barnes grew Gymboree into an innovative, billion-dollar brand and trailblazing leader in a new industry: activity-based early childhood development.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But this dramatic entrepreneurial memoir is also a cautionary tale and redemption story. When Gymboree&#39;s IPO became a phenomenal success story, Barnes was nowhere near Wall Street. She had stepped down from the company because of an eating disorder that threatened to destroy everything she built.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Barnes was able to confront this disorder, revealing a path to overcome one&amp;#8217;s demons and achieve a sense of worth and hope. She eventually resumed her business career on healthier terms&amp;#151;with a successful line of yoga studios&amp;#151;in an inspiring example of how midcareer women can triumph through reinvention.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Published to coincide with Gymboree&#39;s 40th anniversary, &lt;I&gt;Play It Forward&lt;/I&gt; offers readers a deeply honest perspective of the challenges of building a business and seeking a work-life balance that&amp;#8217;s in tune with personal values.&lt;/div&gt;" />
