  <title>Caught - Janice Singleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All my life, Ive had a love for control. In order to have control, I needed money. It started out from something as simple as an allowance. If it wasnt given to me, I found a way to get it. Hell, I was filling my little Gerber baby food jars with all the coins that I could get my hands on at an early age. The sound of the money clinking against the glass thrilled me. Somehow, I understood that what I had in my hand was power, and I wanted it all the time. I was becoming a master of money before I even mastered multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive always excelled at anything that I made up my mind to do. From grade school through high school, I had no problems academically. I graduated college, had a successful business, and entered into the positive career field of law enforcement. I was extremely blessed, but greed got the best of me while climbing my way to the top of the economic ladder. Then there I was, living it up in Laughlin, Nevada, in a clean brown Armani suit to match my complexion, wearing jewelry that could pay someones mortgage for a year, enjoying the high life in the City of Lights and Chances. Everything was so exciting, every moment so electric, and I was clueless that the ground beneath me was caving in. As I placed another bet, eyes glazed over in anticipation, waiting for the big money hit, I was oblivious to the fact that my quiet, secure, humble home and my business were being surrounded for a raid. How foolish and greedy could I have been to let it get this far? Now there was no way out. &lt;em&gt;I was caught!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;" />
