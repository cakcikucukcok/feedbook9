  <title>Billy Cannon: A Long, Long Run - Charles N. deGravelles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Billy Cannon&#39;s name, his image, and his remarkable athletic career serve as emblems for Louisiana State University, the Southeastern Conference, and college football. LSU&#39;s only Heisman Trophy winner, Cannon led the Tigers to a national championship in 1958, igniting a love of the game in Louisiana and establishing a tradition of greatness at LSU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like many stories of lionized athletes who rise to the status of legend, there was a fall-and in the case of Billy Cannon, also redemption. For the first time, Charles N. deGravelles reveals in full the thrilling highs and unexpected lows of Cannon&#39;s life, in Billy Cannon: A Long, Long Run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through conversations with Cannon, deGravelles follows the athlete-turned-reformer from his boyhood in a working-class Baton Rouge neighborhood to his sudden rush of fame as the leading high school running back in the country. Personal and previously unpublished stories about Cannon&#39;s glory days at LSU and his stellar but controversial career in the pros, as well as details of his indictment for counterfeiting and his post-release work as staff dentist at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, unfold in a riveting biography characterized by uncanny success, deep internal struggles, and a champion&#39;s spirit that pushed through it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
