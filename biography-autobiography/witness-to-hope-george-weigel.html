  <title>Witness to Hope - George Weigel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Fascinating...sheds light on the history of the twentieth century for everyone.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, with an updated preface, the latest edition of the definitive biography of Pope John Paul II that explores how influential he was on the world stage and in some of the most historic events of the twentieth century that can still be felt today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness to Hope&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is the authoritative biography of one of the singular figures&amp;#8212;some might argue the singular figure&amp;#8212;of our time. With unprecedented cooperation from John Paul II and the people who knew and worked with him throughout his life, George Weigel offers a groundbreaking portrait of the Pope as a man, a thinker, and a leader whose religious convictions defined a new approach to world politics&amp;#8212;and changed the course of history. As even his critics concede, John Paul II occupied a unique place on the world stage and put down intellectual markers that no one could ignore or avoid as humanity entered a new millennium fraught with possibility and danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pope was a man of prodigious energy who played a crucial, yet insufficiently explored, role in some of the most momentous events of our time, including the collapse of European communism, the quest for peace in the Middle East, and the democratic transformation of Latin America. With an updated preface, this edition of &lt;em&gt;Witness to Hope&lt;/em&gt; explains how this &amp;#8220;man from a far country&amp;#8221; did all of that, and much more&amp;#8212;and what both his accomplishments and the unfinished business of his pontificate mean for the future of the Church and the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
