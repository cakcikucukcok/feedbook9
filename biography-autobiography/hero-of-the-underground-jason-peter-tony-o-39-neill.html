  <title>Hero of the Underground - Jason Peter, Tony O&#39;Neill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t afraid of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could I be? I lived under death&#39;s shadow every day. When you swallow eighty Vicodin, twenty sleeping pills, drink a bottle of vodka, and still survive, a certain sense of invulnerability stays with you. When you continually use drugs with the kind of reckless determination that I did, the limit to how much heroin or crack you can ingest is not defined in dollar amounts, but in the amounts your body can withstand without experiencing a seizure or respiratory failure. Yet at the end of every binge, every night of lining up six, seven, eight crack pipes and hitting them one after the other &lt;i&gt;bam! bam! bam!&lt;/i&gt; every night of smoking and snorting bag after bag of heroin . . . after all of that, when you still &lt;i&gt;wake up&lt;/i&gt; to see the same dirty sky over you as the night before, you start to think that instead of dying, maybe your punishment is to live---to be stuck in this purgatory of self-abuse and misery for an eternity. Sometimes you start to think that death would come as a blessed relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end, I found myself contemplating death again. Only this time I wasn&#39;t going to leave it to chance. I was going to buy a gun, load the thing, place the barrel in my mouth, and blow my fucking brains out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat on my parents&#39; sofa as I pondered this. All I needed was a gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then all--&lt;br&gt;of my problems--&lt;br&gt;would be solved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
