My Life with a Language Learning Disability&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have written this story of my life with a Language Learning Disability to share with parents, children  &amp; teachers. I hope it will be educational and through the real life stories show how I coped emotionally, physically and personally to get to the successful life I have today as an adult. Seventeen years ago my speech pathologist interviewed my mother about my life at school and my transition into the work force. These interviews gave new insights and ideas to help others and the speech pathologists used them to create more resources for  parents and teachers working and living with people with a language learning disability&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book also gives you a perspective from both my experience and the experience of my parents. .The ups and downs, the important people and the time it has taken me to learn the skills I needed. My story has been the inspiration for the development of educational programs and resources for students with  language learning difficulties. These resources are  collated in One in 11: Practical Strategies for teaching Adolescents with a Language Learning Disabilityand in Working Together: Linking Skills and Curriculum for Adolescents with a Language Learning Disability (both published by ACER press Australia)." />
