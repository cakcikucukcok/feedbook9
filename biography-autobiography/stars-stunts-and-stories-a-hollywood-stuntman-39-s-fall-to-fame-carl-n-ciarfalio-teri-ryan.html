  <title>Stars, Stunts and Stories: A Hollywood Stuntman&#39;s Fall to Fame - Carl N Ciarfalio, Teri Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve known Carl for over thirty years now. He&amp;rsquo;s doubled in me several feature films and TV episodes. Carl is a fantastic person, stuntman and actor as well. Glad he makes me look like a star with his great athletic look, and glad he helps audiences enjoy me in my dangerous action sequences!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lou Ferrigno - Actor, Fitness Consultant, Retired Bodybuilder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough that I can say about Carl Ciarfalio. Fantastic, actor, stuntman, and all around good guy. He has the ability to move even the Toughest Man Alive to tears when I hear his velvety baritone voice crack jokes at my expense. I always know that he is in my corner, and I&amp;rsquo;ll forever be in his.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Judo&amp;quot; Gene LeBell &amp;ndash; Stuntman, Martial Artist, &amp;quot;The Godfather of Grappling&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked with Carl a number of times, and am always impressed at how graceful he was for a man his size. He moves smoothly and effortlessly in complicated fight choreography as if he&amp;#39;s been doing it all his life. Just really impressed the hell outta me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorenzo Lamas &amp;ndash; Actor, Author, Helicopter Pilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Veteran Hollywood stuntman Carl Ciarfalio takes readers inside the celebrity-filled world of blockbuster entertainment with this easy-to-read collection of short stories. Stars, Stunts and Stories: One Man&amp;#39;s Fall to Fame is the memoir of veteran Hollywood stuntman Carl Ciarfalio. Over the last 40 years Carl has worked with major celebrities including Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Woody Harrelson, Mila Kunis, Clint Eastwood, Keifer Sutherland, Jennifer Garner, Carol O&amp;#39;Connor, Lou Ferrigno and Tom Selleck.?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As Carl puts it, &amp;quot;Stuntmen and stuntwomen have the coolest jobs in the industry. We get to fight, fall, burn up, get blown up, kill and get killed. We crash cars, boats, motorcycles and planes, work in tandem with your favorite stars, and take orders from your favorite directors.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Readers will travel behind the scenes, hearing insider anecdotes about mega-stars, gnarly stunts and will receive useful insights and advice about the unique and exciting world of stunts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Carl&amp;rsquo;s life off the set has been just as interesting. He opens up about a teen pregnancy, single fatherhood, surviving a nasty Hollywood divorce and finally finding true love&amp;mdash;plus the time he got run over for real by a criminal driving a half-ton truck!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As compelling as your favorite action movie, &amp;quot;Stars, Stunts, and Stories&amp;quot; will have you turning the pages...and glued to your seat!&lt;/p&gt;" />
