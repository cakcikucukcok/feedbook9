  <title>He&#39;s Got Rhythm - Cynthia Brideson, Sara Brideson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;He sang and danced in the rain, proclaimed New York to be a wonderful town, and convinced a group of Parisian children that they had rhythm. One of the most influential and respected entertainers of Hollywood&#39;s golden age, Gene Kelly revolutionized film musicals with his innovative and timeless choreography. A would-be baseball player and one-time law student, Kelly captured the nation&#39;s imagination in films such as  &lt;I&gt;Anchors Aweigh&lt;/I&gt; (1945),  &lt;I&gt;On the Town&lt;/I&gt; (1949),  &lt;I&gt;An American in Paris&lt;/I&gt; (1951), and &lt;I&gt; Singin&#39; in the Rain&lt;/I&gt; (1952).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the first comprehensive biography written since the legendary star&#39;s death, authors Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson disclose new details of Kelly&#39;s complex life. Not only do they examine his contributions to the world of entertainment in depth, but they also consider his political activities -- including his opposition to the Hollywood blacklist. The authors even confront Kelly&#39;s darker side and explore his notorious competitive streak, his tendency to be a taskmaster on set, and his multiple marriages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing on previously untapped articles and interviews with Kelly&#39;s wives, friends, and colleagues, Brideson and Brideson illuminate new and unexpected aspects of the actor&#39;s life and work.  &lt;I&gt;He&#39;s Got Rhythm&lt;/I&gt; is a balanced and compelling view of one of the screen&#39;s enduring legends.&lt;/P&gt;" />
