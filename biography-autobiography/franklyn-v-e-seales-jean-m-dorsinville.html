  <title>Franklyn V.E. Seales - Jean M Dorsinville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;When I think of my uncle during the few stages of my life until he passed, my earliest memory is of the several paint tubes in his room, the paint easel with various dried paint colors on it and worn brushes.  He would sit in front of his easel, focused, creating, expressing himself in beautiful ways.  I appreciated his ability to focus and lay bare himself in the medium of a painting, in the form of his acting.  He lost himself in that room in front of his piece of unfolding art as well as in his performance roles. I realized that he put forth the same focus and love toward me in so many ways.   
&quot;He was present from the beginning of my life to the end of his. His expression of love came in many forms - calls, letters, gifts, visits.  I even knew that his questions about what I was feeling, thinking and doing were ways of demonstrating his love for me no matter how probing they seemed at the time.  He wanted to make sure that I was happy, smiling and laughing which he always made sure you did with him.   I have now surpassed his age at death and know that his lessons are with me.  He left the example that there are no limits in life, only the ones you self impose. And most importantly, he left me with the ability to know that I should &quot;live the life I love and love the life I live!&quot;  His ashes were taken to St. Vincent in late May 1990.  My trip to St. Vincent for ten days was previously planned and was also purposeful in introducing my cousin Monique to the island.  So, as God would have it, my trip was aligned with Uncle Franklyn&#39;s passing wish to have his ashes sprinkled in the Caribbean sea. It was nice for the family members that were there to be together during that time.&quot;

When we sit back and reflect on significant events, evoke memories of people in our past, assess important aspects of our current lives, and how one man could have played such a transformative role in the journey of so many through life, it is not surprising, in this moment of calm reflection, that we find ourselves inspired to memorialize his remarkable achievements born of a compelling yearning, an insatiable appetite, an incurable drive to live his dreams. Such was a man named Franklyn Vincent Ellison Seales..." />
