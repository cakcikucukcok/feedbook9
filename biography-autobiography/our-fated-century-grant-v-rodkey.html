  <title>Our Fated Century - Grant V. Rodkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Book Summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Fated Century is a kaleidoscopic scan of events and attitudes that have affected us and our fellow earthly travellers during the tumultuous period from 1917 to 2017. During this period, the earth, its people, and their ideas have been ever-changing, and our horizon has shifted from Earth to the universe. The author has had extensive experience in various work and life environments, study, teaching, clinical practice in surgery, medical research, travel, and social interaction. He invites the reader to share in wide-ranging observations and information. In addition, he leaves for his successors cogent suggestions for further study and scientific investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author leaves us with the ancient query -Quo vadis?- But he appends some guideposts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author&amp;#39;s Biography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant Rodkey was born in 1917 in the high plains of Colorado. He finished his undergraduate education as a pre-med major from 1936 to 1939 at Whitworth College in Spokane, Washington, and was then accepted into Harvard Medical School, where he eventually chose surgery as his specialty. He was conscripted into the military and served in the Army Reserve from 1942 to 1945. In 1945, he was called to active duty and was shipped to China. He held a variety of jobs leading up to being a surgeon. He has taught at Tufts, Harvard and Boston University. He has established two scholarships in his name. He was the Massachusetts delegate for the American Medical Association, and is still involved in the Massachusetts Medical Society. He has had extensive experience in various work environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
