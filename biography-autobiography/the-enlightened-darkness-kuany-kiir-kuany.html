  <title>THE ENLIGHTENED DARKNESS - Kuany Kiir Kuany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;FOREWORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to have read the book The Enlightened Darkness by one of my finest students, Simon.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The story of Joseph is that of a boy who dwells in hell with the composure of a priest while fighting tough life battles every single day. All the while he is trying to make sense of his past, his country and his world. It is a world of struggle, of keeping alive against all the odds.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This book will challenge the view of life held by the youth of today. It will show&lt;br /&gt;
them what living means, and how to appreciate even the emptiness&lt;br /&gt;
and nothingness of life. It will teach them to be broad thinking and to be global&lt;br /&gt;
citizens. To view the problems of the world as theirs. It will teach them to be inquisitive. To think on their own and to question every convention. Even the most sacred foundations of our human structure.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It will inspire young people to seek mental freedom, spiritual/inner peace and the&lt;br /&gt;
freedom to think and act like a human being. To be &amp;lsquo;the God-essence person.&amp;rsquo; For good people is what the world needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
You do not need to be[&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
