Children in that era were safe to walk city streets and explore parks and wooded areas. Racial prejudice was rampant, and most families had stay-at-home mothers. The South Shore Railroad was in its heyday and Washington Park was a popular recreation area. With a healthy dose of humor tempered with a pinch of pathos and a sprinkling of irony, Grace Street touches on old-world beliefs and customs while telling the story of siblings and cousins who grew up in a sometimes confusing ethnic environment. This close-knit family had a few secrets, including an alcoholic uncle and a grandmother who was nearly deported, but the parents rarely spoke of these matters, especially to the children.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
