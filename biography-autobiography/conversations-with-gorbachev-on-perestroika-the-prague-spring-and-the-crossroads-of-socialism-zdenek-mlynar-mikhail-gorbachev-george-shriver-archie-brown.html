  <title>Conversations with Gorbachev: On Perestroika, the Prague Spring, and the Crossroads of Socialism - Zdenek Mlynar, Mikhail Gorbachev, George Shriver, Archie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev and Zdenek Mlynar were friends for half a century, since they first crossed paths as students in 1950. Although one was a Russian and the other a Czech, they were both ardent supporters of communism and socialism. One took part in laying the groundwork for and carrying out the Prague spring; the other opened a new political era in Soviet world politics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In 1993 they decided that their conversations might be of interest to others and so they began to tape-record them. This book is the product of that &amp;#147;thinking out loud&amp;#8221; process. It is an absorbing record of two friends trying to explain to one another their views on the problems and events that determined their destinies. From reminiscences of their starry-eyed university days to reflections on the use of force to &amp;#147;save socialism&amp;#8221; to contemplation of the end of the cold war, here is a far more candid picture of Gorbachev than we have ever seen before.&lt;/div&gt;" />
