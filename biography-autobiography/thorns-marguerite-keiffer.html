  <title>Thorns - Marguerite Keiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about Marguerite, an accomplished pianist who lost her ability to play the piano after suffering a paralytic stroke that almost took her life. She was devastated and deeply concerned about her three young children and their care, especially after she found that her condition was permanent. When she consulted her former piano teacher, he suggested she return to teaching piano to children, using only one hand. For the next twenty-five years, her life was full of joy until thorns flooded her life with many orthopedic surgeries needed that eventually left her wheelchair bound, unable to stand or walk at all. Pain, depression, and hopelessness took over; this time, she called out to her Savior, Jesus, to help her. Her faith took deep roots and her life took on a whole new meaning. With God&#39;s help, she received the strength to live a victorious life!" />
