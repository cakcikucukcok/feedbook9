  <title>From the Prize Ring to the Pulpit - Carolyn Rhame Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book takes the reader through the story of a man who left the glamour of a boxing career and professional entertaining to follow a faith so deep you will be inspired to examine your own faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rhame was a professional fighter and entertainer, but to me he will always be my pastor.  As a young boy growing up in the church, his love for God and for people was a great example and influence in my life and future ministry.  In reading this book, you will learn about what the heart of a pastor truly looks like, as that is what John Rhame was all about. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Newell Smith, District Superintendent, Philadelphia District Church of the Nazarene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Rev. Rhame only a few times as young Christian, but his love for God was always evident and impactful. His musical talent and the story of his life were rich and colorful and left a lasting impression on all who experienced it. His greatest contribution in my life came through the influence of his daughter Carolyn, the author of this book, who shared his legacy of love with me and many other young people that she served in our youth group.&lt;/p&gt;   
    &lt;p&gt; M. Kim Smith, District Superintendent, Iowa District Church of the Nazarene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we long for a hero to follow--someone who is bigger than life; But the real gift is when that hero humbly points us to Someone beyond ourselves; Someone who created us for greater purpose and meaning in life.  This book reveals the story of what God can do in and through and with the life of a man who is fully surrendered to Him.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Allan Greer, Senior Pastor, Parkway Place Baptist Church, Little Rock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all stories have an end but every story has a beginning. This is a story of one mans beginning and decision which made an everlasting impact on generations.&lt;/p&gt;
