  <title>Korea&#39;s Syngman Rhee: An Unauthorized Portrait - Richard C. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This book of Korean history is an unofficial and exceptionally honest biography of South Korea&#39;s deposed chief executive, Syngman Rhee.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rhee&#39;s career spanned the decades between the late-nineteenth-century period of China&#39;s suzerainty in Korea and the revolt of April 1960 and reached a peak of popularity following his country&#39;s liberation at the end of World War II.  Yet, twelve years later he was thrown out of office by revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During his lifetime, he has become almost a legend in both East and West and, in much of the world, is considered the virtual embodiment of the Korean struggle for independence. &quot;The story of South Korea,&quot; the author further observes, &quot;is indeed the story of its erstwhile president, even as the fall of his government can be traced directly to the personal shortcomings of the head of state.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A fascinating read for Korean Americans or anyone interested in Korean history and culture, this work is an excellent addition to any collection of political biographies.&lt;/div&gt;" />
