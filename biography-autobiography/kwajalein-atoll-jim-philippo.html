  <title>Kwajalein Atoll - Jim Philippo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Long before the advent of what became known as The Project, Iroijlaplap Imata Jabro Kabua and I discussed this matter and got our minds together to work the details to this writing. It is indeed a great honor and privilege to have worked alongside a man whom I have not only come to admire and respect but also consider as my Iroijlaplap (paramount king) and a man of the people who deserves to be called a king unto his people.
Throughout all my interactions and travels with Iroijlaplap Jabro, I have seen this man as one who affects the outcome of destiny through his interaction with many of his people or with just about anyone. He could be reserved if he chooses to be, and he could be so direct in his conversation that at certain times, one could see the blush on his or her face. In his dealing with people, he could be your best friend and your worst enemy. Iroijlaplap Jabro likes telling it this way, I dont write things down, but I keep everything up here, pointing his fingers at his head. Intelligent and witty in his own ways and sharp as a razor blade, in dealing with him you know you are in the presence of a man who has had his walks around the block and walks the walk and talks the talk. Most of all, he is fair in his dealings with people. He is the kindly king, who goes out of his way to those who are in need of his services. He has been known to say, I am only good as a servant to my people." />
