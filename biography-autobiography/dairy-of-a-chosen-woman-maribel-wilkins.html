  <title>Dairy of a &quot;Chosen&quot; Woman - Maribel Wilkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel is not so much a diary of edited events and my personal opinions as it is a food for thought novel about life experienced and seen from different perspectives. From the spiritual to the physical in terms of experiences. From the religious to the secular in terms of mindset as it relates to and affect mankind.     It also touches the issue of race. The human race as a whole and the modern version of the battle between the races, as well as the battle for the minds of man. It is an interconnected battle that is more about supremacy then it is of equality. A battle not so much about the color of the skin but the spirit that resides within." />
