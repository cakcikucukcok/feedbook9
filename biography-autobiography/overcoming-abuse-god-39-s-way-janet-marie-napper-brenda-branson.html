&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Janet Marie Napper offers the reader a compelling and heartrending account of a life--her life--impacted by abuse and the long, difficult, and painful journey toward hope and healing in its aftermath. Written for a general audience, the book calls us to see the despair, the denial, the desire to escape, and the eventual determination that is required to change the stranglehold of the past and to chart a new direction. Survivors and those who walk alongside them will find her story a powerful lens through which to see the cruelty of childhood abuse as well as its long term consequences.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Nancy Nason-Clark, professor at the University of New Brunswick, Canada; author of numerous books and articles, including Beyond Abuse in the Christian Home and Refuge from Abuse: Healing and Hope for Abused Christian Women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I would like other teenagers to read it. It shows us how not to make wrong decisions in boys so we don&#39;t make mistakes and get hurt. This book shows you what to look for and not get tricked into being abused by boys and men...&lt;br /&gt;
