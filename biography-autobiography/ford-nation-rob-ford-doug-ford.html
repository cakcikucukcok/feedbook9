  <title>Ford Nation - Rob Ford, Doug Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During his tumultuous term as mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford always stayed on message&amp;#8212;saving taxpayers money and putting the brakes on the &amp;#8220;gravy train&amp;#8221; at city hall. He also returned every phone call, even showing up on people&amp;#8217;s doorsteps late at night to help them with their problems. But despite his hard work to cut excessive spending and to address the city&amp;#8217;s crumbling infrastructure, the media delighted in showcasing Ford&amp;#8217;s most personal struggles instead. Reporters followed him to his car, onto his front lawn, and trailed behind while he trick-or-treated with his children. The city, the country, the entire world watched Rob Ford battle substance abuse, but they rarely saw or heard the real story behind Ford&amp;#8212;the family man, the faithful public servant, the devoted husband, father, and brother who put the people of his city above all else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ford Nation&lt;/em&gt;, Doug Ford, Rob&amp;#8217;s brother and most trusted advisor, shares the true story of the two brothers and the Ford family: from the early days of their parents&amp;#8217; marriage, as Diane and Doug Sr worked tirelessly to get their company, Deco Labels and Tags, off the ground; to the Etobicoke house filled with the Ford children; to Doug Sr&amp;#8217;s entry into provincial politics, with Rob and Doug following in his footsteps, to city hall. &lt;em&gt;Ford Nation&lt;/em&gt; recounts the triumphs and strug-gles of Rob and Doug in their own voices&amp;#8212;as well as the voices of their mother, Diane, nephew Michael, Rob&amp;#8217;s widow, Renata, and daughter, Stephanie&amp;#8212;from knocking on doors as new candidates to knocking out opponents in council chamber debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rob was forced to end his campaign to remain mayor of Toronto, Doug didn&amp;#8217;t hesitate to jump into the race, and despite his very late start he almost pulled off an upset. Doug shares what life was like for the family during this difficult time, and what it was like in the final hour of Rob&amp;#8217;s life, when he succumbed to cancer and became, in his daughter Stephanie&amp;#8217;s words, &amp;#8220;the mayor of heaven.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a number of sources to share Rob&amp;#8217;s life in his own words after he became too ill to continue working on the book, &lt;em&gt;Ford Nation&lt;/em&gt; is the only book that accurately captures the entire account of Rob and Doug Ford and their fight to protect the rights of the little guy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
