  <title>Rocky Ground: An Ozark Family Holds On Through Hard Times - Margaret DuBois</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The economy didn&#39;t go through the Great Depression - people did. Margaret DuBois grew up in a period of historic deprivation. Her family had to retreat to her grandparents&#39; Ozark farm to survive. The farm patriarch, her grandfather, was a revival-meeting minister who had once served as a State Legislator.  Their home-life differed from most similarly-situated Ozark families in its focus on spiritual duties and the love of learning. Books lined their shelves. Political bombast and pious sermon occupied their dinners. They didn&#39;t get up pre-dawn as most farm families did.  Hard times drew out the best and worst of human character.  As she watched her family cope with all manner of human failing, and unremitting rotten luck, Margaret saw that people are complex and rife with contradictions. In her family&#39;s composure through bitter disappointments she saw a strength of character worthy of remembrance. And on that rocky ground where the DuBois family held fast, she hatched her dreams." />
