  <title>Diamond in the Rough: A Memoir - Shawn Colvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After learning to play guitar at the age of ten, Shawn Colvin was determined to make a life in music&amp;#8212;a decision that would send a small-town girl out on the open road for good. In 1997, two decades after she started, she got her big break. Like the troubled would-be arsonist and survivor of her smash hit &quot;Sunny Came Home,&quot; Colvin knows a thing or two about heartache&amp;#8212;and setting fires. &lt;em&gt;Diamond in the Rough&lt;/em&gt; recounts this passionate musician&#39;s coming-of-age, from&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;prairies of South Dakota to the dark smoky bars in Austin, Texas, to the world stage at the Grammys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humorous and deeply honest, Colvin relates the experiences behind her best-loved songs in vivid color in this memoir. &lt;em&gt;Diamond in the Rough&lt;/em&gt; captures her years of touring cross-country in bands and vans full of guys; falling in and out of love; meeting heroes like Joni Mitchell; searching for her musical identity; and making friendships that would last a lifetime. It is also an unflinching account of Colvin&#39;s struggles&amp;#8212;weathering addiction and depression, learning to care for not only herself but also a child&amp;#8212;and, always, channeling those experiences into song. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the wit, lyricism, and empathy that have characterized Colvin&#39;s performances and inspired audiences worldwide, &lt;em&gt;Diamond in the Rough&lt;/em&gt; looks back over a rich lifetime of highs and lows with stunning insight and candor. In its pages, we witness the inspiring story of a woman honing her artistry, finding her voice, and making herself whole. &lt;/p&gt;" />
