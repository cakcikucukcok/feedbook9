  <title>Pilot with a Purpose - Harold Eugene Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For many, Harold Thomas is best known for his practical wisdom
in business; founding and building Idahos TrusJoist Corporation, whose
success spanned just over four decades. Others would point to his legacy
of philanthropy. Still others might cite his key role in the Quest Aircraft
Company and development of the unique Kodiak for international
humanitarian applications. Insiders might emphasize his love of family
and others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Harold wondered why he didnt know more about his own
family history. It was a little perplexing. He has wanted to share more
of his adventure so that his friends and family didnt experience the same
loss. His life has been a fascinating journey through the business world,
the worlds of aviation, missions and philanthropy; and the story is
finally told here. This isnt simply a story of success and philanthropy,
but a story to encourage family and friends to trust God and give
themselves to His adventure for their lives! -Editor" />
