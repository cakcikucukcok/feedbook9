  <title>To Climb the Mountain - Irwin H. Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bravo. There are many people writing, but you are truly an artist!!! Very much enjoyed the story, the style and the artistic expression. Havent seen this kind of writing in our circles. Thanks. S.S. (London, England)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see your name, Im there. It is the first article I read in the Hamodia. The depth, style and writing truly mesmerizes me. A.B. (Bnei Brak, Israel)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a note to let you now how much I have been enjoying your articles in the Hamodia. They are humorous, thought provoking and always leave me with some mussar haskel. It is a pleasure to read articles with such depth and toichen. E.F. (Monsey)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, Im a huge fan of your stories. Its the first thing I check out when I buy the Hamodia. You are a huge inspiration to me, both in Judaism and in your outlook on life. I love the nostalgia and your prolific writing. Im a Chasidic boy. Yiddishkait has a huge influence on me. I would like to know if there is any other place where I could enjoy your writings. S.M. (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words cannot express the great appreciation I have for the beautiful story you wrote in Hamodia. Being married to a Ben Torah for ten years, the story really gave me a new rejuvenated feeling, how many of us take it for granted and do not realize the true value of Torah learning. I dont know how I can thank you enough. R.B. (Lakewood, NJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to your articles in the Hamodia. I wish that they would appear more often. In addition to the good subjects, I love your writing. The stories are impossible to put down once begun. S.T. (New York)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are avid readers of your articles. We find them captivating, witty and extremely well written. M.A. (Brooklyn, NY)&lt;/p&gt;" />
