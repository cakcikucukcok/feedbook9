  <title>OHIXIHO - Winston C Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book represents the fulfilment of a request made by my dad&amp;rsquo;s first cousin, Charlie Fraser, in May 1973, when, at the age of 92, he gave me a somewhat weathered brown envelope stuffed with documents to be used in writing his official biography &amp;quot;later.&amp;quot; It is unclear what he meant by &amp;quot;later,&amp;quot; but now, after more than 40 years, his request is finally being honoured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had he been born a few generations later, Charlie might have become another Steve Jobs (co-founder of Apple Computer) or Usain Bolt (world champion sprinter). Born in 1881 in the small town of Cookshire in Quebec&amp;rsquo;s Eastern Townships, Charles Clark Fraser was a man who was, in many respects, miles ahead of his time. In spite of significant disabilities, this remarkable man&amp;rsquo;s long life was punctuated by many unique accomplishments in a wide variety of fields. Rarely has a single individual practiced so many vocations over a lifetime. To borrow a line from the 18th century nursery rhyme &amp;quot;Rub-a-dub-dub,&amp;quot; he was neither &amp;quot;a butcher, a baker nor candlestick maker,&amp;quot; but he was almost everything else. Charlie was a gold prospector, an inventor, a woodsman, an athlete, a mathematician, a chemist, a fox rancher, a numismatist, a philatelist, a photographer, a museum curator, an astronomer, an animal trainer, a dentist, a philanthropist and a jack of all trades. Although a lifelong bachelor, he was, strangely enough, very much a family man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While known to most people simply as &amp;quot;Charlie,&amp;quot; he used different monikers when referring to himself. In correspondence and legal documents he signed his name as &amp;quot;C.C. Fraser.&amp;quot; In less formal notes he used only his initials, &amp;quot;CCF.&amp;quot; Very often his signature was accompanied by the word &amp;quot;OHIXIHO&amp;quot; as though it was his address or even a part of his name. The real meaning of OHIXIHO is left for the reader to discover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
