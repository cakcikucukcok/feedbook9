  <title>What Love Is - Yonda Morrison Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What Love Is&quot; is a book that was written about and for people that I work with. It is a book about how they feel about the loves, family, friends, and pets in and out of their lives. I wrote this book by asking people if they wanted to be in the book, and whom or whatdid they want me to write about. It was a wonderful experience for me to put in words what they were feeling about the special people that they share their lives with everyday. I am glad that I could also share in someway the joys and happiness that they give to the people and pets who mean so much to them. It was truly an honor for me to share this time with them. And I am hoping that there is a message in &quot;What Love Is&quot; for someone else too." />
