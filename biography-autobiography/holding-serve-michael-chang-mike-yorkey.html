  <title>Holding Serve - Michael Chang, Mike Yorkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Often characterized as David facing Goliath on the tennis court, at 5&#39;9&quot; and 150 pounds Michael Chang is used to playing with the big hitters. What he lacks in stature, he makes up for in determination. A serious contender at any Grand Slam event, his bold statement of faith in God makes him a role model we can all look up to. &quot;What&#39;s nice,&quot; Michael says, &quot;is that, as long as my priorities are straight, I&#39;m able to go out with the mentality to really leave the winning and losing up to the Lord.&quot; In Holding Serve readers get a unique glimpse at Team Chang, Michael&#39;s powerful family unit that he credits with much of his success. Michael also shares the story of how he became a Christian and the central role his faith has played in his achievements." />
