  <title>The Sum of All Things: Connecting With the Spirit and God In Us All - Derek L. Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever had a moment that redefined everything you thought to be true about life, family, and faith?   Derek L. Gray had such a moment in the fall of 2014, when he suffered a series of personal and professional setbacks that left him seeking answers to life&#39;s biggest questions. He was greeted by God and a host of spiritual guides more than happy to provide answers.   In this book, he acts as a messenger of God, sharing what he learned over the course of two years. During that time, he spoke with angels, witnessed life hours after his birth, observed life before he was born, and crossed the veil to speak to his dad again.   These amazing experiences-along with working side by side with his spiritual mother, Liese, and his spiritual guide, Harman, shape the life-changing messages in this book.   If you&#39;ve always been convinced that we can learn nothing more about God than what is written in the Bible, then open your mind to new ideas." />
