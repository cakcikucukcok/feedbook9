  <title>I Bend Down for Pennies and I Bend Down to Pray in a Broken Church - Rev. Anthony C. Catalano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a second generation, oldest son of an immigrant Sicilian family. I became a Roman Catholic priest. I left the priesthood and married. I raised a family and now I have returned to the priesthood again with the Independent Catholic Movement. 
When I wrote this book, I wanted to be honest. I sought neither to enhance my self-portrayal nor diminish it. For me that meant I had to reveal how I honestly thought, felt, and acted at specific times in my life. I had no idea how much appreciation and pain I would experience from reviewing my life like this. It was not easy." />
