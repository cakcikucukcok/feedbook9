  <title>God Didn’T Have to Make the Crickets Sing - Gail Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered about those cricketsyou know, the little black insects that rub something together to make chirping sounds when it seems extra hot and sticky? I never did. Oh, sure, I heard their chirps in the evenings when I was trying to go to sleep, and I knew that it was part of the natural world. But there was no meaning beyond thatnot until a wondrous moment when God used their melody to catch my attention. Even though I became a Christian at fourteen and loved the Lord Jesus Christ, I was heavily and passionately pursuing the American Dream with my husbanduntil it began self-destructing job by job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when dream after dream in your life is destroyedwhen there seems to be no stability or sanity? You fall apart, or at least I did. Time after time, my light turned to darkness and my hope was shattered. That was the point at which God wrote His beautiful melody and opened my heart so that I could hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a beautiful, but extremely painful way, God used this destruction to introduce me to a deeper, intimate relationship with Him when I heard the songHis song. Hopefully, you will hear it too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
