  <title>The Search to Forgive - Pam Edison Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a book is used by God to be a part of your rescue, you never forget it or the author. This happened after losing a parent to suicide. I bought No Mountain Too High and read it fully without putting it down. God used three authors during that time in addition to His WordDr. David Jeremiah, Dr. Ike Reighard, and Pam Mann!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pam told her story and because she made it to the other side of grief upon grief, I knew that I could too. Having the privilege of then getting to know her personally, I can say that her writing is genuine and authentic to who she is and that she is a living testimonynot just a written one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am beyond excited to continue reading with the release of this new book. I am a life that was changed. ~Leigh~&lt;/p&gt;" />
