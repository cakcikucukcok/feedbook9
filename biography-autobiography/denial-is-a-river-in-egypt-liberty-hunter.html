  <title>Denial Is A River In Egypt - Liberty Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WHAT is normal? Is it represented by a boring, mundane, grinding routine? An existence many of us take for granted and curse at times for being so predictable? Perhaps. But one day, it is suddenly gone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young mum Indy had a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; life. Through a series of events triggered by the bizarre behaviours of her five-year-old daughter, Indy struggles to comprehend what has happened. She has questions, but nobody seems able to answer them. Struggling to comprehend this detour her life has taken, her journey turns inwards. She questions herself. What destroyed her vision of success is deeply embedded in her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitter with deep resentment, Indy&amp;rsquo;s anger consumes her. Her downward spiral is interrupted by tragic circumstances that numb her and neutralise her self-absorption. She uncovers truths that bring a change to her perspective. The implications of adversity have a profound impact on her outlook. The techniques described and discovered by Indy inspire her through her darkest days. Dark though it seems to be, light from unexpected places inspires a shift in Indy&amp;rsquo;s focus and brings lessons about tolerance, love, and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many families face the challenges depicted in this book. How they cope and reconcile the adjustments necessary to accept change is a personal matter. Each person&amp;rsquo;s journey will be unique. Denial Is a River in Egypt shares Indy&amp;rsquo;s. It is a real story about an average family and their average life. There are many who endure more than their share of the extremes of challenge and despair in life, and some stumble in defeat. During those lows, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to remember what makes your heart sing, but surprising discoveries can arise from the ashes of broken dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is a personal journey. Only you will be able to find and follow what&amp;rsquo;s right for you. Being open to growth can restore broken hearts. New dreams will evolve. Hearts that dare to dream soar high once again with new hope and renewed freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear not. Your future awaits you! Stop chasing your dreams. Catch them and make them a reality! Allow your river of inspiration to carry you towards what brings colour into your world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As most new parents know, exhaustion is a constant companion, but joy is usually not far behind. Yet there is little of the latter as author Liberty Hunter shares the experience of a young mother, Indy Fielding, dealing with her autistic daughter Cassie, two younger children, and overwhelming feelings of self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the novel is couched as Indy&amp;rsquo;s story, it seems as if this is about Hunter, who is also raising an autistic child, according to her author bio. Hunter makes little effort to separate her own experiences from those of Indy&amp;rsquo;s, weighing down Indy&amp;rsquo;s experiences with tedious medical explanations and incorporating numerous grainy photos, charts, and lists into her storyline. The latter only serve as distractions and do little to enlighten or engage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
