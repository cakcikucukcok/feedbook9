  <title>Chasing American Dreams - Mahmudul Alam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is enormous, entire 197 million square miles of it. However, it pales into insignificance when compared to the scale and complexity of the human brain, the human mind.
The mind lives in the unlimited space of imagination and can move mountains, cause the skies to fall and earth to spin. What separates the mind is mans belief in separation but everything is from the same source and therefore, we are all connected. Individually, we all have our own roles to play that collectively keeps this planet spinning on its current axis.
My mind, my imagination and my ideas are presented to you in the form of this book. My purpose is to share with you my aspirations and me ever present belief in the collective power of humanity.
Fear strikes with a shaking hand
But imaginations imagination is alive and ever present
Blessing to us from Robert Frost and Edgar Allen
Amongst many more
The desire to write has taken place
Writing a poem to humble me
My shaking hand but
I will not give up
I will dedicate this
These words are meant to be
A sharing of my respect and gratitude
To all writers and poets
Who will not give up?
Mahmudul Alam" />
