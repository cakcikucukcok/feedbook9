  <title>My New American Dream - Gatluak Ter Thach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book divulges personal stories and perspectives that I believe will enlighten people about me, why I came to America, and what I consider to be the best way for new American citizens to recognize their New American Dreams. 
In several conversations with friends and colleagues, they thought it would be good for me to write a book to tell the world about my life. They include: Angela Harris of the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, Donna Kumar of InfoWorks, Kathy Edson of Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and NICEs board chair, Anam Gnaho and Tseday Girma of Ethiopia Community Development Council, Inc., Sarah Russ of Nashville International Center for Empowerment, Cayce Pack of United Children Funds, my family and many others. Their encouragement made it possible for me to share my story and personal views of the world. Thank you all for your encouragement and support of this project.
Also, I dont want this book to be limited to academia, and thats why I name the authors of the works I&#39;ve quoted and used for research but do not include publication dates for those works in the text. My research included reviews of literature in several disciplines, especially leadership, management, and psychology, as I thought these would support the books educational purposes. 
The first part of this book tells the history of my journey in life. The second part contains essays about a new mission for those coming to America and how to carry out this new mission. The final part offers my recommendations for realizing the New American Dream for all people, whether they live in America or not." />
