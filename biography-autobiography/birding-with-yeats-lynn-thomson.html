  <title>Birding with Yeats - Lynn Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A delicately rendered memoir on motherhood, family, and the beauty of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fall 2007, Lynn Thomson experiences a huge life shift. Her teenage son, Yeats, is just beginning high school. Yeats has always struggled against the system, against the pressure to conform. He is a poet at heart: acutely sensitive, highly intelligent, and solitary by nature. Lynn and Yeats have always been close, but after fourteen years as a stay-at-home mom Lynn is going back to work for her husband, Ben, who has just opened his own bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lynn and Yeats take a trip to Vancouver Island, they discover a mutual love of bird watching. Lynn is the only other person Yeats has found who loves nature and watching birds. Plus, she has a car. Lynn describes in wondrous detail the many trips she and Yeats take, from the Wye Marsh and Pelee Island in Ontario, to Vancouver Island in British Columbia, to an ill-fated trip to the Galapagos Islands. The two grow closer with each bird-watching expedition. At the same time, Lynn notices that her son is beginning to pull away &amp;#8212; and she must learn to let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birding with Yeats&lt;/em&gt; is a delicate, sensitive, and gentle reflection on the unique bond between a mother and son, and the magic that is the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
