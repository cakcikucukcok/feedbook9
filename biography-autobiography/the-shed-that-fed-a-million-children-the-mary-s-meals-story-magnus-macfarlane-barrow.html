  <title>The Shed That Fed a Million Children: The Mary’s Meals Story - Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Speaking Volumes Christian Book of the Year 2016&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mary’s Meals is born from acts of love. If you put all those many acts of sacrifice together it creates a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mary’s Meals tells the inspirational and compelling story of how a cripplingly shy Salmon farmer from Argyll, Scotland, became the international CEO of a global charity that now feeds over 800,000 children a day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 1992, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow was enjoying a pint with his brother when he got an idea that would change his life – and radically change the lives of others. After watching a news bulletin about war-torn Bosnia, the two brothers agreed to take a week’s hiatus from work to help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What neither of them expected is that what began as a one-time road trip in a beaten-up Landrover rapidly grew to become Magnus’s life’s work – leading him to leave his job, sell his house and direct all his efforts to feeding thousands of the world’s poorest children.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Magnus retells how a series of miraculous circumstances and an overwhelming display of love from those around him led to the creation of Mary’s Meals; an organisation that could hold the key to eradicating child hunger altogether. This humble, heart-warming yet powerful story has never been more relevant in our society of plenty and privilege. It will open your eyes to the extraordinary impact that one person can make.&lt;/p&gt;
