  <title>The After Path - Rochelle D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The nights were filled with chaos and the days with sadness. It appeared, as if there was no hope or care. Every rising of the sun brought forth dis spare. our hearts would be filled with grief and pain remembering the wind and the rain. Now, the storm has past yet our home is fading fast. There is no-one to aide us in time of need. Tell me who will help us , help us if they please? A heart that stands still and one that grieves. The children are lost and elderly have all faded yet, others are still wondering how the storm was rated. A 5 or 3 is no longer the concern ,but how will they eat and where will they live. Where will we wander and how shall we live. Unwanted, rejected and not cared for how can we calm our fears. How shall we survive how will we cope, a people cast abroad one with no hope." />
