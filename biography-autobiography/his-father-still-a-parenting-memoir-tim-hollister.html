  <title>His Father Still: A Parenting Memoir - Tim Hollister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Reid Hollister was a rambunctious, handsome, and sometimes rebellious teenager.  While he delighted many friends with humor and antics, he struggled as a student, regularly tested his parents&amp;#8217; patience, and chafed at efforts to guide and discipline him.  As he began his senior year in a private high school, Reid suddenly found himself accused of misconduct, which he vehemently denied.  Several days later, driving on a highway, Reid died in a one-car crash.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;His Father Still&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;I&gt; A Parenting Memoir&lt;/I&gt; is, first, Reid&amp;#8217;s father&amp;#8217;s disarmingly candid account of the tumult of parenting Reid through his teenage years, and then confronting the unthinkable obligations of a father to a son after a sudden tragedy.  But this book is about much more than parenting and grief.  In the months following Reid&amp;#8217;s crash, as Tim Hollister worked to steady himself and his family, he found himself consumed by an accelerated need to answer two questions:  Had he been a good father?  And in raising his son, had he struck the right balance between exposing him to life&amp;#8217;s risks while protecting him from life&amp;#8217;s dangers?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answers came in large part from a flood of condolences conveyed through letters and emails, and also in social media posts -- which at the time, 2006, were a brand-new phenomenon.  From these messages emerged a mosaic of Reid&amp;#8217;s character and personality that was barely known to Tim while Reid was alive because, as parents raise teens by &amp;#147;letting out the tether,&amp;#8221;  they see less of and know less about their kids.  Thus, after Reid&amp;#8217;s passing, Tim learned more about his son than he had known while Reid was alive.  While this portrait arrived too late, it was not unwelcome;  Reid&amp;#8217;s crash and its aftermath eventually segued to Tim forging these new insights into the foundation of a renewed relationship with his son that was, if nothing else, a sustainable way forward.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is, therefore, remarkable not only for its honesty but also for its forays into a breadth of universal issues, topics that shaped both Tim &amp;#145;s experience as a father while Reid was alive and his reconstruction of their parent-child  bond after the crash:  balancing protection and freedom when raising a teen; delivering discipline; reacting to a school&amp;#8217;s contested accusation of misconduct; supervising a teen driver; writing an obituary and eulogy for a teen; composing condolence messages, especially through social media;  preserving and then giving away a deceased&amp;#8217;s possessions; using the aftermath of tragedy to rebuild a frayed relationship; counting blessings; establishing an enduring connection with a loved one who has passed away;  and harnessing the power of  communities to care for those reeling from a sudden loss.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tim Hollister is an environmental attorney who has been ranked among the &lt;I&gt;Best Lawyers in America&lt;/I&gt;. After Reid&amp;#8217;s crash in 2006, Tim became an advocate for safer teen driving.  In 2009, he launched a national blog for parents of teen drivers, &amp;#147;From Reid&amp;#8217;s Dad,&amp;#8221; www.fromreidsdad.org, and in 2013 he published &lt;B&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/B&gt;: Parenting Your Teen Through the Dangers of Driving (Chicago Review Press), www.nsfteendriving.com.  In 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation honored Tim&amp;#8217;s advocacy with the nation&amp;#8217;s highest civilian award for traffic safety, and in 2014, the Governors Highway Safety Association recognized &lt;B&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/B&gt; with its own national public service award.  Tim has appeared on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, the &amp;#147;Home and Family Show&amp;#8221; on the Hallmark Channel, and Kyra Phillips&amp;#8217; Raising America on HLN. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and daughter.&lt;/div&gt;" />
