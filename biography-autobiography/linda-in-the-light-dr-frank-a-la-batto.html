  <title>Linda in the Light - Dr. Frank A. La Batto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Frank A. La Batto presents Linda in The Light, a true story, a memoir, written by a father honoring the request of his daughter after she transitions into the light of eternal life; a transition we will all experience. What lies ahead is a glorious and true journey of angels, healers, and guides. Everything is real. Everything is normal. Any fear of death will be erased for we are the lucky ones. We have been given the opportunity to examine our lives, to change our courses, to alter our destinies, because our children, our teachers, via their transitions, have courageously fulfilled the promises they made before they were born, allowing us to learn, grow, and love. We cannot let them down. Our children, by their transformations, lift the mask between the physical and non-physical, allowing us to experience eternity as an undeniable, normal, natural, essential birthright. It is through this book that Dr. La Batto introduces Linda&amp;rsquo;s earthly sojourn, his earthly sojourn, and the ensuing intertwining of their journeys simultaneously in the physical and non-physical bound by pure unconditional love. Dr. La Batto takes you through a simplified, easily navigated knowing, an essential birthright available to all, by relating his life experiences, Linda&amp;rsquo;s life experiences in both the physical and non-physical, books he has read, people he has met; expounding in unequivocal, common, daily, reproducible encounters, the uninterruption of existence, the verifiability of immortality, and the fact there is no separation, just a shift from one embodiment to the next. There is no special formula or unique path, no near-death or profound religious experience necessary in order to lift the veil between the physical and non-physical and reconnect with our children and loved ones. This true story, this road, this journey of Dr. La Batto and his daughter Linda, is one of an infinite number of journeys, something he expresses many times throughout the book. Linda in The Light goes beyond giving hope, healing, and closure to the millions of us who have lost children or loved ones no matter what the cause of their transition; it brings reality - - real, normal, everyday communication, enlightenment, a conscious awakening, a dawning of a new way of thinking, acting, and viewing this finite world we inhabit. Dr. La Batto introduces freedom to all through concrete, reproducible, verifiable experiences, opening all to the gifts our children and loved ones have given us. They are our teachers, courageously fulfilling their mission to be our guides and healers. Spirituality, not religion, facts, not fiction, are what we are here to experience. As you will see, Linda presents herself to him in the now as their journeys interweave, and he shares these experiences and knowing with all. He includes time, dates, locations, and real events to bring her to you. She communicates with him through his five senses; sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, but also through his heart, thoughts, emotions, humor, music, objects, lights, movies, phones, messengers, healers, guides, angels, mediums, meditations, and out-of-body experiences. Since he is not unique, Dr. La Batto ascertains what follows will be very familiar to many of you. His words will resonate inside of you an awakening within you of your own individual journey, your own knowing with your children and loved ones. You shall come to realize your own training and preparation for the lifting of your veil, recognizing the gifts your children have bestowed upon you. Dr. La Batto has no innate ability as do many of the people he introduces to you. He shares what he learns through curiosity, exploration, courage, participation and guidance from Linda. Simply put, if writing this book helps one person to learn how to experience their child or loved one as truly alive beyond this physical world, that life eternal is real, then Dr. La Batto and Linda&amp;rsquo;s intentions have been fulfilled!&lt;/p&gt;" />
