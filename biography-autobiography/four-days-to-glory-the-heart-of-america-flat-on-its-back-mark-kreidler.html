  <title>Four Days to Glory: The Heart of America, Flat on Its Back - Mark Kreidler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Somewhere beyond the circle of money, glitz, drugs, and controversy that characterizes professional sports in America, remnants of an ideal exist. In Iowa, that ideal survives in the form of high school wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Each a three-time state champion, Jay Borschel and Dan LeClere have a chance in their senior year to join the sport&#39;s most elite group: the &quot;four-timers,&quot; wrestlers who win four consecutive state titles. For Jay, a ferocious competitor who feeds off criticism and doubt, a victory would mean vindication over the great mass of skeptics waiting for him to fail. For Dan, who carries on his back the burdens of his tiny farming community, the dreams of his hard-driving coach and father, and his own personal demons, another title is the only acceptable outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Days to Glory&lt;/em&gt; is the story of America as told through its small towns and their connection to sport the way it was once routinely perceived: as a means of mattering to the folks next door. &lt;/p&gt;" />
