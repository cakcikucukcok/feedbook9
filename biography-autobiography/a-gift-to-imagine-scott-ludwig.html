  <title>A Gift to Imagine - Scott Ludwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite comic strips is Bill Wattersons Calvin and Hobbes. Its based on the adventures and misadventures of six-year old Calvin and his stuffed tiger Hobbes. However, in Calvins mind Hobbes is the real deal, and the interactions between the two of them reflect that of a young boy and his living, breathing tiger friend. Calvins imagination is the stimulus of one of the most beloved, humorous and heart-warming comic strips of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin is the antithesis of what is going on in the world today. Creativity and imagination seem to have taken a leave of absence recently. Movies and television shows are constantly being remade. New magazines look a lot like those already found on the newsstands. Television commercials are, for the most part sorely lacking in appeal. Radio commercials? Even worse: Same old song, same old story, same old same old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I love most about my grandson Krischan is his imagination Ive seen him invent an entire game using only a couple of sticks, a handful of rocks and an ant bed. Ive stood by his side as he saw and battled imaginary creatures so passionately I could have sworn I saw them too. Ive heard him create words for things that make so much more sense to me than the actual word he should be using. The boy has such a vivid imagination I make sure to pay close attention so I dont miss out on what he does or says next. He is, in a word Calvin. Coincidentally my nickname for him since the day he was born is Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have very single book chronicling the exploits of Calvin and Hobbes. Ive been saving them for Krischan so one day he can appreciate the magic Bill Watterson has created. I cant think of anyone better to pass the books along to, and hope Krischan will be eager to tear into them once he learns how to read.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After he reads this book first, of course.&lt;/p&gt;" />
