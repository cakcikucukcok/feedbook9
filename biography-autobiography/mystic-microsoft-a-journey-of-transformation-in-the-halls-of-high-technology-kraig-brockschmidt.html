  <title>Mystic Microsoft: A Journey of Transformation In the Halls of High Technology - Kraig Brockschmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where do you go to grow spiritually? A church? A monastery? India? Tibet? What about the heart of corporate multinationalism? Mystic Microsoft demonstrates that with sincerity and self-offering, God can (and will) guide one&#39;s inner growth in any setting, not just formal religious channels. Here, one of Microsoft&#39;s most visible technology experts during its major growth years relates how his career circumstances were the vehicle for an inward transformation. With insight, wit, and colorful anecdotes about life at Microsoft, Brockschmidt shows how one&#39;s career, like his experience writing the Windows Calculator and his book, Inside OLE 2, are tremendous opportunities for spiritual growth. &quot;[At Microsoft] I learned and experienced exactly what you would expect [in] a monastery or ashram...&quot; Mystic Microsoft offers hope to those who feel that their careers are at odds with their inner aspirations and those who seek to find a deeper meaning in their worldly responsibilities. www.mysticmicrosoft.com" />
