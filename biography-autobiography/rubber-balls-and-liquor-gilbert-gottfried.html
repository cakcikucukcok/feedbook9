  <title>Rubber Balls and Liquor - Gilbert Gottfried</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever reads this part of the book. Somebody at the publishing house explained to me that it&#39;s actually called the book flap. That sounded dirty, so I giggled for three hours. But it says in my contract that I have to write something over here in this tiny space, even though I don&#39;t think anyone will notice. Some people might open up to the middle of the book and start flipping through pages, but nobody will read this part. In fact, I&#39;ll bet anything that you&#39;re not reading this part now. And if it turns out that you are . . . well, the guy in the bookstore is probably staring at you, saying, &quot;Stop reading that book!&quot; I guess there&#39;s a reason bookstores are going out of business, left and right. Cheap fucks like you think it&#39;s okay to stand in the aisles and read to your heart&#39;s content. So for the sake of bookstores everywhere, buy this fucking book. I myself don&#39;t care. I only care about the poor working man. Oh, and the sanctity of the written word. I care about that, too. And in my case, those written words, of course, include fuck, dick, and pussy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
