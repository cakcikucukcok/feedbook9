  <title>Bastards, Bitches, and Heroes - Herman I Neuman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the horrors of our family which started during World War II in Germany, and continued for years thereafter because our father abandoned us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After twenty court processes, involving two dozen lawyers and judges, our family lost everything. My little brother, Siggi, and I suffered severe illnesses, starvation and homelessness. When we were about five and seven, our mother forced us to scavenge pig&#39;s innards from a manure pile. With the ever-present wire whip that she usually kept pinned to her skirt, she enticed us to eat them. A judge evicted us from our home. On Christmas Eve Day. For one year we squatted in a stranger&#39;s attic without water, sewer, heat, power or hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were fourteen and sixteen, our relatives invited us to America. We now thought that our lives would improve: Cowboys and Indians! But when we later arrived on their dairy farms, they enslaved us. I was not allowed to bathe but once a year. At the age of twenty-one, I still lived without water, heat, power, or outhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we finally escaped, Siggi and I worked our way through college, became American citizens and world travelers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
