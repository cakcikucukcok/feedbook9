  <title>Jokes My Father Never Taught Me - Rain Pryor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loving yet brutally honest memoir of the daughter of comedy legend Richard Pryor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rain Pryor was born in the idealistic, free-love 1960s. Her mother was a Jewish go-go dancer who wanted a tribe of rainbow children, and her father was Richard Pryor, perhaps the most compelling and brilliant comedian of his era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this intimate, harrowing, and often hilarious memoir, Rain talks about her divided heritage, and about the forces that shaped her wildly schizophrenic childhood. In her father&#39;s house, she bonded with Richard&#39;s grandmother, Mamma, a one-time whorehouse madam who never tired of reminding Rain that she was black. In her mother&#39;s house, and in the home of her Jewish grandparents, Rain was a &quot;mocha-colored Jewish princess,&quot; learning how to cook everything from kugel to beef brisket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed as if Rain was blessed with the best of both worlds, but it didn&#39;t quite work out that way. Life at Mom&#39;s was unstable in the extreme, while at Richard&#39;s place Rain was exposed to sex and drugs before she had even learned to read. &quot;Daddy,&quot; she told her father one day, sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner at the advanced age of eight, &quot;the whores need to be paid.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jokes My Father Never Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; is both lovingly told and painfully frank: the story of a girl who grew up adoring her father even as she feared him&amp;#8212;and feared &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; him&amp;#8212;as his drug problems grew worse. In 1980 Pryor tried to kill himself by setting himself on fire, then joked that it had been an accident: &quot;No one ever told me you couldn&#39;t mix cookies with two types of milk!&quot; In his later years, Pryor succumbed to multiple sclerosis, and Rain watched in tears as her father became a shell of his former self. Once, in an unusually introspective mood, Pryor asked his daughter, &quot;Why do you love me, Rainy, when I can be so mean?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jokes My Father Never Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; answers that poignant question and many more. It is an unprecedented look at the life of a legend of comedy, told by a daughter who both understood the genius and knew the tortured man within. &lt;/p&gt;" />
