  <title>Music in Disney&#39;s Animated Features - James Bohn, Jeff Kurtti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Music in Disney&amp;#8217;s Animated Features&lt;/i&gt; James Bohn investigates how music functions in Disney animated films and identifies several vanguard techniques used in them. In addition he also presents a history of music in Disney animated films, as well as biographical information on several of the Walt Disney Studios&amp;#8217; seminal composers.&lt;p&gt;The popularity and critical acclaim of Disney animated features truly is built as much on music as it is on animation. Beginning with &lt;i&gt;Steamboat Willie&lt;/i&gt; and continuing through all of the animated features created under Disney&amp;#8217;s personal supervision, music was the organizing element of Disney&amp;#8217;s animation. Songs establish character, aid in narrative, and fashion the backbone of the Studios&amp;#8217; movies from &lt;i&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/i&gt; through &lt;i&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/i&gt; and beyond.&lt;p&gt;Bohn underscores these points while presenting a detailed history of music in Disney&amp;#8217;s animated films. The book includes research done at the Walt Disney Archives as well as materials gathered from numerous other facilities. In his research of the Studios&amp;#8217; notable composers, Bohn includes perspectives from family members, thus lending a personal dimension to his presentation of the magical Studios&amp;#8217; musical history. The volume&amp;#8217;s numerous musical examples demonstrate techniques used throughout the Studios&amp;#8217; animated classics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
