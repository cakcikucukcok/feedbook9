  <title>When It&#39;s Not as Simple as the Birds and the Bees - Sandhya M. Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandhya&#39;s life was magical. She married her best friend, Tyler Graves, and a few short months later, their dreams of growing their family became a reality - she was pregnant. Yet, three short months later, on the very night they were out celebrating the end of their first trimester, Sandhya had to be rushed to the hospital. Amidst the sterile rooms of the emergency room and the unfriendly, cold resident on duty, Sandhya and Ty were told their baby had died. Stunned and shaken, they went home to await the physical and emotional pain and grief that comes with miscarrying a baby. Little did they know, their dreams of having a family would be years away. Their struggle with infertility, in-vitro fertilization, repeated pregnancy loss and serious health issues plagued them for the next several years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
