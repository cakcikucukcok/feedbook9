  <title>Odyssey  of a Great Lakes Sailor - Ranga Iyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This odyssey is about my life experiences as a Chief Engineer on board Canadian Lakers , as they were called.
It is also an expose into the inside workings of a Shipping company, namely Canada Steamship Lines inc. where I gave my blood, sweat and tears to make a living as a new immigrant in a so called first world country.
This book is written to expose the inside workings of a Shipping company during the years that I toiled to make a living as a man seeking to make a livelihood in supposedly a great country. It is not the country that is to blame but people like Mr. Martin who are so twisted that they lose sight of the common man and use them and abuse them for their personal gain.
The book gives a true account as to how one large corporation hounded one individual who spoke the truth and who sought justice and who wanted to make a change and to make the scenery better for future generations of Sea going personnel. 
The book also gives you page-by-page description of how a corporation self-destructs. Surely there must be a lesson in all this.
Experiences included in the book are mind-boggling. They include Shipping accidents, shipboard assaults, battery, Companys BLACKLIST, which includes a list of so  called undesirables, pollution, environmental and ecological damage. Mergers and acquisitions, dismissals and corporate lynching, witch hunt, Human Rights issues, illegal constitutional changes, changing pension laws and the Canada Shipping act illegally to suit the ship owner, Corporate Corruption and greed.
There is one chapter solely on Shipboard assaults and a list of undesirables that sailed the Lakers.
It gives me great satisfaction to know that I could share my experiences with a wide variety of Human Beings and I am sure people who read my book would be flabbergasted when they get to know as to what goes on behind the scenes of a Maritime Industry of a G-8 Country.
How soon one forgets that we sailors help to  build the wealth of a nation by carrying goods that helps to grow the nations economy and that we sailors have also helped fight the enemy during the first and second world wars and also make a major contribution in feeding an entire nation.
It is also a book about vengeance and Revenge-an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.. 
Just like Edmond Dantes In the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas.
To pray sometimes for a man, who like Satan thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom. 
There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living.
&quot;Live then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - `Wait and hope. Your friend,
&quot;Edmond Dantes, Count of Monte Cristo.&quot;
Above all it is one mans search for truth and justice, and a triumph of adversity--a true Sailors Odyssey." />
