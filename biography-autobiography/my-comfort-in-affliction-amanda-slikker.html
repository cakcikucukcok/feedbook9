  <title>My Comfort in Affliction - Amanda Slikker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amanda Slikkers story begins on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at the US Naval Academy. Two months into her navy career, she was enjoying the first and, as it turns out, only rugby game she would ever play. During one of the plays, the head of one of the players slammed into her chin, throwing her jaw out of place and putting her in excruciating pain. This injury would change her life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda became a Christian as a child and was outspoken about her faith while at school. Even so, her beliefs were never challenged until she faced agonizing pain. She had countless surgeries, each one weakening her health a bit more. As time went on, she wondered why God was making her go through this unbelievable pain. She had been a healthy child growing up and did not know how to deal with this kind of suffering. She found herself questioning the truths she had learned from the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Comfort in Affliction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a profoundly personal journey through Amandas struggles with her faith. She shares her prayers, thoughts, and the Scripture that gave her peace and hope during her unexpected tribulations. God led Amanda through her physical pain and with His hand pulled her to the mountains filled with joy and peace. Her story is a testament to Gods faithfulness and everlasting love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
