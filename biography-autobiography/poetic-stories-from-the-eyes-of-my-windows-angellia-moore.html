  <title>Poetic Stories from the Eyes of My Windows - Angellia Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Poetic Stories from the Eyes of My Windows&lt;/i&gt; presents a compilation of personal and heartfelt stories written in poetic form. Author Angellia Moore reveals her memories of love, death, illnesses, and suicide, sharing her stories through verse. 
The poems in this collection were inspired by actual people around her, actual events in her life, and ideas in her head and heart. No two stories are alike; each one tells its own tale and takes on its own design and meaning. Setting the scene for each carefully, she explores a variety of topics, moments, and memories.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prayer for Black Boys
Dear God,
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray for Black Boys on the street.
I pray that they will make good choices
Let them hear their mamas voices.
Son, grow up and do whats right
I pray that youll come home tonight &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Her remarkable gift of dreaming and writing is no longer a vision but a reality. She has put her writing skills into a remarkable book of poems. These poems made me laugh, and they made me think about how I have the power to make a positive influence in this world.
Harriet S. Stephens, Lieutenant Colonel, Retired, US Army
Angellia&#39;s poetry is respectful, insightful, and uplifting.  She is brave, bold, and inspiring. Her poetry wakes my sleeping soul.
