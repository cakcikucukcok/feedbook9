  <title>Dixieland Delight: A Football Season on the Road in the Southeastern Conference - Clay Travis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no college ball more passionate and competitive than football in the Southeastern Conference, where seven of the twelve schools boast stadiums bigger than any in the NFL and 6.5 million fans hit the road every year to hoot and holler their teams to victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2006, popular sports columnist and lifelong University of Tennessee fan Clay Travis set out on his &quot;Dixieland Delight Tour.&quot; Without a single map, hotel reservation, or game ticket, he began an 8,000-mile journey through the beating heart of the Southland. As Travis toured the SEC, he immersed himself in the bizarre game-day rituals of the common fan, brazenly dancing with the chancellor&#39;s wife at a Vanderbilt frat party, hanging with University of Florida demigod quarterback Tim Tebow, and abandoning himself totally to the ribald intensity and religious fervor of SEC football. &lt;em&gt;Dixieland Delight&lt;/em&gt; is Travis&#39;s hilarious, loving, irreverent, and endlessly entertaining chronicle of a season of ironic excess in a world that goes a little crazy on football Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;" />
