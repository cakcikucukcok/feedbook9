  <title>In Vitro: My Journey Through the World of Ivf - Anastasia Sputnik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a personal testimony from a patient who underwent 15 In Vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments over a 7 year period. It is a story about male infertility combined with the females fertility declined with the age, which lead the partners to proceed with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) as the only option. In todays western world one in every six couples face fertility problems and this story could become a reality for millions of couples in the world. This book is raising awareness about female fertility and reproductivity potential for women after their mid-thirties. It also reveals some of the hidden truths and misconceptions about IVF and demystifies information provided by the press and media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar book with details of the latest IVF trends, facts and experiences from the patients perspective has never been published. The first part of the book is a chronicle of the authors experiences as an IVF patient, where she shares medical information, facts, experience and lessons learned during IVF treatments. In the second part of the book the author is offering valuable advice, recommendations, and tools, including tips on how to save money for IVF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a patients story about the emotional impact of IVF. The book is unique in presenting a serious family and marriage crisis throughout battles with infertility and how the journey through the IVF drastically affected the couples relationship. It is also a story of a personal life crisis that the female patient was going through. The author describes her own turmoil when she decided to end IVF (IVF closure) after many years of living in the IVF bubble, when she faced not only the cruel fact that she will never be able to have more children, but also experienced a career failure, financial difficulties and her husband being ready to leave her due to the inability to have a big family together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is also a relevant resource for medical practitioners to better understand patients physical and emotional needs and improve the service in IVF clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote from the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My greatest hope is that reading this book leads to positive outcomes for as many women and couples as possible!&lt;/p&gt;" />
