  <title>The Spirit of Pan Passion Amore Nature - Nick Arborea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the extraordinary true story of a man some know as Nick and others know as lartista, a multi-creative talent; this memoir explores the mystery behind his life. As a child growing up in Italy, Nick had his dreams: to sing, to learn English, and to one day live and work in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his family immigrated to Australia, his father had made other plans for him, and Nick worked as a tiler/labourer to help support his family. But his young life would change forever the day he made an award-winning clay mask. The mask awoke the ancient spirit of the pagan god Pan, master of the woods; Nicks life would never be the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the decision to put the many challenges of his lifeschool bullies, patronising parents who didnt support his dreams, and no hopebehind him. He left home and worked hard, but success eluded him at every turn. He clung to the hope that he would at least find love in this new life, but that too remained just a dream. He was handsome, confident, charming, and had a lot of natural class and charisma that men envied and women admired, but even he couldnt find true love. His life began to change when he threw away the mask of Pan, which now rests at the bottom of the sea somewhere off Brighton Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the karmic journey of a mans self-discovery at midlife, from failed ambitions to spiritual enlightenment, and his unbreakable determination to never give up. &lt;/p&gt;" />
