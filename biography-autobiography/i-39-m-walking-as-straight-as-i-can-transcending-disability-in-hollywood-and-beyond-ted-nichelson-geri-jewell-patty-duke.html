  <title>I&#39;m Walking as Straight as I Can: Transcending Disability in Hollywood and Beyond - Ted Nichelson, Geri Jewell, Patty Duke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot; class=MsoNormal&gt;Exposing real pain, unstoppable perseverance, and unquestionable faith in the human spirit, this autobiography offers a true glimpse beyond the one-dimensional, hero image often associated with actress Geri Jewell. Born with cerebral palsy, Jewell made history when she became the first person with a disability cast in a recurring role on American television in&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;The Facts of Life&lt;/I&gt;, and in the years that followed she experienced a string of other successes, including a performance at the White House in 1985 and a role on HBO&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Deadwood&lt;/I&gt; series. Along with Jewell&amp;#8217;s accomplishments, this personal story also depicts some of the less-than-rosy events that happened behind closed doors during her initial climb to fame&amp;#151;among them, her release from &lt;I&gt;The Facts of Life&lt;/I&gt;, her manager&amp;#8217;s embezzlement of the money she made on the show, and her struggle with chronic pain, despair, and a fear of revealing her true sexual identity. Told with grace and humor, this inspirational narrative presents an honest portrayal of a woman who refused to give up when others kept knocking her down.&lt;/P&gt;" />
