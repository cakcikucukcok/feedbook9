  <title>Fifty Years of Resumes and Passport Stamps - Elizabeth Lydia Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is amusing, inspiring, and touching. Fifty Years of Resumes and Passport Stamps shares Elizabeth Lydia Palmers journey through life. Go to work with her as her career in data processing follows the development of computersfrom mechanical accounting machines and punched-card systems to minicomputers, mainframes, and databases. Through hirings and firings, Elizabeth shares the accolades she received from bosses and the criticisms when she was the subject of a case study in how to deal with an incompetent employee.
Teaching computer software classes, attending volleyball clinics, and joining family activities put some unusual, out-of-the-ordinary trips on Elizabeths calendar. Travel with her as she climbs Mt. Fuji to watch the sunrise, braves the border guards in iron-curtained Czechoslovakia, files past Pope John Paul Is body as he lies in state in St. Peters Basilica, watches for white smoke announcing a new pope, smokes a peace pipe in Colorado and a water pipe in Istanbul, scalps tickets at the Montreal Olympics, and skiis at the Womens Olympic Downhill Run in Innsbruck.
Elizabeths Fifty Years of Resumes and Passport Stamps offers anecdotes of marrying, raising four children in Illinois, Texas, Ottawa, and California, surviving cancer, divorcing after thirty years, dating after age fifty, and finally filing away her rsums as she retires." />
