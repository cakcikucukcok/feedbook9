  <title>Heart and Sole - Jane Eldershaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;There are only two kinds of women in the world, those who love shoes and those who had the misfortune to be born without the ability to experience total bliss on finding a pair of perfectly designed pumps in the right size at half price.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heart and Sole&lt;/i&gt; is a lighthearted illustrated memoir, full of wisdom and humor, of one woman&#39;s life through her shoes. Jane Eldershaw remembers the shoes she has loved, the ones that turned out to be terrible mistakes, and the important life lessons she learned along the way. She writes about her first pair of heels (and the battle she had with her mother to get them), the white go-go boots and wooden platform shoes of her youth, and the power of red shoes, as well as how to judge a man by his shoes and the importance of girlfriends when shopping for footwear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heart and Sole&lt;/i&gt; dishes out shoe advice, fashion memories, and warmhearted observations on the shoes of our lives. The perfect gift for every shoe diva and footwear lover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
