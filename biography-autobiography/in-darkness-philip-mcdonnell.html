  <title>In Darkness - Philip McDonnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Darkness&#39; is about my early years and being abandoned by my mother and her family in 1947. A child prisoner handed over to the Catholic Church to be raised by the nuns/brothers until my sixteenth birthday. Where the wrath of God and the fear of God was tested on sinned children daily. My dreams and make belief of how my mother lived before I ruined it and the small rays of light that shone through the darkness of my youth. My first meeting with my mother in St Helen&#39;s and the anger shown to me by her stepfather when I first met him working in his field on my mother&#39;s own father&#39;s farm. The hospital miracle which left the doctors and trainee doctors scratching their heads and my inner fear of how life would be outside the institution as the gate to freedom opened.In Darkness&#39; is about my early years and being abandoned by my mother and her family in 1947.
