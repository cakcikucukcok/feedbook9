  <title>Ryan Korban - Ryan Korban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ryan Korban has redefined luxury for a new generation, with an approach to interior design that infuses a timeless sensibility with a sense of lost romance, sex, fantasy, and a strong fashion influence. In this beautiful book filled with more than one hundred full-color photographs, the acclaimed interior designer, who is making a career of translating this aesthetic into elegant, comfortable interiors, shows readers how to achieve a sense of luxury in their homes that is at once glamorous and highly personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the book&amp;#39;s seven thematic chapters focuses on a key component or influence that is essential to Korban&amp;#39;s approach to decorating, and offers numerous sources of inspiration and innovative ideas. Every section also includes an introductory essay that explains his point of view on the subject, followed by a seamless flow of captioned images that expresses it in detail and from various visual perspectives. The photographs of spaces he has designed&amp;#8212;including homes for celebrity clients&amp;#8212;are complemented by images from fashion, advertising, fine art, and design that will inspire readers with their compelling juxtaposition and enhance the luxurious aesthetic. A Sources section listing Korban&amp;#39;s go-to shops for everything from flowers to furniture rounds out this stunning book that is as alluring as the spaces featured within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 100 full-color photographs throughout&lt;/p&gt;" />
