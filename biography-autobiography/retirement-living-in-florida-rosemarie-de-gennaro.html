  <title>Retirement Living in Florida - Rosemarie De Gennaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Retirement in Florida is a dream for many but not for this New Yorker. With much humor, Rosemarie De Gennaro explains her attempts, and ultimate failures, to adjust to southern living and her hopes to return to her family and life back home on Long Island. All her life, she has prayed for spiritual guidance and followed the answers, even when those answers were undesirable. This was true in her move to Florida, which was all planned as part of her mission in life. A new friendship enriched her and inspired her to write about her experiences. This special bond between two very different women who had meetings of the soul ended all too soon when her friends mission was complete. Take this inspirational journey from New York to Florida, and learn some valuable information if you are contemplating a move." />
