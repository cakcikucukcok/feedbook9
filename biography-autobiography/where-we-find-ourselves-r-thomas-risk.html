  <title>Where We Find Ourselves - R. Thomas Risk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Day, 6-year-old Randolph runs into the family room and cries, Daddy! Two men  William and Cyrus  answer his call. In his quest to unravel the mystery of two fathers, which leads to a reunion with his birth mother and the exposure of grim secrets William tried to bury half a century ago, Randolph rediscovers himself. Thirty-three years after that ominous Christmas Day, as William tries to atone from his deathbed for a lifetime of deceit, Randolph realizes that he has solved a far greater question: Does God exist? The practical implications of his answer will astonish you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where We Find Ourselves is a true story, told by one of those rare individuals in whom the old world and the new coalesce. In this tale of betrayal and liberation, R. Thomas Risk enlists the analytical skills of a lawyer, the savvy of an investigator and the eloquence of an award-winning poet to forever change your perception of societys sacred institutions  the three most insidious of which are Religion, Celebrity and National Politics  a positively unholy trinity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
