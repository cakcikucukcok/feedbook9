  <title>Homebound No More - Blaise Dismer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Blaise Dismer sits in his apartment in Denver, afraid to leave. He suffers from a fear-based disorder called agoraphobia. But years after suffering his first panic attack on his twenty-first birthday, he doesnt know exactly whats wrong. All he knows is the fear of embarrassment looms, and home is where he must stay. 
In this autobiographical account, Blaise explains how the nightmarish disorder affected his life, how he was finally diagnosed and how he overcame the disorder to live a productive live. As you read his inspirational story, you will learn how he relied on cognitive behavior therapy, medication, and other tools to help fight agoraphobia and how he found the courage to slough off shame and the fear of embarrassment. He describes how he deals with an anxiety disorder on a daily basis and how the disorder has affected his friends and family. 
Regardless of whether you suffer from anxiety disorder yourself, or whether you have a loved one waging a similar battle, youll find hope and practical guidance in this autobiography. Break out of your prison and overcome your fears with &lt;i&gt;Homebound No More.&lt;/i&gt;
Blaises story epitomizes the bright externally successful, sensitive people that I generally see in my office. They live like duckscalm on the outside and peddling like hell underneath.
