  <title>Alice in Genderland - Richard J. Novic M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice in Genderland &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is the first ever memoir by a crossdresser who is not content to live behind closed doorsand who takes it much further than his straighter, more circumspect peers might ever care to go. Most of the time, Harvard-educated psychiatrist Richard Novic is Rick, a man at the office or a husband and father at home. But one night a week, he is Alice, a woman about town, shopping, dining, dancing, and dating a man for nearly a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to the life he leads today, Rick Novic suffered since his sporty, nerdy boyhood with a secret, a desire he was in no way equipped to handle, but one that eventually burst through his denial, a few months before his wedding day. Just once, he felt, while he still could, he had to know how it felt to be a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Alice in Wonderland, his curiosity led him to fall headlong down a rabbit hole, through desperate straits, mind-opening surprises, heart-rending changes, gritty sex, and boundless love. By the time he was back on his feet, he was a different person, living a lifestyle he hadnt known existed. Anyone who has struggled to figure out who they are and how they want to live will surely appreciate this informative and engaging life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Alice in Genderland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few know the transgender scene like GIRL TALK magazines Alice Novic. This exciting new memoir by her male alter ego takes us along with him and the people he loves, as he encounters and explores each twist and turn around him and within him. As much Lewis and Clark as it is Lewis Carroll, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice in Genderland &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blazes a new trail in the world of crossdressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Jensen, contributing writer, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transgender Forum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice bravely explores the limits of gender, sexuality, and relationshipsa sexy, poignant, and often hilarious memoir of transgenderism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vernon A. Rosario, M.D., author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Erotic Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, clinical faculty, UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More provocative than soothing, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alice in Genderland &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is fascinating and well worth reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vern L. Bullough, Ph.D., author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;past president of the Society of the Scientific Study of Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
