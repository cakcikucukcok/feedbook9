  <title>Into the Great Unknown - Maurice Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Author Maurice Harvey returns with another collection of exciting firsthand stories from his time as a missionary and as the Bible Society photojournalist. He recounts many of his firsthand experiences over the years as an international photojournalist in Into the Great Unknown. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The memoir begins with Maurice leaving the safety of his New Zealand home as a young man in the 1960s and heading into deepest Africabound for the war-ravaged Congo region. From there, the story continues as Maurice travels across the African continent, through post-Communist Eastern Europe, and then into Asia. His final stop is the mysterious and formidable state of North Korea.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Told with compassion and charm, these stories reflect an eye for the quirky as well the poignant. Leaving New Zealand isolated and far away from everywhere else, was for a young man in 1960, truly an adventure into the unknown. But with the strong assurance that God was with him, it became an adventure of excitement and great enjoyment.&lt;/P&gt;" />
