  <title>Luke 8:48 a Supernatural Journey of Faith - Donna Davenport Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles are everywhere, if only well open our hearts and minds in belief that were never alone. Luke 8:48 A Supernatural Journey of Faith, reaffirms there are countless benevolent forces across the universe to help us. The true story of how my Dad never once lost his faith, despite a lifetime of horrible pain and suffering. Plagued with adversity from birth, he remained steadfast in his beliefs. This journey of unspeakable suffering and impenetrable faith would last for over sixty years, leading to a visiting angel with the message that his torment was over, he was healed. 
My unusual childhood allowed me to witness many miracles surrounding him and our family. Little did I know, these supernatural events would pave the way for a personal connection with the Other Side after my own near death experience. Join me on this amazing journey of love, mystery, paranormal happenings, pain, and blessings." />
