  <title>Get Me A Celebrity! - Stanley Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Get Me A Celebrity!&quot; is a frank but funny account of working with popular celebrities by someone who has enjoyed a unique access to them over the last twenty years. Through his company, Performing Artistes, Stanley Jackson hires famous people on behalf of clients based in the UK and overseas. Using autobiographical material gleaned from two successful business careers, Stanley does not pull any punches about the highs and lows of working with celebrities; but his account is always relevant, informative, and hugely entertaining. We learn why Nick Leeson, the rogue trader who brought down Barings Bank, is an acceptable speaker for city clients, whereas Major Charles Ingram, who cheated on &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; is not. We get the inside track on why Pierluigi Collina was forced to choose between advertising Vauxhall Vectras or continuing as the world&#39;s best referee; and the pressures of being mega famous includes an hilarious account of what it was like being on the road with the late George Best. Other situations explored include: Getting the best out of TV presenter Ruby Wax, attempting to moderate comedienne Jo Brand, what goes into a well-crafted speech, the role of agents, the crucial role of TV exposure. All are tackled with an honesty built on mutual respect for the celebrities involved but driven by the imperative to prime an audience for a talented performer. With a fulsome foreword by the indefatigable Gyles Brandreth, &quot;Get Me A Celebrity!&quot; is a must read for anybody who likes reading about how the stars of media, sport, business, politics and entertainment, can earn a handsome living in addition to their day jobs" />
