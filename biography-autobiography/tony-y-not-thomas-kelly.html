  <title>Tony-Y-Not - Thomas Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a true description of a man who got lost in a sea of alcohol. His story reflects upon the brutal honesty of a man in total denial of who he was and what he had become and his journey back to his friends and family. You will experience through reading this book the humility, the tears, and the joy of his journey and being accepted back into the world he was trying to escape from.  
We hope this book will reach out to others who have lost all hope and inspire them to get up, shake themselves down, and ask for help. Tony asked for help and still today he says he cant do life on his own. He accepts that he can never drink again, and his last drink can be his last drink a day at a time. Tonys message to you is when you are saying to yourself Why me? Why me? think to yourself, Well, why not?" />
