  <title>Twenty-Twenty Hindsight - Mosiuoa Sekese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-twenty hindsight means perfect understanding
of events only after they have happened. In his book,
Mosiuoa Sekese looks back on his life in the old and new
South Africa and gives his own perceptive interpretation
of the past events. Sekese suffered discrimination and
prejudice under the old apartheid government as well as
the new, democratic regime. His story is highly personal,
but provides the reader with unique insights into the
social and educational challenges that South Africa
continues to grapple with.
I had a quick read and I fi nd the content heartbreaking but
fascinating. Especially as a white South African you are drawing
me into a world that I always knew existed, but which few people
have the guts and conviction to paint into words.
