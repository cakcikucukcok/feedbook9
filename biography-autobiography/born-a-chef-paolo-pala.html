  <title>Born a Chef - Paolo Pala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;When my uncle came back he couldnt see Antonio. He started to call, Antonio Antonio, where are you?
There was no answer. My uncle walked all over his Su Quilli calling for Antonio when he turned around.
Nothing could have prepared him for the gruesome scene before him: his nephew in a pool of blood. How
he must have felt then, he nearly died himself. Something like that just doesnt happen, not even in horror
films.&#39;
All my life I have been cooking great food for people, along the way I&#39;ve met some truly amazing people
and I&#39;ve so many stories to tell you. Read about my journey, how I learned to cook and try for yourself one
of my traditional italian recipes which accompany each chapter." />
