  <title>An Autobiography of a Man with a Psychiatric Disorder - Surya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book gives us the rare and meaningful insight that is not often found in the world of psychiatry and mental health, an area that, even today, a large proportion of society still associates with stigma and shame. This book is invaluable in that it presents a patients perspective to the reader, shedding new light on the amount of suffering a mental illness such as schizophrenia can cause. 
We are taken on a journey of the life of this man right from his earliest school days till present. We read and learn about the author as a young boy, a student, and as a young man when the first symptoms of his illness began to manifest. We then follow the whole course of the author&#39;s struggle with his illness and recovery. Throughout the entire course of the narrative, the author does a brilliant job of explaining the thoughts, the experiences, and the struggle he experienced as a victim of mental illness in such a way that the reader is unable to read without empathizing and question how it would feel if their own mind were to turn against them in such a way." />
