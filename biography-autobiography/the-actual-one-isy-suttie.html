  <title>The Actual One - Isy Suttie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hilarious, razor-sharp debut memoir about the moment when you realize that your friends have all grown up and left you behind, for readers of Caitlin Moran&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;How To Be A Woman&lt;/em&gt;, Jenny Lawson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/em&gt;, and Kelly Williams Brown&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Adulting.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isy Suttie wakes up one day in her late twenties to discover that the deal she&amp;#8217;d struck with her friends, to put off growing up for as long as possible, had been entirely in her head. Everyone around her is suddenly into mortgages, farmers&amp;#8217; markets, and going off the Pill, rather than running naked into the sea or getting hammered in a country pub with eighty-year-old men.&lt;/p&gt;After a particularly crushing breakup precipitated by Isy&amp;#8217;s gifting of a human-size papier-m&amp;#226;ch&amp;#233; penguin to her boyfriend, her dearest friend advises Isy not to worry: the next guy she meets will be The Actual One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartened by this promise, Isy decides to keep delaying the onset of adulthood, whether that means standing on the side of a highway in nothing but an old fur coat and sneakers, dating a man who speaks only in rhyme, or conquering her fears of Alpine skiing by wildly overestimating her athletic ability.&amp;#160;Insightful and laugh-out-loud funny, &lt;em&gt;The Actual One&lt;/em&gt; is an ode to the confusing wilderness of your late twenties, alongside a quest for a genuinely good relationship . . . or at the very least, a good story to tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
