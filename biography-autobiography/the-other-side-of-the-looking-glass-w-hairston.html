  <title>The Other Side of the Looking Glass - W. Hairston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a memoir. Four years out of the life of an average American who did his time in service, only to find that he has to start over again in a country still at war and with a shattered economy. He finds that there is a way to make a living, and that is in the military-industrial complex, the new job market that had arisen when the Twin Towers fell on 9/11. 
In this world, he makes ends meet. He is able to support his family but is in the crosshairs of the enemy 24/7. All it takes is one mortar shell, one rocket strike, and one bullet to meet his fate. Although he is out of active military service, he is in a combat zone. His life is in danger, just like theirs, but for him, there are no welcome home parties and no yellow ribbons. Before, he was looked at as a hero; now, hes just an opportunist, a mercenary. But on this side, you see the way things are in this new world of outsourced war." />
