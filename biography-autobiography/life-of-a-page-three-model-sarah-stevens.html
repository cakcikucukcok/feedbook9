  <title>Life of a Page Three Model - Sarah Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is based on a true story about one of the best page three models of all time. Starting with the battles of adults and parents and the struggle of survival to make it even to teenage years, the model expresses deep solitude. To a complete change through the power of her Bible and letting God do her work and getting great reviews from national media, the model has a contrast of tears of happiness and tears of sadness. But the model somehow finds solutions to live life in a positive manner. This explains how one door will close and another can open. After vvthirteen years of success in that career, now the model is trained as a security officer.
A big thank-you to AuthorHouse for helping me share my life with others and for allowing me to express that love is everything and that we should allow our heart to follow our dreams. My mother tells me life is a journey. My advice is to listen and understand what is being said. Smile, and the world smiles with you. And that is what happened." />
