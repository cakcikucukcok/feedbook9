      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bear Grylls is a veritable superhero&amp;#8230;.The former UK Special Forces paratrooper has braved the world&amp;#8217;s harshest environments.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Hampton Sides, &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bear Grylls is one tough, crazy dude.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE THRILLING #1-BESTSELLING MEMOIR BY THE ADVENTURE LEGEND AND STAR OF NBC&#39;S&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;RUNNING WILD WITH BEAR GRYLLS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Grylls has always sought the ultimate in adventure. Growing up on a remote island off of Britain&#39;s windswept coast, he was taught by his father to sail and climb at an early age. Inevitably, it wasn&#39;t long before the young explorer was sneaking out to lead all-night climbing expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager at Eton College, Bear found his identity and purpose through both mountaineering and martial arts. These passions led him into the foothills of the mighty Himalayas and to a karate grandmaster&#39;s remote training camp in Japan, an experience that soon helped him earn a second-degree black belt. Returning home, he embarked upon the notoriously grueling selection course for the British Special Forces to join the elite Special Air Service unit 21 SAS&amp;#8212;a journey that would push him to the very limits of physical and mental endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, disaster. Bear broke his back in three places in a horrific free-fall parachuting accident in Africa. It was touch and go whether he would walk again, according to doctors. However, only eighteen months later, a twenty-three-year-old Bear became one of the youngest climbers to scale Mount Everest, the world&#39;s highest summit. But this was just the beginning of his many extraordinary adventures. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known and admired by millions as the star of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Man vs. Wild&lt;/em&gt;, Bear Grylls has survived where few would dare to go. Now, for the first time, Bear tells the story of his action-packed life. Gripping, moving, and wildly exhilarating,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Mud, Sweat, and Tears&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a must-read for adrenaline junkies and armchair explorers alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
