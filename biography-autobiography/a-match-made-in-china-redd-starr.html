  <title>A Match Made in China - Redd Starr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Redd Starr heard it all as the years passed by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Why havent you found someone yet? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;When are you going to find yourself a wife? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Dont you want to find someone? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth was that he had been looking for someone for quite some time. But, he could not find her. He tried dating women from church with no success. He tried dating many other different types of women as well with no luck at all. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief encounter with an Asian woman, he began to wonder if perhaps he should take a more serious look at Asian women - more specifically, Chinese women. After all, he already knew he loved the food and their culture. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasnt long before he was on an International dating website, chatting with dozens of women, and trying to narrow down his choices. He was now on a mission to find his future wife. But, he would need to gather as much information as he could to actually find her, and then to bring her to America. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author as he goes to China to find the woman of his dreams in a story that proves the secret formula to any relationship can be found in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 Love never fails. &lt;/p&gt;" />
