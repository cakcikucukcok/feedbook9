  <title>Wisconsin 1 Step at a Time - Bradley Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bradley Carlsons muscular dystrophy causes brutal leg cramps that leave him crumpled on the floor. He cant climb stairs and curbs, and sometimes he cant even move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of that stopped him from putting his best foot forward and walking through his home state of Wisconsin. He walked through 595 incorporated cities, trekking from Lake Michigan to the mighty Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his journey, he experienced his share of falls and challenges, but he also met incredible people, enjoyed special moments, and witnessed the breathtaking beauty of his home state, including waterfalls, desert-like dunes along Lake Michigan, and picturesque mountaintops and forest views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley didnt set out on this journey to raise money or hand out brochures. He simply did it to show himself and others that someone with muscular dystrophy can accomplish great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll laugh, cry, meet new friends, and discover new places in this inspirational memoir about one mans refusal to give up while seeing &lt;i&gt;Wisconsin 1 Step at a Time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
