  <title>Beyond Their Years - Scotti Cohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes a war&amp;#39;s greatest heroes are its survivors, those who manage to forge new lives despite the tragedy they have experienced. For the sixteen unsung heroes profiled in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Beyond Their Years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, surviving also meant surrendering their childhood. These children found themselves on the edge of the fray - both in combat and in the throes of daily life - helping, or simply enduring, as best their interrupted youths allowed. Their behind-the-scenes stories illustrate what it was really like for children during the Civil War. Meet Ransom Powell, a thirteen-year-old drummer boy who survived grueling Confederate prison camps; writer and patriot Maggie Campbell, only eight years old when the war ended; Ulysses S. Grant&amp;#39;s son Jesse, who rode proudly alongside Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s son Tad and Ella Sheppard, daughter of a slave mother and a freed father, who lived through the backlash of slave rebellions. Each of these young survivors&amp;#39; lives represent an amazing contribution to the war effort and to postbellum life. Learn the inspiring stories of these American children who displayed courage, devotion, and wisdom beyond their years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
