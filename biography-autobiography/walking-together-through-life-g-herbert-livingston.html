  <title>Walking Together Through Life - G. Herbert Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am ninety- four years of age, and I have begun looking back over seventy-four years of being an ordained minister. I decided I should write a testimony of what God has done in the combined lives of my wife Maria and myself. We were married for almost seventy-two years when she died in 2009. This volume has the history of a long successful marriage.
At the beginning if the Great Depression, both of our parents lost control of their farms and had to depend on the government for income. Both of us were penniless farm teenagers. Taking a clue from the Scriptures that often refers to the experiences of life as a walk; we have used that term for our life together. We started lives in the valley of poverty and moved uphill from one achievement to another. This book is the story of that journey.
The main part of this book is a record of being a minister, a professor and over two decades of retirement. Without the expert assistance and encouragement of Maria, this goal would not have happened." />
