  <title>From Ivory Towers to Gun Towers - Barry Lew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I didn`t realize it early on, but my mother was emotionally insuring my survival in order that I become an M.D.and reciprocate. I carefully avoided any meaningful relationships for many years and focused on fulfilling the covenant with her. I attended the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and completed my training at the true &quot;ivory towers&quot; in medicine
I had kept my mother alive through four grave illnesses until her passing in 1977. I left the emptiness her loss created and began a new life in California. There, I believe I alnost achieved legendary status treating the medical and social needs of a population shunned and forgotten by society 
At the height of my success, I acquired a hotel on its own island in Belize and mingled with the participants of the &quot;Life Styles of the Rich and Famous&quot;.
And then, suddenly,in one untoward series of events, I  lost the degree and profession that I had spent a lifetime achieving. I was betrayed by a physician assistant who wrongfully accused me of masterminding his criminal activities. I was given the option of acting as an under cover agent for the Department of Justice. My attorneys had left me a position which I judged to be life threatening. I chose to survive and was led away to the harsh reality of the California Institue for Men.
I suvived my prison experience because of a sacred bond with Gregory Jolley or &quot;Rooster&quot;, originally  a hard core,level four inmate who shared a cell at one time with John Clutchette, one of the Soledad &quot;brothers&quot;. We defied the segregation in Chino at great personal risk.
But first, I had to discover the inner resourses that would allow me to transform myself into a respected &quot;convict&quot;.
I invite you to read the amazing details of this never before  articulated recount of a friendship in prison that defied all conventional wisdom." />
