  <title>And God Was Our Witness - Alicja Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was only sixteen when my family and I were pulled away from our home and country.  My name is Alicja (Moskaluk) Edwards.  I was born and raised in Poland and now am 77 years old.  For the last 17 years I have been writing a story or rather memoirs of my familys imprisonment in the Soviet Union during World War II,  in Stalins bloody era.  We were forcibly taken from our home in the eastern part of Poland to the Asiatic state of Kazachstan, where we were condemned to slave labor in the year of 1940.  Over the three agonizing years we faced mistreatment and degradation, sickness, hunger and death, till our release from bondage and fight to freedom across the Caspian Sea to Iran, where I met my husband, an American Army lieutenant.  My story was originally meant to answer many questions posed by my family and friends, but somehow the explanation of what happened to me and the other forgotten war victims grew into enlarged vignettes of nonfiction events and history, unknown or forgotten by the rest of the world.  (I say unknown or forgotten because I have yet to hear or read about any of the atrocities inflicted on Polish survivors imprisoned in Soviet Russia during World War II ---- could I be the only one alive?)" />
