  <title>Standing in the Gap - Gladys Blews Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All my life, God, the Father, was standing in the gap created when my biological father gave up his quest to be reconciled with my mother. However, I didnt realize God was there for me until I was almost forty years old. At that time, I discovered a new reality of His presence when cancer invaded our family, a frenzied teenager tried to kill our daughter, Val, our best friend was brutally murdered, and we discovered a psychopath stalking our daughter, Robin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the key to this new reality was starting each day by reading the Bible and making notes about what I thought God was saying to me. Through this process I worked through my rebellion against a God who wanted to start the on-going process of transforming my life into the image of His son, Jesus Christ. He waited patiently for me to open the door of my heart to His Lordship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you entirely satisfied with your life or do you question the reality of you faith in the cruicible of trials? Have you wondered if life is fair or questioned why a loving God would allow pain and suffering? Standing in the Gap  will show you that God the Father is standing at the door of your heart right now. He will never force His way in. My prayer is that this book may empower you to make the most important decision of your life  a decision to open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
