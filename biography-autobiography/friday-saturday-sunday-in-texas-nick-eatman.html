  <title>Friday, Saturday, Sunday in Texas - Nick Eatman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A veteran Texas sports writer offers a lively, up-close look at football in Texas&amp;#8212;the fullest portrait ever conceived&amp;#8212;viewed through the interwoven stories of three teams, Plano Senior High School, Baylor University, and the Dallas Cowboys, during one season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mean one thing: football. Dallas Cowboys&amp;#8217; writer Nick Eatman follows three teams in three leagues throughout the 2015 season blending their stories into a unique, eye-opening chronicle of Lone Star football. Eatman highlights the ups and downs and even the parallels that these teams experienced over the course of the year. Granted unique access to every level of the three teams, and drawing on his invaluable connections, he follows key players and coaches, including stars from Baylor and Plano, Tony Romo, Dez Bryant, Jason Witten, and head coaches Jason Garrett, Art Briles, and Jaydon McCullough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday, Saturday, Sunday in Texas&lt;/em&gt; reveals the inextricable connections between the three teams and the players as the season unfolds. As high school athletes strive to win a spot at colleges like Baylor, college players fight for the chance to go pro, while Cowboys teammates reflect on their rise to the NFL. Though their challenges may differ&amp;#8212;prepping for the SATs or Homecoming, working to get noticed by NFL scouts, or trying to prove themselves for that next contract in the pros&amp;#8212;when the lights come on and they hit the field, they share one goal: to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday, Saturday, Sunday in Texas&lt;/em&gt; features sixteen pages of color photos that capture the highs and lows of the 2015 season. Combining the power of Friday Night Lights and the inspiring insight of &lt;em&gt;Remember the Titans&lt;/em&gt;, it offers a fresh perspective on this beloved sport, and is a must for football fans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
