  <title>Who Left That Table There? - Hanoria M C Baranovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ultimate aim of this book is to try and raise public awareness of VIPs (visually impaired people). And secondly, to raise much-needed funds for the hundreds of blind societies across the United Kingdom. 
The book tells about the trials and tribulations that we VIPs have to contend with in our daily life. 
The book is written from the heart and gives a unique insight to VIPs. The funny things we do, the clangers we drop, gaffes, faux pasyou name it, weve done it!
The book shows how resilient VIPs canor, rather, have todeal with our unfortunate impairment. 
This book was brought about when the author lost her sight and found out just how tough the going was. 
The anecdotes portray the true extent of the problem, stories told from all ages and creeds, telling of their actual stories. 
In this book, you will be given an insight as to how VIPs have to live with fact of becoming invisible and the loneliness brought about by the ignorance of the public. I do not think that the public mean to be like they are, but it is through not having any understanding of our dark world.
We do very well generally, but it could be so much better without the discrimination and third-rate citizens that we are categorised with and the stigma which goes with our visual impairment.
What people think of as a simple task can be a great big problem to VIPs. When you read through this book, I think that it will open peoples eyes and help them appreciate what they have got: sight." />
