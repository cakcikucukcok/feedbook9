  <title>When Tears Turn to Rain - IdnAc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Tears Turn to Rain&lt;/i&gt; tells the personal story of a woman who, at forty, made a vow to herself to give up drinking, to pursue sobriety, and to save her own life. Based upon her journal entries, where she recorded her reflections along the way, she has crafted a sparse, unblinking, and straightforward account of her struggles and achievements along the path to living a sober life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Tears Turn to Rain&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the turn toward living and away from dying that the author made. As she writes, At the age of forty, I realized that my journey was coming to an end. By this time, I was sick and shook so badly that I should have been hospitalized. But still determined to reach my destination of Skid Row, I pedaled all the harder. In December 2012, one block before I reached Skid Row, I noticed a beautiful sign that was lit up with sunshine. Its two words were the most beautiful I had ever seen: Sobriety Place. This is the story of what happens when she heads toward that beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir reveals the details of an individuals journey into sobriety, showing how one woman faced her addiction and changed the direction of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
