      <meta name="description" content="This book tells people about my struggle as a child through my adult years. Im telling my story to encourage parents to talk to their children at an early age about the dangers of the world. Let them know that danger not only lurks outside the home but can be on the inside also. I want parents and children alike to be open with one another so these issues can be better dealt with and not be a burden on the individuals that have endured these horrific actions their whole lives. I want all that read my book to know that, even through the worst times of your life, God is always with us. Knowledge is what will protect your children. Let them know the dangers of the real world and dont sugarcoat real-life situations. Make them feel comfortable telling you any and every thing. You may not be able to prevent certain things from happening, but in doing this, the road to recovery will be much smoother." />
