Based on Bryants diary entries, this memoir captures her coming-of-age experience as a teenage Indian-American girl and tells how her American upbringing and lifestyle choices clashed with her parents traditional Indian cultural views. 
In this narrative, she recalls how the problem began when her parents prepared for her next rite of passage: marriage.

Her fate was sealed when her parents took her with them on an international flight to their ancestral village in India. Bryant shares she didnt want to marry a stranger as tradition dictated. In the end, both parents and daughter are transformed as they reconsider their ties to tradition.
