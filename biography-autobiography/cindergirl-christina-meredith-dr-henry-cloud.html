  <title>CinderGirl - Christina Meredith, Dr. Henry Cloud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing up, she rarely heard her own name. Today, she&#39;s here to help you claim the inherent worth that is yours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into a large working-class family in upstate New York, Christina Meredith endured years of abuse before entering the foster care system as a teenager. With nowhere to turn after she graduated from high school, Christina lived in her car for almost a year, working three jobs to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she prayed in her car every day, Christina had no idea that in just a few years, she would be crowned Ms. California. She had no idea that her suffering would one day help others find healing. But she did know that she was destined for more, and she would not give up hope no matter the circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CinderGirl,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Christina tells her piercing and poignant story of leaving behind homelessness to become Ms. California and the founder of a nonprofit organization that provides advocacy for foster care children. With stunning vulnerability, Christina invites us into her childhood home and the heart of a child longing to be loved. She asks us to journey with her across the country and deep into a growing faith. She invites us to dig deeper into our own personal courage, even in the most grim of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CinderGirl&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is the riveting story of one young woman&#39;s determination to overcome hardship in order to help others know they are not alone and that they too can achieve anything they dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
