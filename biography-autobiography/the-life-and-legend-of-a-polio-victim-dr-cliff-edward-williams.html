  <title>The Life and Legend of a Polio Victim - Dr. Cliff Edward Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Cliff Williams was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. At age eighteen months, he was stricken with polio. He had corrective surgery when he was about five years old. Dr Williams attended St. Francis Elementary and High School, Yazoo City, Mississippi.
	After high school, he had the second surgery on his right foot and later was fitted with a leg brace. The next year he had the third surgery again on the right foot. He kept the faith and attended Mississippi Vocational College, Itta Bena, Mississippi, where he earned the bachelor of science degree in business education. Later, he attended the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, where he earned the masters degree in business education. He also earned the doctorate degree in business education with a cognate area in Organizational Behavior Management at the University of Houston, Houston, Texas. Dr. Williams spent one year in St. Louis, Missouri, and worked as a teletype operator for the Third District Police Department. He returned to Mississippi and taught school at OBannon High School, Greenville, Mississippi, for two years.
	After the last year at OBannon, he accepted a position to teach business subjects at Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi. He was employed there for thirty-five years. During this time, he was married to Ms. Catherine Williams and he is the father of two children.
	Tragedy struck in his life as his brother-in-law was killed, gangland style, in Chicago, Illinois. Another brother-in-law was killed during a robbery, while he was working in a convenience store in Houston, Texas. Later, his auntie died from emphysema, and his father had a fatal heart attack. All of this occurred within a span of two years.
	He had gotten numerous articles published in the Clarion Ledger, a Jackson, Mississippi based newspaper and had published a book. Dr. Williams retired in 1999 and since has served on numerous boards. He also served as vice president of the Mississippi Valley State Alumni Association, Humphreys County chapter and is currently serving as the vice president of the Retired Education Personnel Association, Humphreys County Chapter.
	He has been able to take family vacations to places like Dayton, Ohio, where they visited the Air Force Museum. Noticeably seen there were the airplanes that were used by presidents Roosevelt, Bush Senior, and Bill Clinton. A trip to Cape Canaveral, Florida, resulted in a tour of the National Aeronautic Space Administration (NASA). They went to San Diego and visited other cities such as Lake Elsinore, Alpine, Los Angeles, and Escondido. They stayed at the Lawrence Welk Resort in Escondido, California. While there, they went to Mexico. A trip to Phoenix, Arizona, resulted in a trip to Old Town and the Titan Missel Silo. On a tour they saw George McGoverns home and the home of Paul Harvey. One year, they went to Little Rock, Arkansas, and got a chance to visit the Bill Clinton Library.
	Another noticeable trip was the one to Orlando, Florida. They visited the Believe It Or Not! Museum, Universal Studios, Epcot Center, and Sea World." />
