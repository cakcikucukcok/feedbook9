  <title>Who Is Allah SWT God In Islam Religion? - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some of the biggest misconceptions that many non-Muslims have about Islam have to do with the word &amp;ldquo;Allah.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;For various reasons, many people have come to believe that Muslims worship a different God than Christians and Jews. &amp;nbsp;This is totally false, since &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; is simply the Arabic word for &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; - and there is only One God.&amp;nbsp; Let there be no doubt - Muslims worship the God of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus - peace be upon them all.&amp;nbsp; However, it is certainly true that Jews, Christians and Muslims all have different concepts of Almighty God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, Muslims - like Jews - reject the Christian beliefs of the Trinity and the Divine Incarnation.&amp;nbsp; This, however, does not mean that each of these three religions worships a different God - because, as we have already said, there is only One True God.&amp;nbsp; Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim to be &amp;ldquo;Abrahamic Faiths&amp;rdquo;, and all of them are also classified as &amp;ldquo;monotheistic.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; However, Islam teaches that other religions have, in one way or another, distorted and nullified a pure and proper belief in Almighty God by neglecting His true teachings and mixing them with man-made ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, it is important to note that &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; is the same word that Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews use for God.&amp;nbsp; If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; being used where &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; is used in English.&amp;nbsp; This is because &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; is a word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; with a capital &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; cannot be made plural, a fact which goes hand-in-hand with the Islamic concept of God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is interesting to note that the Aramaic word &amp;ldquo;El&amp;rdquo;, which is the word for God in the language that Jesus spoke, is certainly more similar in sound to the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; than the English word &amp;ldquo;God.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; This also holds true for the various Hebrew words for God, which are &amp;ldquo;El&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Elah&amp;rdquo;, and the plural or glorified form &amp;ldquo;Elohim.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; The reason for these similarities is that Aramaic, Hebrew and Arabic are all Semitic languages with common origins.&amp;nbsp; It should also be noted that in translating the Bible into English, the Hebrew word &amp;ldquo;El&amp;rdquo; is translated variously as &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;angel&amp;rdquo;! &amp;nbsp;This imprecise language allows different translators, based on their preconceived notions, to translate the word to fit their own views.&amp;nbsp; The Arabic word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; presents no such difficulty or ambiguity, since it is only used for Almighty God alone.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, in English, the only difference between &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo;, meaning a false god, and &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo;, meaning the One True God, is the capital &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Due to the above mentioned facts, a more accurate translation of the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; into English might be &amp;ldquo;The One -and-Only God&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The One True God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More importantly, it should also be noted that the Arabic word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; contains a deep religious message due to its root meaning and origin.&amp;nbsp; This is because it stems from the Arabic verb ta&amp;rsquo;allaha (or alaha), which means &amp;ldquo;to be worshipped.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Thus in Arabic, the word &amp;ldquo;Allah&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;The One who deserves all worship.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; This, in a nutshell, is the Pure Monotheistic message of Islam." />
