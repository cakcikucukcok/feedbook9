  <title>Groundhog Day In West Virginia - Mary Feuchtenberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in southern West Virginia in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s was difficult at times, but still a fabulous time for making lifelong friends and memories. Today, downtown Princeton is being revitalized, but has had previous decline with stores closed and jobs lost. There is evidence of drug use with many crimes attributed to those seeking money for drugs. There is much heartache with many families having children or friends with an addiction. God is the answer to those suffering with the pain of addiction and for the loved ones dealing with the ongoing stress and drama of a drug abuser in their life. Prayer and Bible study are the means to healing and peace! Psalm 91:1-2 NIV Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, &quot;He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.&quot;" />
