  <title>Jack of All Trades and Master of None - Robert D., Gregory W. McClinchey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROBERT D. McCLINCHEY&lt;/b&gt; looks back at a long and fruitful life in this memoir, beginning with his birth on the family farm in 1926.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in East Wawanosh Township in Ontario, he found plenty of adventureoften getting into mischief with his six siblings. The family worked together, struggled together and had fun together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an early age, one of the keys to Roberts life was music, which the family enjoyed playing together. Whenever he played the fiddle, he was at peace with himself and others. It also led him to his late wife of 58 years, Frances. In 1950, the two were married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this candid look back at his long life, Robert remembers his varied careers, including fisherman, pool hustler, machinist, mechanic, ice-road trucker, gasoline station attendant, road-builder, snowplow operator, bus driver, farmer and syrup maker. More importantly, he explores what it means to be a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather while being a &lt;i&gt;Jack of All Trades and Master of None&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
