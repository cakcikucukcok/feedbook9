  <title>Perfect Company - Gloria Divine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Glorias life was threatened many times by evildoers but Jesus was always there. She experienced many spiritual and physical difficulties with the production of this book but with the help of Jesus, His Mother and the Saints, she lived to tell the story. Satan and his agents worked hard to prevent this book from being published. However, Jesus was always ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book tells us that God our creator, is very near to us. We are His sacred temples, He hears, sees, and knows everything about us. He is interested in our lives and even more interested in our souls. He will befriend each one of us as He did with Gloria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will appeal to you if you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have loved the Lord all your life and now you want to learn more about His mysteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are an atheist  thinking that God does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are sitting on the fence not knowing which way to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think your life is fulfilled  you do not need God or you put God in His place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are just using God for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are a Priest or Pastor wandering why your congregation is so faithless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are just curious.&lt;/p&gt;" />
