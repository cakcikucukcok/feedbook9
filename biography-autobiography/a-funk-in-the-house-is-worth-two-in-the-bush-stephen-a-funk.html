  <title>A Funk in the House Is Worth Two in the Bush - Stephen A. Funk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The generation before the great baby boomers is the less-known silent generation. They do not get the credit like the boomers, but they did provide the glue and butter to the American system that was needed to hold our American way of life together. They historically document the perspective and view of one Midwestern silent generation and some major events that helped us get to where we are today. 
The story will take you through the small town of El Reno, Oklahoma, to the bustling town of Colorado. In the long attempt to become a national political figure, something more important was found along the way. Humanity and individual accomplishments should be recognized by the least of us. There are numerous stories that the silent generation has, and it is important to spend as much time with your older family members to uncover the wisdom of their time. Also if you have any interest in Colorado philanthropy, this book might interest you. 
This is the biography of my father, William Lewis Funk, otherwise known as the man behind the twenty-five-year Colorado Funk award for Building Community in Colorado. Dad has lived quite an eventful life from living in a Frank Lloyd Wright house to partying with the Lambda Chis at Oklahoma to becoming a JAG attorney to meeting and working with many historical figures from presidents and senators to the very well-respected wartime Japanese hero Minoru Yasi as well as other prominent leaders in Colorado." />
