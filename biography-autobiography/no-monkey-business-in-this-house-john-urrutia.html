During their journey from Carrara, Tuscany (Italy), to Corsica (France), Puerto Rico, and eventually to the United States, they had seen and experienced the full range of human experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they build a new life for their children and their childrens children, the family creates the roots of a hard-earned family fortune in Puerto Rico coffee plantationsonly to lose it.

As some of the older generation crumbles under the stresses of life in a new world, their children find joy and comfort in the rich soil of American opportunity and possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But through it all, one thing remained a constant: the love of family. In this detailed, narrative family history, author John Urrutias novel style invites you into the many challenges and triumphs of family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
