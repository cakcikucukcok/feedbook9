  <title>An Elsewhere Place - Malay Kumar Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the early 1950s to the early &amp;rsquo;60s, Malay Kumar Roy spent around ten years as a young boy in Hazaribagh in the Chhotanagpur district of Jharkhand, which was then a part of Bihar. In &lt;em&gt;An Elsewhere Place&lt;/em&gt;, Roy reminisces about his life there&amp;mdash;a place that &amp;lsquo;touches a boy forever&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, he vividly describes Hazaribagh&amp;rsquo;s tranquil landscape, its changing seasons and its unhurried pace of life. We get a glimpse of a time gone by from Roy&amp;rsquo;s stories about sharing a crate of mangoes with the last Englishman living in Hazaribagh; a little bear cub tipsy on mahua flowers; a gravely injured fox cub that was nursed back to health by him and his family, and a visitor from Calcutta who boasted about his detective skills and courage but lost steam upon seeing a dangerous criminal. And he revisits his schooldays at St Xavier&amp;rsquo;s School where his Jesuit mentors taught him the value of curiosity and discipline in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in charming, spare prose, this collection evokes a gentle, easy-going time when man and nature existed in harmony; a time of friendships, wonder and grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
