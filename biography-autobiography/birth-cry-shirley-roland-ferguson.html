  <title>Birth Cry - Shirley Roland Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As someone grows up in what many might consider less than ideal conditions, it can be difficult to envision a successful life. One might dream about being an inspiration to others, but it seems to be only thata dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, however, have their dreams fulfilled. In Birth Cry: A Personal Story of the Life of Hannah D. Mitchell, Nurse Midwife, Hannah Mitchell exposes her heart in this true story that spans a lifetime of over eighty years. She shows how her strong Christian upbringing and conversion helped her deal with a wayward brother, get an education and establish a successful career, make marriage plans, face heartbreak and devastating health issues, move from familiar places, and experience new situations. All these life-altering events were contrary to her plans and things we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told with the help of Shirley Roland Ferguson, Birth Cry: A Personal Story of the Life of Hannah D. Mitchell, Nurse Midwife is the story of a successful and inspirational woman. It is a book everyone, especially women, should read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
