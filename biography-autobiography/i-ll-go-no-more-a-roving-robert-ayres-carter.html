  <title>I’Ll Go No More A-Roving - Robert Ayres Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for Somewhere I Have Never Traveled
Th is fourth volume of Robert Ayres Carters autobiography takes the reader
back to the 1970s. From the outside, Carters life seems conventional: he was an
executive in the world of publishing and advertising, commuting between Long
Island and Manhattan. Setting this work apart from the ordinariness of that sort
of life is the clarity of his unfl inching revelation of his private aff airs, emotions,
and thoughts. His struggles to become a writer of novels, his self-doubts, and his
emotional and physical involvement with many women, and the collapse of two
marriages are all described vividly with the skill of the accomplished novelist.
Perhaps most poignant of all are his descriptions of his sense of loss from his
separation from his two sons.
