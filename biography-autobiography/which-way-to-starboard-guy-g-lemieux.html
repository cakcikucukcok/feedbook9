  <title>Which Way to Starboard? - Guy G. Lemieux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At one point after the boom vang broke loose, the boom and the sail shifted to a higher position. I didnt like the loss of control this caused. The boat was swinging from 0 to 20 degrees in jerky motions, lifting and heeling. The boom vang had been ripped out of its housing. I had an idea what to do and told Roxanne what I had in mind. At a certain moment, with her help holding up the boom vang in a certain way, I would let go of the rudder and lunge forward to grab the creature from her hand and plunge its little head into the second available hole, a slot just under the boom. This she understood, but all the while I was under great stress, anxious for my daughters life and mine. 
The wind was quite strong and I didnt want the boat to flip over  not there, away from any available help. We were two miles from shore in any direction. I checked the waves and wind and then turned the boat into the wind. On my signal to Roxanne, I lurched forward and grabbed the beastly creature and shakily shoved its head in the hole. I then turned the boat back to windward and pulled in on the sheet that pulled the boom back to its correct position. Everything was fine again. In a plastic bag hanging from the boom near the mast were my cigarettes and a lighter. Thats where Roxanne was also handy. She passed me a cigarette and my lighter and I lit it and took a big drag. Ah The rest of the day went beautifully. In the same bag we had a nice light lunch (gourmet style), a couple of baloney sandwiches, and two cans of pop." />
