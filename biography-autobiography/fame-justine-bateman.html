  <title>Fame - Justine Bateman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Justine Bateman was famous before selfies replaced autographs, and bags of fan mail gave way to Twitter shitstorms. And here&#39;s the good news: she took notes along the way. Justine steps through the looking glass of her own celebrity, shatters it, and pieces together, beyond the shards and splinters, a reflection of her true self. The transformation is breathtaking. Revelatory and raucous, fascinating and frightening, &lt;i&gt;Fame&lt;/i&gt; is a hell of a ride.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Michael J. Fox,&lt;/b&gt; actor, author of &lt;i&gt;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&#39;ve ever dreamed of being famous someday, you need to read this book. If you&#39;ve ever called a celebrity, a &#39;has-been&#39; or a &#39;flash in the pan&#39; on social media, then you really need to read this book. Justine Bateman has crafted the most compelling and comprehensive treatise on the nature of fame that you&#39;re ever likely to read. Through a fearless act of self-examination, which she conducts with the scientific detachment of an anthropologist, Bateman illuminates both the short- and long-term effects of attempting to navigate the labyrinth of celebrity.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Ernest Cline,&lt;/b&gt; author of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Justine Bateman, in a voice both empathetic and take-no-prisoners, has produced a fascinating look at the psychology of present-day Fame. She traces its roots down to humble beginnings in the injured psyche of every human, hoping to find a cure for what ails us all. In these early, heady days of the ascension of social media, in which everyone seems able to fulfill the Warholian dictum of fifteen minutes, Bateman casts a sober, never overly serious eye on today&#39;s media landscape and emerges without cynicism on the hard-won side of love and acceptance.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;b&gt;David Duchovny,&lt;/b&gt; actor, author of &lt;i&gt;Bucky F*cking Dent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought my ideas about fame were intractable until Justine Bateman took them apart with her relentlessly truthful and engrossing investigation. She mines the subject with bracing honesty, and by including herself in the whole experiment she makes it hard for the reader to avoid examining their own ego, their own social agenda. Justine&#39;s voice is fresh: she throws down with a free-associating slam that you won&#39;t expect but can identify with, and the searching and sometimes profane rant that accompanies each idea is one you can&#39;t help but trust. She distills it all into the questions: Why do we value this person over that one? And why do we ultimately resent the ones we overvalue? An honest and imminently quotable rumination by a qualified and intellectually formidable source.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Mary-Louise Parker,&lt;/b&gt; actress, author of &lt;i&gt;Dear Mr. You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A smart, unflinching, touching, riveting, one-of-a-kind hybrid of memoir and cultural analysis. Fame in its contemporary form is strange and powerful and deeply American; so is &lt;i&gt;Fame.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Kurt Andersen,&lt;/b&gt; author of &lt;i&gt;Fantasyland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment shows, magazines, websites, and other channels continuously report the latest sightings, heartbreaks, and triumphs of the famous to a seemingly insatiable public. Millions of people go to enormous lengths to achieve Fame. Fame is woven into our lives in ways that may have been unimaginable in years past.&lt;p&gt;And yet, is Fame even real? Contrary to tangible realities, Fame is one of those &quot;realities&quot; that we, as a society, have made. Why? What is it about Fame that drives us to spend so much time, money, and focus to create the framework that maintains its health?&lt;p&gt;Mining decades of experience, writer, director, producer, and actress Justine Bateman writes a visceral, intimate look at the experience of Fame. Combining the internal reality-shift of the famous, theories on the public&#39;s behavior at each stage of a famous person&#39;s career, and the experiences of other famous performers, Bateman takes the reader inside and outside the emotions of Fame. The book includes twenty-four color photographs to highlight her analysis.&lt;/div&gt;" />
