  <title>After the Violence - Ellen Zelda Kessner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A young family-dad, mom, baby-are gunned down in their home by a &quot;friend.&quot; Dad and baby survive, but the mom does not. Her mom searches for the truth of her daughter&#39;s life and murder, while desperately trying to bond with her wounded grandchild. This memoir is both mystery (diamonds, threats, betrayal) and love story: one woman&#39;s deliberate re-incarnation of her daughter for her grandchild who would never know her mom.&lt;p&gt;
From the Reviews of  &lt;i&gt;SAVING BEAUTY FROM THE BEAST&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Who can better understand the rage that erupts and the pain that perseveres in the aftermath of murder than a mother who lost her daughter to male violence?   A brave and compassionate account.&lt;p&gt;		
-Dominick Dunne&lt;p&gt;
&quot;  an excellent guide   as well as a memoir from the heart.  Saving Beauty   is both heart-wrenching and healing. Highly recommended.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
-Library Journal, 2003&lt;p&gt;
Advance Praise for &lt;i&gt;AFTER THE VIOLENCE&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;p&gt;
 &quot;This mom&#39;s affecting portrait of her long-gone daughter relates the emotional devastation that murder inflicts on an entire family through the generations. Incredibly moving in its honesty and inspiration.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
