  <title>From Happiness to Tragedy; to Bliss on the Borderline - Nicholas E. Cleveland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bewildered, she exclaimed, Did she have psychological problems?  I was stunned.  I had just told my real estate agent I was selling my house because my wife left me nine months ago.    
A few years ago, we bought a house in the Akron area.  My wife rode around town with this real estate agent looking for a home.  When I told the agent she had left me, the she said, She talked you up so well, I honestly believed she thought you were a god!  I replied, I used to be, but now Im a demon from Hades.  Neither me or my wife had spoken to this agent before or since she sold us our house.
Thats just a small sample of the paradox I had lived the previous twelve years.  My first wife died, suddenly, leaving me alone with our seven year old boy.  A year later, I married my second wife.  Now, my second period of grieving was to begin.  
Through the course of the following pages you will cruise along the path of a man who laments the loss of his first wife and tries to make sense of life in general.  Suddenly however, in the midst of the book, his present wife leaves him.  This devastation twists the book into a peculiar direction as he expresses his grief in the loss of his second wife, then in Part III, tells his story of the agonies involved in living with a Borderline wife.  In Part IV, the book produces evidence that convinces him she has Borderline Personality Disorder, then elaborates further on how it affected him and his son.  Finally, in Part V, as an afterthought, he discusses the fact that he may be narcissistic after all and this narcissism may have drawn him to his BPD wife and helps explain how they stayed together for so long." />
