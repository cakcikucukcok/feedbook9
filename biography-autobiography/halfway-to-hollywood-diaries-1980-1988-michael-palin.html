  <title>Halfway to Hollywood: Diaries 1980--1988 - Michael Palin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; Best Nonfiction of 2011 title &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second volume of Michael Palin&#39;s diaries covers the bulk of the 1980s, a decade in which the ties binding the Pythons loosened--they made their last film &lt;i&gt;Monty Pyton&#39;s Meaning of Life&lt;/i&gt; in 1983. For Michael, writing and acting took over much of his life, culminating in his appearances in &lt;i&gt;A Fish Called Wanda&lt;/i&gt;, in which he played the hapless, stuttering Ken, and won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;i&gt;Halfway to Hollywood&lt;/i&gt; follows Palin&#39;s torturous trail through seven movies and ends with his final preparations for the documentary that was to change his life--&lt;i&gt;Around the World in 80 Days&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;During these years he co-wrote and acted in Terry Gilliam&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Time Bandits&lt;/i&gt; as well as spearing in Gilliam&#39;s follow-up success &lt;i&gt;Brazil&lt;/i&gt;. Palin co-produced, wrote and played the lead in &lt;i&gt;The Missionary&lt;/i&gt; opposite Maggie Smith, who also appeared with him in &lt;i&gt;A Private Function&lt;/i&gt;, written by Alan Bennett. In television the decade was memorable &lt;i&gt;for East of Ipswich&lt;/i&gt;, inspired his links with Suffolk. Such was his fame in the US, he was enticed into once again hosting the enormously popular show &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;. He filmed one of the BBC&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Great Railway Journeys&lt;/i&gt; as well as becoming chairman of the pressure group Transport 2000. His life with Helen and the family remains a constant, as the children enter their teens.&lt;br&gt;Palin&#39;s joy of writing is evident once more in &lt;i&gt;Halfway to Hollywood&lt;/i&gt; as he demonstrates his continuing sense of wonder at the world in which he finds himself. A world of screens large and small.&lt;/p&gt;" />
