  <title>Twist and Shout: An Awkward Life with Tourette&#39;s - Tyler Oberheu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning with a disease you knew nothing about. You panic. Your family panics. Your friends wonder what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. You become known as The Sick Kid at school, and your whole life changes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine losing control of your body. You twitch and shout and are labeled a &amp;ldquo;nuisance&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;freak.&amp;rdquo; You try a bunch of wacky remedies and advice from quack doctors. You drown yourself in drugs and alcohol because it&amp;rsquo;s an escape. And one day you try to give up on everything, including life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I promise this book isn&amp;rsquo;t as depressing as it sounds. In fact, it can be funny sometimes (if you have a warped sense of humor). Read what it&amp;rsquo;s like to wake up with Tourette&amp;rsquo;s syndrome one day. Learn what it&amp;rsquo;s like to try pseudoscience when doctors give you answers you don&amp;rsquo;t like. Learn what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a generally bad kid and then growing up and realizing how dumb you were. Join me and three other brave souls who have tried to get by for so long, and learn what it&amp;rsquo;s like to think of yourself as broken&amp;mdash;when all along you were better than you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
