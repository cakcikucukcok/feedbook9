      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hilarious and biting memoir from the actor, comedian and&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;alumni David Spade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Spade is best known for his harsh &amp;#8220;Hollywood&amp;#8221; Minute Sketches on&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;, his starring roles in movies like&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Joe Dirt&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Tommy Boy&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#160;and his seven-year stint as Dennis Finch on the series&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Just Shoot Me.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Now, with a wit as dry as the weather in his home state of Arizona, the &amp;#8220;comic brat extraordinaire&amp;#8221; tells his story in&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Almost Interesting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Taking fans back to his childhood as a wannabe cool younger brother and recounting his excruciating road-tour to fame&amp;#8212;when he was regularly mistaken for a ten year-old, Spade then dishes about his time crisscrossing the country as a comedian, for low-paying gigs and dragging along his mother&amp;#8217;s old suitcase full of props. He also covers his years on&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;during the beloved Rock/Sandler/Farley era of the 1990s, including his&amp;#160;close working relationship and friendship with Chris Farley&amp;#160;and brags about the ridiculous perks that fame has brought into his life, including the constant fear of being fired,&amp;#160;a crazy ex-assistant who attacked him while he was sleeping, a run-in with Eddie Murphy on the mean streets of Beverly Hills, and of course an endless supply of hot chicks. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes dirty, always funny, and as sharp as a tack,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Almost Interesting&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;reminds you why David Spade is one of our generation&amp;#8217;s favorite funny guys.&lt;/p&gt;" />
