  <title>The Wog’S Diary - Dinos the Greek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On Fathers Day, I hadnt received any calls from my kids. As I lay on the couch, my whole life flashed before me, remembering I left Greece as a young boy working on a ship as a captain cadet. I jumped ship in Australia and became an illegal immigrant. I write about my first job, first affair, going to Sydney, and my first job at the Sydney Water Board, highlighting the corruption. I also write about the job I got at Julia Creek and how the company went broke and the odyssey of four days trying to reach Sydney with no money. I talk about the job I had at Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme, highlighting the illegal gambling; the job I had at the CDW in Sydney; and my painting career. I write about the Australian culture and drinking at pubs every lunch time. I write about meeting my first wife and having two children and an unsuccessful marriage. I had a lot of affairs, and I did like the nightlife. The economy slowed down, and I started working at Ansett in the scullery section. I also talk about being a union delegate of the LTU (John Morris was the then secretary and labor senator). There was a lot of controversy, and I had to change sections after pressure from Ansett. I feared for my life, and I was forced to leave the company. I write about the seventies and eighties and the nightlife, entertainment, discos, bars, and piano bars, including the best of them allJulianas at the Hilton Hotel, the Americas Cup Bar, and the Centerpoint Piano Bar. I write about how I experienced the nightlife and the affairs. In other words, I did it my way. I write about divorcing my first wife; how I met my second wife, who also bore me two children; and the death of my wife at age forty-five." />
