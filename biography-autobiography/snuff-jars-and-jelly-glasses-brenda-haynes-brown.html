  <title>Snuff Jars and Jelly Glasses - Brenda Haynes Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From her thought-provoking All of Mississippi, Aint Mississippi, Brown appears to be up to snuff in coming out and saying whats on her mind. Her adept knowledge of the South and its history lends her a crown of credibility for the literature of reality that says, She just could not have made this stuff up!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snuff Jars and Jelly Glasses, a rich blend of narrative, flows with contemplative musings, reflective poetry, and amusing memoirs.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With twinkles of her Southern charm and unique depictions of her beloved Mississippi, Brown delivers a superb, inspirational read, cleverly interlaced with comedy, tragedy, drama, and history of actual journeys and encounters with family and the local pioneers of Mississippis historic Sunflower Plantation, a place she knows like no other.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown unfolds her anecdotes with crackerjack humor, yet with outspoken affection, even admiration, for those of a more simple mindset who are forever spouting uncanny fonts of profound wisdom with childlike simplicityby simply stating the obvious.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Penned from an intuitive over-the-shoulder glance, she enchantingly lures us with hysterical and poignant perceptions that apply to all humanity seeking love, community, friendship, and freedom.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown incites us to think about the past as we are reminded, again and again, that the issues of our past are indelibly inscribed on our present.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snuff Jars and Jelly Glasses strives to anchor usas elapsing time draws us backward, toward homein simple collections that can be devoured in one sitting, or nibbled in bits to make it last a while.&lt;/p&gt;" />
