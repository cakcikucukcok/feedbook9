  <title>Beauty for Ashes - Georgia Tate Dishroon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;Beauty For Ashes&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Born in 1923, in a small coal mining town in east Tennessee, Georgia Tate Dishroon quickly learned through lifes exacting lessons that depending on God is the only way to find true peace and happiness. The Great Depression and WWII dramatically changed her life and the lives of those she deeply loved, but strong family ties and a determined faith in Gods grace became the foundation that helped her overcome adversity and enjoy a victorious life. In this captivating account of her life, Georgia shares many poignant moments and moving stories that confirm her belief that the Lord gave her beauty for ashes...that &lt;i&gt;He might be glorified.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Isaiah 61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that &lt;i&gt;He might be glorified&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
