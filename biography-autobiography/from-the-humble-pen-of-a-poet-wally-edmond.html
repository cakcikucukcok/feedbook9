  <title>From the Humble Pen of a Poet - Wally Edmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To interpret poetry is then to lose the entity of poetry itself. A simple poem that may find one reader simply laughing at its rhyme, just might yet lead another to be found simply wondering what the true intention of that verse was.&lt;br&gt;
Simply put  It just might not have one in the first place!&lt;br&gt;
A rhyme and reason? Well, this book of poetry is literally &#39;jam-packed&#39; full of them both.&lt;br&gt;
So get ready to sit back comfortably in your favorite chair, treat yourself to a nice hot cup of coffee or tea, and before long you will soon begin to find out the reason why you&#39;re taking your valuable time to read this collection of verses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are a wide variety of tasteful poems throughout this book, but in a sense they were designed to enlighten the reader&#39;s taste buds, in the desire that they will truly savor the heartfelt intention that this book of poetry was written for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wally Edmond&#39;s prolific style of poetry had been featured for over twenty years through the late Bob Stalder&#39;s poetry column &quot;Poet&#39;s Pen,&quot; which was published in the &lt;i&gt;Beatrice Daily Sun&lt;/i&gt;, a Nebraskan newspaper.&lt;br&gt;
He and his family live in the rural town of Wymore Nebraska, where he enjoys writing his featured column &quot;Artistically Arbor&quot; for the &lt;i&gt;Wymore Arbor State&lt;/i&gt;, a local weekly newspaper. The column is mixed with Wally&#39;s, poetry, quotations, and short stories." />
