  <title>Emerging from the Matrix - Salini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love always wins in the end darling daughter. Bless this beautiful book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Mother Ammachi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a must-read for anyone with chronic illness and a history of trauma. Salinis heart-felt words and sharing of her long and difficult journey gives us all hope and truth that we can all heal from trauma, no matter how severe, with the inclusion of positive thought and knowledge of higher forces leading us on truly spiritual paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Beilin, O.M.D., L. Ac. Aptos, California, Doctor of Integrative Medicine, Lecturer in Regulation Thermography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a true chronicle of powerful lessons learned at the hands of dark power while tempered by the forces of light. Salini is a secret society daughter born into a dark, global organization of domination, hatred and violence, yet through her mother she is also the heir to a powerful legacy of female healers and shamans hailing from a long lineage of love, light and awakening. Salini was forced to reconcile the two together to prevail, alchemically bringing forth a great healing power to alleviate humanitys suffering. These are the lessons she learned both as a sex slave and as an initiate into love and healing. This is who she became in dying and resurrecting herself. And this is the healing she offers for those still in bondage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
