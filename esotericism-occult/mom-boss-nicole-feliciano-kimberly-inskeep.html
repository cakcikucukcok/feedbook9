&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Entrepreneurial Mom:&lt;/b&gt; Learn how to be a super mom and a great business woman in a  step-by-step guide to developing, incubating, and marketing your business without taking the joy out of family life with kids—being an active parent while being an active business entrepreneur.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Badass Business Woman:&lt;/b&gt; Where Sophia Amoruso’s &lt;i&gt;#GirlBoss&lt;/i&gt; left off for young millennials breaking into the business world, &lt;i&gt;Mom Boss&lt;/i&gt; picks up and continues the mission for all the entrepreneurial moms out there.  &lt;i&gt;Mom Boss&lt;/i&gt; proves that being successful isn’t about degrees or sacrifices, it’s about balance and power. It’s where instinct meets intelligence. Every mom has it in her to be a badass business woman. Nicole Feliciano charts the course for building a successful career without sacrificing being a great mom.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mom Boss:&lt;i/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  The first book by Nicole Feliciano the Founder &amp; CEO of &lt;i&gt;Momtrends Media&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Momtrends Media&lt;/i&gt; provides busy women with a daily dose of style. Each day Nicole and her team of editors, interpret trends for moms, keeping in mind that modern women want to look and feel great, but they are working with less time and less energy than they had before the kids came along. Nicole and her team are there to help and inspire women to look and feel their best. Social media is her playground, and she&#39;s built a loyal following by making fashion fun and accessible.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Successful Business Woman:&lt;/b&gt; Before launching &lt;i&gt;Momtrends Media&lt;/i&gt;, Nicole graduated from Vanderbilt University with a degree in English Literature, and spent a decade working in fashion -- most notably as an executive with Polo Ralph Lauren. When she became a mom in 2005, the business woman and fashion maven embarked on her social media career and began contributing to Babble.com, Time Out New York Kids, and many more online publications. Seeing a void in the blogosphere, she launched Momtrends.com in 2007. Momtrends continues to be the cornerstone of her media empire.
