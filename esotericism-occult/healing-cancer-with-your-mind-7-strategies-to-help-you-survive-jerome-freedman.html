Originally thinking I would only stay a few minutes for the event, I not only stayed the whole time, but learned so much from Jerome and the 7 strategies.Jerome is such an amazing person who has contributed so much and the mindfulness meditation sessions during the event and discussion amongst the attendees was dynamic to say the least. I believe Jerome&amp;rsquo;s testimony and book gives people power. Power that they can overcome the biggest of odds.Power that there are alternatives to just chemotherapy.. &lt;strong&gt;--Immanuel Lewis,&lt;/strong&gt; an elite holistic and naturopathic nutritionist practicing in Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;" />
