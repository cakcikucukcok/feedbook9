  <title>A Year and a Day - Michaela Mills, Elixir Edits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cass expected the one year anniversary of Johnny&amp;#39;s death would be hard; at least as hard as her attempts have been to move on in life without her husband. She didn&amp;#39;t expect to be haunted by him, seeing him everywhere. The more she fights these images, the stronger they become, until something must give... her sanity or her faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to move on, she must confront her past. In order to confront her past, she must accept her future. Her past and future will collide, leaving either devastation or awakening in its wake. The choice is hers: return to the Path she&amp;#39;d left behind all those years ago; or forge her own future, regardless of the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This debut novel from Michaela Mills tackles the subject of grief after the loss of a spouse, finding love again, and allowing oneself to face both the past and the future head-on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
