For He said that first the earthy then the spiritual (John 3:6flesh then spirit). It will take the reader from the first Adam as spirit through the fall and into Gods restoration through Christs finished work of the cross and on to His ascension. To the revelation of Himself given to His called out Apostle Paul who became our pattern of this life. He also said, He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying. Oftentimes, this is heard through what we can call the dark night of faith because when we have faith, we no longer walk by sight alone but rather as Abraham did by taking God at His Word or just trusting Him." />
