  <title>Memories Time Allow - Yoseph T. Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost every short ditty confined within this book has arrived to me through my dreaming stages. All of the people are simply figments of my dreaming imagination. They are indeed fiction yet while dreaming through them they took on an almost non-fiction realm. Cold sweats and at times racing heart beats were my companions throughout my awakening. Some left me with a sense of actually knowing who they were. On all occasions I dreamt of them only once then they returned to wherever it was they emanated from. What controlled my dreaming I may never understand? Only a few times did the dream stop one morning only to continue the following night while I slept. It was a kind of a too be continued later type scenario. While I began to dream at the exact same spot I left the previous night I became a little confused. It was if their story simply was not over until they thought it was. I understand that probably sounds a little psychotic but that&#39;s how it came down. I virtually had no control over it so I reasoned out nothing and simply dreamt. 
          Many stories have a haunting underlying sequence of death. I know not why except for that all the people seemed to be coming back from somewhere. A sense came to me of a graveyard of which is now their permanent residence. None of them argued on my death assumption as they never really talked to me anyway. They showed me what they had to say. As with all dreams I was merely observing. Few life forms within my dreams were angry but many seemed frustrated! They would consult among themselves and at times look at me. It&#39;s very difficult to say they were looking at me for I was in the dream as my own sight. It&#39;s not hard to imagine seeing through a dream because we&#39;ve all done it. Seeing is what we do in dreams and on rare occasions some people say that they have actually seen themselves. I have never seen myself in any dream yet I exist within the dream as merely sight. Kind of like: life without a mirror to reflect myself upon. Anyway, other short pages are simply word interpretations and fragments of assumptions. I simply picked then dissected words for my own personal amusement. However, at times other people within my dreams would offer their opinions relative to what I was writing. Some of these folks in my dreams didn&#39;t stick around that long, only a few seconds. A hit and run deal best describes them. These people would blatantly talk out loud for no apparent reason yet what they said made me discover some writing perspectives I never understood before. Most times what was said conveyed nicely onto the page I was writing. Again I did not argue with the flow of what we accomplished. I have to mention them for without their help I wouldn&#39;t have had much to write about.
          A few of the pages are dedicated to soldiers. Unfortunately the world still needs required army&#39;s. Actually the world would do rather nicely without them for it is we who not the world in need of battle. Three mentioned stories are about soldiers and unfortunately they are not stories on a female soldier. The soldiers are men within the book. One came from a very seemingly long dream and two came from partial dreaming. I&#39;ll let you decide which is which. Soldiers and death are long acquaintances that only time can control. Actually timing and a soldiers&#39; death are one in the same. For whatever reason the death undertones arrived on my pages it became written equally as easy. I shall never understand death as I feel we never really die anyway. We&#39;re just simply removed.
          Many other pages reflect upon our human condition. We all go through the same feelings or emotions so I figured I would collect some basic categories and dissect the word. I feel it broke up the pages as to inflict conclusions yet keep my personal feelings at bay. This is by no means a self help book! We as a species have possibly uncountable help books at our disposal. Fine by me but little knowledge can be obtained if" />
