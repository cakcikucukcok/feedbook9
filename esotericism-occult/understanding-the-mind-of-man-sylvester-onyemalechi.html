  <title>Understanding the Mind of Man - Sylvester Onyemalechi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The life of a man is built around his thoughts. Your thoughts determine your experiences in life. You cant live above your thoughts. Your thoughts determine your self-image, self-worth, and status in life. Inferiority complexes, superiority complexes, pride, arrogance, and timidity are all products of self-analysis. What you think of yourself determines how you carry yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success in every area of life is determined by the use of the mind. The purpose of this guide is not to teach how to be led by the mind. Instead, it reveals much about the nature of the mind; the domineering and controlling power of the thoughts that go through our minds; the ways in which the thoughts we think affect the way we speak, feel, act and behave; and ways to renew and bring it under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will learn&lt;/p&gt;
the power of the mind of man;
the nature of the mind;
the power of positive thinking;
the power of god consciousness;
the winning attitude;
the role of the mind in managing problems;
how to overcome lust and immoral behavior;
how to maintain peace; and
how to deal with evil thoughts." />
