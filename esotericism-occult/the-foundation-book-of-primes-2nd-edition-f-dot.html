  <title>The Foundation Book of Primes - 2Nd Edition - F. Dot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written Now 
This book is being written now so that when major earth changes occur, this handbook will allow order to quickly be established. Relying on arcane institutions will extend harsh pain and suffering. This is unnecessary. We have the capability to provide caring and humane treatment towards each other. Do not be fooled when others make the claim that the current belief systems are the only ones. Dare to choose a more all-encompassing one. 
Blueprint for Development 
This book is provided as a blue print for an optimum environment for advancing entity pools development. One of the purposes is to describe a framework for all sentients to be included, if the will be there. The framework is one of inclusion and not to be limited to a small percent of the society pool. Are you up to it?
