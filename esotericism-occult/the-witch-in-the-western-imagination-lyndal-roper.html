  <title>The Witch in the Western Imagination - Lyndal Roper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an exciting new approach to witchcraft studies, &lt;i&gt;The Witch in     the Western Imagination&lt;/i&gt; examines the visual representation of witches in early modern     Europe. With vibrant and lucid prose, Lyndal Roper moves away from the typical witchcraft     studies on trials, beliefs, and communal dynamics and instead considers the witch as a symbolic     and malleable figure through a broad sweep of topics and time     periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employing a wide selection of archival, literary, and visual     materials, Roper presents a series of thematic studies that range from the role of emotions in     Renaissance culture to demonology as entertainment, and from witchcraft as female embodiment to     the clash of cultures on the brink of the Enlightenment. Rather than providing a vast synthesis     or survey, this book is questioning and exploratory in nature and illuminates our understanding     of the mental and psychic worlds of people in premodern     Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roper&#39;s spectrum of theoretical interests     will engage readers interested in cultural history, psychoanalytic theory, feminist theory, art     history, and early modern European studies. These essays, three of which appear here for the     first time in print, are complemented by more than forty images, from iconic paintings to     marginal drawings on murals or picture frames. In her unique focus on the imagery of witchcraft,     Lyndal Roper has succeeded in adding a compelling new dimension to the study of witchcraft in     early modern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
