  <title>Relationshifting: Tools for Living Quantum Resplendency - Dr. Angela Longo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Our lives are supposed to be resplendent, radiant, and glorious. Instead, what most of us experience is a life filled with struggle, conflict, and illness. Relationshifting creates a bridge to a new life based upon Dr. Angela Longos more than forty years of clinical experience. Dr. Longo offers an overview of the eight bottom lines, which she defines as the eight major ways in which we block the flow of positive energy into our lives. She explains how to shift that energy to resplendent living by relationshifting through quantum resplendencya quantum way of living.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Relationshifting workbook includes explanations and exercises using the following tools:&lt;/P&gt;
Heartwaving is an easy-to-use technique used to shift old, unproductive patterns to resplendency.&lt;/br&gt;
Bathwaves are Longos self-created energy patterns based upon her beliefs, attitudes, thoughts, habits, words, actions, values, and emotions.&lt;/br&gt;
Love Letters are messages she sends to herself to guide her to living resplendency.&lt;/br&gt;
Triunity shows her she is actually three beings in onepromoting understanding of her larger persona.&lt;/br&gt;
Eternalbeing indicates the larger, unique purpose of her life.&lt;/br&gt;
Muscle testing helps to assess her perceptions and patterns.&lt;/br&gt;
Shifting the Eight Bottom Lines, the eight judgments that keep her from changing her Bathwaves to living resplendency.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Relationshifting demonstrates the fact that when you are living in the resplendent way, life is EEEZYan eternal, emergent, entanglement as a zestful you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
