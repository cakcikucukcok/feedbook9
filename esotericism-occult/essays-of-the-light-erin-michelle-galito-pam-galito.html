  <title>Essays of the Light - Erin Michelle Galito, Pam Galito</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You were never meant to remain ignorant to the presence of God, nor to the energy within you that is God. You were never meant to experience struggle, pain, or anything like this. Instead, you were meant to live a life filled with well-being, joy, and love.
We are here to assist in the awakening of all people to the awareness of God within all. The time is now to wake up, for what is coming is much greater than has been previously allowed or believed. It is happening. It is a culmination of Gods will, as well as that of humans, for the asking of this to occur has been going on for so long. God hears this, and so it is time. Somewhere within all humans there is a knowing that it is time for the total awakening.
~ The Ascended Masters and the Archangels
