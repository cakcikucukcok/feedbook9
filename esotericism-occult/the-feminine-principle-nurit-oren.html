  <title>THE FEMININE PRINCIPLE - Nurit Oren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide for men and women on using the feminine-like nature we all have for the final stages of awakening. Nurit has a way of bringing the reader into the depth of what she herself has realized. She offers insights into her own journey of discovery to provide guidance for seekers that are trapped in the repetitious cycle of the Mind and who wish to transcend to a new level of being. She also includes excepts from the Satsangs, lectures and interviews of Hungarian Master of Silence, Gabor Harsanyi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book offers wisdom of the sort that comes out of real life experience, demonstrating that understanding is available to us at whatever level one is willing to take it in. It gets into the nitty-gritty of accessing the feminine principle, and clearly points out how imperative it is to activate this principle if we wish to reach our full potential and awaken on a personal as well as global level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we find a delightful balance of all the ingredients that make for a good read, including the lighter side. At the same time, the reader is halted, spellbound, wishing to savor a certain passage that conveys and contains rich texture, nuance, and depth to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Through her writing, Nurit has a way of bringing the reader into the depth of what she herself has realized. Everything is fair game, and no topic is too taboo for her to pick apart or dive into. She is sincere almost to a fault, and her humor and honest self-assessment makes for a romping good read.&amp;nbsp; While carrying the reader along a river in a sort of merry way, the book offers wisdom of the sort that comes out of real life experience, demonstrating that understanding is available to us at whatever level one is willing to take it in. This is the gift of Nurit&amp;rsquo;s writing. From what I can tell, it is an intrinsic part of who she is: open, honest, wise, full of heart and at times just plain frankly funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Both Nurit and her husband, Gabor, are dedicated to assisting the sincere reader in the return Home. This is where we all meet in Truth, where individuality opens up to a larger connected whole where pure possibility lives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susanne Marie, Spiritual Mentor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By stepping back from Mind, and sinking into one&amp;rsquo;s body, and going within, one can break the stranglehold Mind has on us and we can allow ourselves to experience life on a new level. Nurit offers insights into her own journey of discovery to provide guidance for seekers that are trapped in the repetitious cycle of the Mind and who wish to transcend to a new level of being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stefan Verstappen, Author of A Masters Guide to The Way of the Warrior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Few Chapter Titles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Guided Practice of Going Within &amp;amp; Re-proportioning the Attention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mind, Butt Out if You Know What&amp;rsquo;s Good for Me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frank Sinatra Syndrome &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;I Will Do It My Way&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awakening is Not a Walk in the Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh!
