  <title>Divine Father - Ivonne Delaflor Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Divine Father was an opportunity for me to explore masculinity, the male spirit, and the relationship between feminine and masculine energy. It was an opportunity for me to reflect, to examine what I think and believe about what it means to be a man in todays world, how and when I stifle that spirit, and what I can do to touch and release the Divine Father that exists within me. It was an opportunity for me to reflect on the important concepts of balance, my changing role of son, spouse, father, grandfather and all the masculine possibilities that still exist for each of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chick Moorman&lt;/strong&gt;, Author of &lt;em&gt;Parent Talk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talk Sense to yourself&lt;/em&gt; and many more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Divine Father will inspire both men and women to let go of fear and embrace the reality that we are one. The daily sutras, prayers, contemplations and invocations are wonderful tools to sustain the true masculine energy in all of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloe Madanes&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Relationship Breakthrough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divine Father is filled with wisdom, heart, and a world of uplifting ideas. Men will surely benefit from these noble ideas and exercises, and women will gain much too. Thank you, Ivonne, for offering vision, inspiration, practical tools, and hope. Surely the world will be better for readers absorbing and living these noble truths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;A Deep Breath of Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trust that this wonderful book by Ivonne Delaflor will inspire many to create balance as the basis of true holistic experience and its resultant fulfillment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Charles Cannon&lt;/strong&gt;, Spiritual Director of Synchronicity Foundation for Modern Spirituality&lt;/p&gt;" />
