ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Enthusiastic researcher of these disciplines related to psycho-physical well-being, I have obtained the certificate of Reiki Master, Holistic Bio Faith Healer and Master Practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. I have passionately devoted myself to the spreading and popularisation of these powerful techniques and I have actively promoted their knowledge through direct treatments&#39; trials and the “tuning” and harmonisation of all those who wished to master these techniques themselves. My approach to Energy dates back to old experiences still present and disseminated in the interstices of my daily life, such as Yoga, Tai Chi Chuan, Qi Gong, Zhan Zhuang, Plantar Reflexology, Tibetan Rituals and Mentalphysics. All these experiences have invited me to explore multiple dimensions of physycality, way beyond its conception as a simple “assemblage of different parts”. I have immersed myself in a quantic dimension, in permanent contact with the intimate essence of existence: THE UNIVERSAL VITAL ENERGY." />
