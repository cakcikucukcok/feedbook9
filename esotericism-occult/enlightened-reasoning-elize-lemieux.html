  <title>Enlightened Reasoning - Elize Lemieux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enlightened Reasoning
Between the covers of this book, the reader will be taken along on one womans journey, from poverty through crisis, to loss and rebirth of her faith.
Elize Lemieux has gained the courage to share with us the many hills and valleys of her life. These include the loss of a newborn and the estrangement of her daughters. Integral to all of her stories is her recovery from the ills of alcoholism and bipolar disorder.  Perhaps the most poignantly is the love and learning she has shared with her son with Autism.
These pages illustrate in bright colors the metamorphosis of an underprivileged young girl from Northern Ontario, who through determination and resilience became a successful woman now living life joyfully.
She writes, Where once I could only see darkness, pain, suffering and fear, I now see a vastness of light.
Of course no one accomplishes such a transition alone.  In her prose, she gives thanks and profound gratitude too many  her beloved mother and loving sisters, her dear friends and spiritual guides and of course, the lilacs.
Here are stories of tragedy, magic, compassion and everything else one experiences on the path to wisdom and acceptance." />
