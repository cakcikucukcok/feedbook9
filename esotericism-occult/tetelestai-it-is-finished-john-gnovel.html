  <title>Tetelestai - It Is Finished - John Gnovel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And the cunning serpent said, You will not surely die, deceiving mankind into a world filled with misery, sorrow, wickedness, ignorance, death, and destruction. We are at a point of self-destruction, with sickness and disease that are incurable. The only presumed hope mankind has is a miracle drug or genetic engineering.&lt;br /&gt;
But God loved us, his creation, so much that he sacrificed his one and only Son to redeem us from this darkness. He gave us back the light of life, and whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. &lt;br /&gt;
Jesus is the light, and by his death on the cross, he redeemed us body, soul, and spirit. A life filled with love, peace, joy, happiness, and prosperity separating us from misery, sorrow, suffering, sickness, disease, and poverty. &lt;br /&gt;
Why is the reset button not working? What went wrong? Why are Christians saved on the cross still living in darkness? &lt;br /&gt;
We have to break free; the Devil is denying us of our victory. Jesus taught us that if we follow him, we will never walk in darkness but receive the light of life.&lt;br /&gt;
This book will reveal the teachings of Jesus, our Savior and healer, and with the power of this knowledge, you will be able to shatter the strongholds of the crafty Satan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
