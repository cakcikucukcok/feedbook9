  <title>Let&#39;s Go Home - Bernadette O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Go Home, Finding There While Staying Here is a timeless tale of love and loss,&lt;br /&gt;
truth, growth and spirituality that speaks to anyone who has ever felt lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we find there while staying here - especially when darkness shrouds our&lt;br /&gt;
path?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the central question of Let&amp;#39;s Go Home, Bernadette O&amp;#39;Connor&amp;#39;s debut novel.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the story of Halia, a beautiful free-spirited soul, and her quest to find there,&lt;br /&gt;
the elusive weird and wonderful world of her childhood and of snowy mountain&lt;br /&gt;
escapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she runs from her pain, Halia creates a fa&amp;ccedil;ade to find acceptance in a world&lt;br /&gt;
where she feels lost, alone and misunderstood. She makes friends with Snow,&lt;br /&gt;
who promises to take her home, only to slowly steal her soul. To the outside world&lt;br /&gt;
Halia has it all, but she sees through the fa&amp;ccedil;ade she has carefully constructed.&lt;br /&gt;
Knowing it can never be enough, she sticks a needle in her arm, desperately&lt;br /&gt;
seeking there, unable to find it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her journey back, her father, who abandoned her as a child, teaches her to&lt;br /&gt;
stop running and face her pain, and an enchanting wise woman, Tabitha enters&lt;br /&gt;
her life and guides her through her darkness and the hidden stories within her&lt;br /&gt;
soul. In voyaging beyond her comfort to reclaim herself and find her way home,&lt;br /&gt;
Halia discovers that there is a thin veil between joy and heartbreak, light and dark,&lt;br /&gt;
here and there - will she lift the veil and embrace what lies beyond?&lt;/p&gt;" />
