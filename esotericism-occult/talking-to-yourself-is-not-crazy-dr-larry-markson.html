  <title>Talking to Yourself Is Not Crazy - Dr. Larry Markson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thats right, regardless of what anyone says, &lt;i&gt;Talking To Yourself Is Not Crazy&lt;/i&gt;, especially when you do it on purpose, as an instrument to bolster your confidence and strengthen your ability for peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-talk is what you think and say about yourself, &lt;i&gt;both in your head and aloud&lt;/i&gt;, each and every morning of your life and throughout the day. It is a method of helping you to feel good about yourself, to pepper your subconscious mind with thoughts and emotions that you want to embed, so that when the time comes you can reference and express them with sincerity and conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-talk that I am speaking about in this book is the talk you use to either simply program your brain to attract what it is that you want to create in your life or to overcome adversity and turn your thinking process around to something more productive. &lt;/p&gt;" />
