  <title>What Does God Want from Me? - Peggy Merritt Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her book, What Does God Want From Me? Peggy Merritt Hammond shares her personal journey to the heart of God. Watch how her faith grows as she learns to hear Gods voice, learns to trust God and finds peace and direction for her life. Follow Peggy through divorce, depression, sickness, loss, etc. and discover how you, too, can come out a winner! 
Do you know without a doubt that God loves you? I mean really know that you know that God loves you! If you really know that God loves you, then you can trust Him with your life. You can trust Him, no matter what the circumstances, to bring all things together for your good and His glory. When we take our requests and desires to God we demonstrate our trust in Him. God wants to be involved in every detail of our lives. Its what we trust in but dont yet see that keeps us going. 
Peggy shares her desire to fall in love with Jesus and hopes that her book will encourage you to do the same. The better we know someone, the more we like them; and the more we like them, the more we want to know them. She encourages everyone to read the Bible and get to know God on their own terms, to develop their own personal relationship with Him as Paul tells us in Philippians 2:12-13:  work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose." />
