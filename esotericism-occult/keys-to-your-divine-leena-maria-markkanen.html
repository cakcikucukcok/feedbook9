  <title>Keys to Your Divine - Leena Maria Markkanen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keys to Your Divine&lt;/i&gt; is a book about finding the light within you even in times of illness and hardship. Its about a state of fearlessness that may lead you to transformational recovery, becoming whole through healing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Leena Maria Markkanen recovered from life-threatening illnesses. From the very first diagnosis she decided not to make any decision based on fear, which also meant she didnt accept chemotherapy as part of her treatment. Light messages, as Leena calls the guidance she received channeled through her various healers, helped her to work through her fears. Rising above suffering leads to a shift to a higher dimension that could be called heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leena is a social psychologist with extensive experience as a well-being instructor and speaker. Today, she focuses on helping people find their own light, inner peace, fearlessness, and strength.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;i&gt;The Keys to Your Divine&lt;/i&gt;, I had the profound insight that you can relieve your suffering and become free from fear by starting to truly trust your own guiding light, allowing the grace to flow into your life. Let the light guide you to the universal love, no expensive courses or gurus needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is intended to raise the readers spirits in the midst of their everyday struggles, illnesses, or sorrows. Through her own experiences, Leena Maria Markkanen is able to shed her light on this important topic and guide the reader on the path to the divine self and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
