      <meta name="description" content="The author, now in his early 70s, has had a life-time of exercise and sports training, in addition to a  40-year long career as a veterinary pathologist and researcher. As FitOldDog, he has developed an approach to safe exercise for better health based on his experience with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, combined with continued Ironman training. His method is directed by the FitOldDog Training Wheel that takes you through a progressive approach to exercise and training. Unlike other methods, it starts with, and has an emphasis on, the incorporation of body awareness and movement training into your daily workouts. It addresses the general issue of safe exercise after major surgery, and will guide you along the best path for your particular health challenge. The author&#39;s goal is to provide you with the tools you need for the active life that you deserve as you age. The rest is up to you!" />
