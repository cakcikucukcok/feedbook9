  <title>Extraordinary Knowledge - K. R.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book covers topics such as psychology, science, spirituality, myths and unexplained phenomena, and more. It also covers topics such as spiritual awakening and planetary shifts.  This book leads you through the vast amount of information being relayed by the Zetas in answer to questions posed to their emissary, Nancy Lieder. &lt;p&gt;The book also contains information on the government&#39;s involvement in the alien and UFO&#39;s cover-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth is scheduled to transition to 4th Density spiritual. After the switch humans will find that all humans, whether they have graduated to a 4th Density spiritual plane or not, have moved. For some entities, they will recall living through the cataclysms and then later through a time when humans seemed more mentally connected and in touch with one another. Then, upon death, they will be moved to another 3rd Density world, with others who will share these memories. Back to 3rd Density, to continue their orientation lesson.&lt;/p&gt; Just as living beings, such as the Zetas and humans, can be in different densities, coexisting in the same spot but being unaware of each other, so planets can and do so coexist. 4th Density planets are not as prevalent as planets in the root density, for obvious reasons. Planets are moved to 4th Density only to support life in 4th Density, and most planets do not have any life at all. 
&lt;p&gt;This book was written in hopes of updating people&#39;s minds that we are all immortal spirits on a journey throughout this wonderful Universe God has created.&lt;/p&gt;" />
