	attract desirable situations, people, and experiences;
	release and replace troubling emotions;

	regain the confidence and power to make decisions for yourself.
Subtle Energy and the World We Experience also includes
	stories of souls of the dead crossing over;

The author comes from a Christian perspective of more than twenty-five years and explains how subtle energy operates in the area of religious persuasion, and how to get free from its influence to reach a higher potential and live a more meaningful life." />
