&lt;p&gt;Although most of us pray to God, or some form of higher spiritual consciousness, doesnt it seem odd that we perceive this presence as separate from us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this turbulent time of change and transformation, so many are asking, why does life have to be so challenging; why disease, why famine, why poverty, why war, why am I alone? Our plight on this Earth begs the question, where is this divine and loving presence we innately call to? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was weighing heavily on my mind as I helplessly witnessed a beautiful young soul be taken by leukemia. It was while questioning, Where is God? that from the silence of seemingly unanswered prayers I was asked, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you ready now?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  I was totally perplexed. What did it mean? And who was calling to me? Was it God? Was it an angel? Or was it perhaps just my imagination? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks I pondered both the question and its origin, and although I was indeed fearful of embracing that which was so unknown, something from within said, &lt;i&gt;This is your calling. Have courage and move forward in faith. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weeks passed, I sat idle, uncertain as to the course to choose, but then alas the thought of moving forward into that unknown didnt seem any scarier than sitting still. Cautiously I answered. Yes, I am ready, I said, Im ready to embrace this calling I feel from within me, but Ill only do this in the vein of love and peace, with honor and dignity, and in the spirit of the Christ consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was there that my journey began, one that swiftly moved me into the heart of what I call a spiritual awakening. Long forgotten gifts of clairvoyance began emerging into the forefront of my awareness. I was having visions of past lives and found myself acutely aware of those in spirit, often times hearing their directives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I began recording the guidance I perceived them to be conveying in a journal. As I did, to my amazement it became abundantly clear that not only was I connecting with loved ones who had passed, but with a host of spirit guides, angels and ascended masters. &lt;/p&gt;
Several years of walking the path had passed when one evening as I read a message for a friend, synchronicity opened a door. It sounds like the message was written just for me, she said. Over the course of the next several months there were nearly a dozen people for whom I read that made the same exact comment. Thats when I knew that the messages were meant to be shared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the grace of God, that which is conveyed in this book has been provided only by those who resonate with the vibration of Love and Light. They come from many spheres of spiritual consciousness, including ascended masters, angels, and Archangels. I have chosen to refer to them collectively as &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spirit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one reads from their messages, it becomes obvious that they are not contrary to any religion, nor are they postulating a religion. They are merely supplemental revelations spoken through divine grace in order that we might understand a little bit more about divine design, about karma and the power each of us holds in our words, deeds and actions. They offer enlightening information about why life is, and how we can and will affect our own future collectively and individually as evolving spirits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The best way to allow the messages to serve you is to hold the book in your hands and simply ask in the name of Love and Light, that guidance be revealed that will serve your highest good.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relax and breathe in the loving presence of divine grace, letting go any other thoughts. When you are ready, randomly open the book. You will undoubtedly be drawn to a message that will speak directly to your situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit says, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take from these messages that which truly speaks to your heart, and know that what we share with you comes in and of the divine Light.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the choices we make in our words, deeds and actions, we create our own tempering. It is drawn unto us and thus becomes the living proof of who we are and that which we have learned regarding love and compassion, respect and honor, to name a few. And in so making these choices, we are creating the karma that will shape the future lessons of not only this life, but the ones to come. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You will reap that which you sow, the great master Jesus said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; By collective choice, the future is ours to sow. We can engage the energy of Love and Light, or we can wallow in the energy of fear and negativity. The question is, which will we choose? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Love and Light,&lt;/p&gt;
