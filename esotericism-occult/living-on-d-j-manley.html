      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Jeffrey felt nauseous and weak in the knees. One certainty he was fully aware of was that he wasnt ready for his time on Earth to be over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Surely, if I am dead, I would know it, wouldnt I? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At least for the moment, he didnt feel dead, but then again, being dead wasnt something he was so sure that he would know how to feel. An emotion beyond terror gripped his mind as he tried to bring some sort of logic to the circumstances of his demise. This was impossible and certainly not the way he had planned to spend his weekend, nor was it even remotely feasible in the plans he had made for his future endeavors during and after college. &lt;/p&gt;" />
