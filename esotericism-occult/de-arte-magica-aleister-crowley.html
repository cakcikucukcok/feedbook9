  <title>De Arte Magica - Aleister Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aleister Crowley was a noted and controversial occultist, ceremonial magician and poet. He has been called &amp;quot;the wickedest man in the world&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;or &amp;quot;The Great Beast 666 &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;BAPHOMET&amp;quot; but he remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counterculture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He founded the religion of Thelema, which became adopted by the Ordo Templis Orientis (O.T.O.) as well as the magical order Argenteum Astrum, the Order of the Silver Star.&lt;br /&gt;
Also known as Liber CDXIV, &amp;quot;De Arte Magica&amp;quot; is an essay on the secret of the IXth degree of the O.T.O. that was originally published in &amp;quot;Die Oriflamme,&amp;quot; in Germany by Theodore Reuss in 1914. This text is a foundational text for Thelema and is recommended to initiates. This is a valuable book to anyone interested in occult studies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt :&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This secret is the true Key to Magick; that is, by the right use of this secret man may impose his Will on Nature herself, as will appear hereafter in this comment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In this way, although all recorded Knowledge were destroyed, it would be possible for an adept of this secret to restore it.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;" />
