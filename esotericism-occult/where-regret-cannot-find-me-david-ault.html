  <title>Where Regret Cannot Find Me - David Ault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A powerful new voice in the inspirational field! Where Regret Cannot Find Me by David Ault is a captivating debut by one of America&#39;s leading motivators and ministers. This collection of spiritual essays honors the full spectrum of our human emotions - whether addressing grief and sorrow, the path of forgiveness, answering the call within or seeing the gift in life&#39;s greatest challenges, this deeply personal book offers encouragement and instruction to creating practical shifts in our everyday lives. From David&#39;s beginnings in a small Southeast Texas town, to his years as a popular visionary vocalist, to trekking through the ruins of Peru or climbing The Great Wall of China, David&#39;s sense of adventure and connection with the Divine make for unforgettable storytelling.
Where Regret Cannot Find Me is a warm and sensitive guide that illuminates many of life&#39;s most important lessons with humility and intelligence. David Ault mixes his own personal odyssey with teachings from a variety of religious faiths, creating a book that leads the reader gently from our ever present vulnerability to the profound power of the human spirit, a journey to help our hearts heal and grow. A wise and good read.
Frederic Luskin, Ph.D. Director Stanford Forgiveness Projects author of Forgive for Good: A Proven Prescription for Health and Happiness.
God bless David Ault (and God does bless David &quot;The Old Beloved.&quot;) Not only does he sing with a voice Celestial, but his writing enchants the reader&#39;s heart and cultivates ones Soul and Spirit. The world is a better place because of his new endeavor.
