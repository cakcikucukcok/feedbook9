  <title>MENSPIRATION - Ronald K Thornhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever injured yourself, perhaps on the basketball court, and experienced severe pain that just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away? As a man, you think you can handle it, but over time it continues to get worse. Your doctors inform you that they have the remedy for your pain, yet you struggle with making the decision to follow the doctor&amp;rsquo;s orders. Instead, you choose the least painful route that provides temporary relief only to find yourself in a situation where other problems begin to surface, and now you have a big mess on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like this physical injury, many of us have been injured in the game of life. A small situation left unchecked grows into a much larger problem, and the mojo and inspiration you once had seems to have disappeared. Consequently, you find yourself struggling and making mistakes. In &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menspiration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Ronald Thornhill, provides workable solutions for how to conquer life&amp;rsquo;s mountains and how to regain your inspiration and motivation, all from the perspectives of a father, pastor, coach, and educator. Join us on this journey as you rediscover your motivation and inspiration so that you can plant the chequered flag on every mountaintop in your life&lt;/p&gt;" />
