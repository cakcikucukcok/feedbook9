      <meta name="description" content="Celebrate your child as a gift to the universe!
Take Hold of Heaven offers children of planet Earth the opportunity to become aware of their innate gift of divine potential.
Parents are their childrens first and best teachers, the founders and architects of their lives. Take Hold of Heaven, with thirteen spiritual truths, will inspire parents and children to create a harmonious, spirit-filled life with reverence for all.
Take Hold of Heaven is a valuable introduction for parents, teachers, and children of all ages. We need to understand who and what we are in order to establish the connection with our grand and glorious universe.
Virginia Essene, spiritual author and educator
Take Hold of Heaven synthesizes the authors experience as teacher, parent, and minister. She offers uplifting ideas and information to guide children of the new millennium. The quiet nurturing she is known to embody comes through the hopeful truths, inspiring poems, and practical lessons. With humanity re-awakening to ideals of fellowship and global stewardship, Take Hold of Heaven comes at just the right time.
Lynn Rogers, MA, author and educator
Every conscientious parent must read Take Hold of Heaven. It offers keys to the cosmos, to your childs being, and shows ways you can develop an uplifting, quality parent/child relationship.
