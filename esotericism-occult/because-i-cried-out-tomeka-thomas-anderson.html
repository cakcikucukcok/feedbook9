  <title>Because I Cried Out - Tomeka Thomas Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you dont have the answers to your relationship issues, &lt;br/&gt;
crying out to God is the answer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in relationships will often ask the same type of questions. Why wont he change? Is he ever going to marry me? Is he the one for me? Can I get out of this relationship? What will I do without him?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because I Cried Out&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of nine testimonials given by women specifically for the woman who desperately seek answers to promote change for herself and her love life. It is a tell-all as each woman delves into the inner most parts of her relationship that other woman are uncomfortable discussing. Each woman has managed to overcome obstacles after identifying that her own pain and resolution has come from within. It wasnt until each cried out that she was able to embrace a freedom that only God could give. It is phenomenal what each discovers while looking back in retrospect. It is difficult for any woman to read &lt;i&gt;Because I Cried Out&lt;/i&gt;, and not see her own reflection at one moment of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
