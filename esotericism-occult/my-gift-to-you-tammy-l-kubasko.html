  <title>My Gift to You - Tammy L. Kubasko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the time you were young, youve had a dream that one day you would do something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several chapters into your life later, you wonder where all the days went and why youve lost or forgotten the dream that you had since you were young. Youve searched and at times sacrificed security and sanity to find it. Even so, you only have more questions than answers and a memory that serves to make you both smile and cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did the youthful heart that hoped and dreamed without bounds and believed nothing was impossible go? Where did the youthful spirit that could create options that did not exist go? Where did the youthful heart that would play with an open mind, open heart, and carefree passion go? Where did the youthful spirit that thrived on challenges go? Where did the youthful heart that believed in magic go? Where did the youthful spirit that was enthusiastically and passionately in love with life go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Gift to You is the first book in a three-book series that shares the book writing adventures of a spiritual journey from the mind (fear) to the heart (faith). My Gift to You is a story to help you remember and celebrate who you truly are. All that is needed is an open mind and the willingness to discover what is waiting to be found.&lt;/p&gt;" />
