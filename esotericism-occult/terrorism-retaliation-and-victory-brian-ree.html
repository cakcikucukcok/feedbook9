  <title>Terrorism, Retaliation, and Victory - Brian Ree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We could use some help. Whatever you think of the present situation in Iraq, about President Bush and our nations Global War on Terror, about all the political spin that is being put on current events, we can all agree: we could use some help.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The threat of terrorist attack persists; the threat of chemical warfare and/or biological warfare may even have increased. Whether or not Saddam Hussein still had weapons of mass destruction (WMD), other regimes that support terrorism do have them, and we cannot be sure that they are not sharing them with terrorists determined to hurt us. Even a single completed attack with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons will be intolerable. While we can count on our military to prevail in a stand-up fight, military history and current events teach us that we cannot defeat this enemy by force of arms alone. Indeed, despite all our prowess and strength, we remain vulnerable; it seems just a matter of time before we are struck again.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How can we prevail in the battle for the hearts and minds of the populations from whence tomorrows terrorists may come? Fortunately, there are things we can do. Field-tested, proven cutting edge research reveals that subtle psychological operations can disarm opponents, promote peace and inhibit attacks on our soldiers overseas and on our citizenry at home. The implementation of novel solutions will require that we abandon politics as usual, overcome our ignorance and apathy, and stop kowtowing to moneyed special interests and the agendas of corporate greed. We must demonstrate the will to be true to the most fundamental principles of America.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What can you do? Read the excerpt. Get the book. Contact your representatives. Become knowledgeable. Be active. Hold people in business and government accountable. Lets move forward: do your part.&lt;/P&gt;" />
