  <title>Healthy Gaians - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="[Headline, in boldface and/or small caps; do in 2 lines maximum]
The healthier we are in body, mind, and culture, the more we can happily interact with the Spirit of Earth or Gaia, who needs our attention now.&lt;/p&gt;
[Main text]
&lt;p&gt;Health, how to keep it, regain it, or even optimize it, concerns many today. But we usually think of health in personal terms, human terms. What about the health of the Earth? To be healthy rather than sick has planetary implications, and &lt;i&gt;Healthy Gaians&lt;/i&gt; shows you ways of improving your health to help improve the planet&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a diverse anthology of 70 articles on human health drawn from a journalistic career spanning 25 years. Here are bodywork, cancer, the immune system, vaccinations, eurythmy, chakras, Jungian psychology, intuition, conflict resolution, healing with art, music, sound, and color, singing to the dying, dreams, water rejuvenation, the poetics of the elements, near-death experiences, the purpose of evil, myth-living, and quantum-shamanic adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll get familiar with lots of natural health modalities such as herbalism, acupuncture, flower essences, and bionutrient fortification. And meet a stimulating group of health pioneers, such as R.D. Laing, William Irwin Thompson, Barbara Walker, Fred Alan Wolf, Robert Sardello, Caroline Myss, M.F.K. Fisher, Kyriacos Markides, and Rowena Kryder, among others. Each gives innovative ways to free ourselves from the ill-health constraints of body, mind, and culture as part of the larger process of becoming healthy Gaians-exactly what the planet needs from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to better health. The important thing is to start getting healthy so you can help the planet in its time of need. Then the Earth can start sending back the good health vibrations to you now you&#39;re back in the health loop.&lt;/p&gt;
[Note: Be sure to note boldface two-line headline at top; this is 250 words but the book&#39;s format will be large and it will fit easily without crowding." />
