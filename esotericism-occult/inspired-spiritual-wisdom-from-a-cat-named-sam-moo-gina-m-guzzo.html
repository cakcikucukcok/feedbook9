  <title>Inspired Spiritual Wisdom from a Cat Named Sam-Moo - Gina M Guzzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Inspired Spiritual wisdom from a cat named Sam-Moo. This fun filled and wise book is inspired by my cat Sam-Moo who died in 2010. In the last 10 days of his life I began to pay greater attention to him. He seemed to begin to whisper inspiration and wisdom to me in those last days. As I began to write it down I realized that he surely did have wisdom and inspiration to share.  His overall message was simple, we as humans just need to spend more time being than doing and just love and chill out. To him it was really very simple. It is a profound message of inspired wisdom and humor about how to live each day simply and in the moment. Zen kitty wisdom for everyday living. &lt;/p&gt;" />
