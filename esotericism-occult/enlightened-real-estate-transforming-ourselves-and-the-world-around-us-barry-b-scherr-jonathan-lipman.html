  <title>Enlightened Real Estate: Transforming Ourselves and The World Around Us - Barry B Scherr, Jonathan Lipman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NEW DIRECTION FOR REAL ESTATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does real estate evolve and grow with the times? Or does brick-and-mortar, by its nature, hold back progress, trapping us in traffic, low affordability, and endless rebuilding?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enlightened Real Estate&lt;/em&gt; will open our eyes to the astonishing potential of the man-made world. The reconstruction of buildings, towns, and cities will be the basis for the next great economic expansion. From abstract idea to practical application, &lt;em&gt;Enlightened Real Estate &lt;/em&gt;explores the mindset behind the built environment of today and offers a new enlightened vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAVIGATING THIS NEW PARADIGM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are presently in the midst of one of the greatest transformations in the history of human culture. The simultaneous rise of technological breakthroughs and world consciousness is unprecedented. Old ways of thinking are being swept away. Power structures that dominated for decades are crumbling. New opportunities are arising. People everywhere are questioning how to navigate this new paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As consciousness rises, a new lifestyle will emerge and real estate will regain its traditional role as a stabilizing structure in society. Rising interest in walkable zones, alternative energy, meditation, yoga, and organic food are the first signs of this transformation that is revolutionizing the way we live.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our buildings and communities need to resonate with this emerging lifestyle and reflect a higher goal for our society. A new asset class, the Ideal Village, is a holistic, practical blueprint for buildings and communities that support this stress-free, enlightened approach to life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From homeowners and government to real estate developers, planners, and investors, everyone can benefit from a deeper understanding of how real estate impacts every aspect of daily life and the society at-large.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
