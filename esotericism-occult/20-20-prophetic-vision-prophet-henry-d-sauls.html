  <title>20/20 Prophetic Vision - Prophet Henry D. Sauls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="20/20 Vision is designed so that the reader can clearly see both realms of existence, the spiritual realm and the natural realm. In this book you will learn basic principles for activating the spiritual realm and being led by the Holy Spirit, which produces spiritual insight and wisdom through prayer and faith. Believers in Christ learn to transfer spiritual blessings into physical blessings by birthing them through confession and belief, manifesting them in the natural realm in our walk with Christ. 
Understanding spiritual warfare is vital for manifesting material blessings and prospering in the natural realm. Christians must exercise faith in order to see results come to pass in their lives. Basic principles outlined in this book will give the reader real success in accomplishing goals and dreams. Our perception is reality. 20/20 Vision teaches the believer to have a Christ mind-set by tearing down strongholds through spiritual warfare. Do you live by destiny or default? 
Dont forget to enlist in Gods military. Contract is included in the book, so you can be a warrior and start carrying out the mandate that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has for you. Enjoy the book.
