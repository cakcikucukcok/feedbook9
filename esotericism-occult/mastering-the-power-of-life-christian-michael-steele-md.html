  <title>Mastering the Power of Life - Christian Michael Steele Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life flows through the universe like a river from an infinite Source to you. Mostly unseen by our physical senses, it has power, awareness, intelligence, and the potential to create anything imaginable. Life engages us constantly, but developing the insight to see past our superficial experience requires understanding and practice. New potentials and visions unseen before are revealed. Spiritual laws are simple and precise but require understanding and consciousness. Through our ignorance and the effects of a cold world, our connection with life has been reduced to a mere fraction of its potential. Developing your consciousness allows you to keep out the influences of a negative world as well as recognize the divinity within. The relationship between the consciousness of life and the divinity within your being is fundamental to the ascension process. Understanding this process will naturally reflect on your own development and allow you to navigate through your life more gracefully, effectively, and with more insight. Within this book are many tools to assist you with reclaiming your power and achieving your true freedom. &lt;br&gt;
 Transform your being into its true grandeur&lt;br&gt;
 Learn how to live life consciously&lt;br&gt;
 Improve your meditation practice&lt;br&gt;
 Understand the twelve steps of the ascension process&lt;br&gt;
 Gain insight into the levels within mass consciousness&lt;br&gt;
 Develop solutions to many of lifes common obstacles&lt;br&gt;
 Apply powerful spiritual laws&lt;br&gt;
 Reclaim your power and gain your freedom&lt;br&gt;
