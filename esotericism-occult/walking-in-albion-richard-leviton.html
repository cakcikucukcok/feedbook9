  <title>Walking in Albion - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FICTION&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take a visionary walk through the cosmos right here on the Earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What if you woke up one morning and realized you are the cosmos, all the heavenly 
realms and gods, and a
refl ection of God Himself/Herself? Th at you and the Earth have the same structures of 
consciousness, are
made virtually the same?&lt;p&gt;
Walking in Albion is an amusing, passionate fi rst-person answer to that. It chronicles 
interactions with the
Earth through its sacred sites in a style full of jokes and visions, whinges and 
epiphanies. Leviton reports
life on the path of the Christed Grail Knight in search of a cosmic spirit called Albion, the 
cosmos in a
giant human form, the soul of the planet. Albion is a picture map of Creation, full of 
lights and palaces and
the memories of humanity on Earth since the beginning.&lt;p&gt;
Join Leviton in an odyssey of meditation and visionary experience from sites in Norway, 
France, England,
and Scotland to America, Mexico, and Tahiti. Oh yes, he travels with plenty of sidekicks, 
jokers, and wellwishers,
especially angels.&lt;p&gt;
Want a freshly conceived meditative-spiritual experience that includes the Earth as a 
prime recipient of
your contacts and changes? Walking in Albion is an unusual and original approach to the 
Mysteries of
human and Earth, a fresh, bold way of regarding the authentic Christ, not as dogma but 
experience
yoursin the theater of the Earth. Plus guidelines to relate eff ectively with the 
geomantic landscape,
and have fun and insight doing it, as you contribute to the Earths well-being starting 
today and begin" />
