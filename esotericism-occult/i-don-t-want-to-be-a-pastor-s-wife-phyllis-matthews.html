  <title>I Don’T Want to Be a Pastor’S Wife - Phyllis Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The pages of this book tell of our predestination, which was planned by God from the beginning of time. No doubt about it, God has a purpose for everyone. His purpose for us existed before we even hit planet earth. I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born. I appointed you a prophet to the nations (Jeremiah 1:5 HCSB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God forms each person. Then, He strategically configures each persons trials, situations, and circumstances, tailor-made for them. Each is to accomplish His divine purposeeven the fragmented pieces that are affected by our own choices. He throws nothing away! It all works for our good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For I know the plans I have for youthis is the Lords declarationplans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope (Jeremiah 29:11 HCSB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Phyllis Matthews allows you to witness her personal transformation in action. She put God to the challenge. She was clueless in her life until she allowed God to navigate her steps. A mans heart plans his way, but the Lord determines his steps (Proverbs 16:9 HCSB). Her perception of her life was her reality; it was not Gods interpretation. In other words, God had a different picture than what she was seeing or viewing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
