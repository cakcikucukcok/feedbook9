  <title>The Space Between Two Thoughts: the Teachings of Iam - Dr. Virginia Davis Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The guides, when they come, should bring great feelings of love. This is the true indication that a high guide is present; there are few elseThe guides can only come in the space between two thoughts  in that space between the in-breath and the out-breath, that space that is the quiet pool or reservoir of the deep wisdom within.  IAM&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
IAM represents the wisdom in each of us, and is a true teacher and friend. Written from a whole-brain perspective, The Space Between Two Thoughts is profound and accessible to individuals of all faiths and paths. With humor and compassion, this text weaves over 70 healing transmissions with commentary, dialogue, and easy to use Armchair Enlightenment exercises, demonstrating that the spiritual and material planes are not separate.
What people are saying about IAM:
&lt;p&gt;
IAMs advice and exercises have been very useful for my personal growth and mental well-being. 
&lt;p&gt; IAM has made me realize that there truly is a higher power, and it cares very much about every aspect of our lives, no matter how small. &lt;p&gt;
IAM tells us things about ourselves that are really helpful and transformative in a way that no one else would know. It gives us the clues or guideposts to help us transform and evolve. 
 &lt;p&gt;
A realization that I gained from IAM was the importance of each person, each animal, every plant, every action, every moment. We are all interconnected." />
