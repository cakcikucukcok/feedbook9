  <title>The Descendants of God Book-3 - Bishop. Dalton.G. Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bishop Dalton Burnett is a man of the Word who has a desire to see the plan of God come to maturity in the lives of His people.
With his wife Pastor Sandra Burnett, Bishop pastors Harvestime Evangelistic Ministries in London UK, Birmingham and Pakistan. The expansion of the Kingdom of God is Harvestime Ministries main business.
We believe that the Blessing is being manifested every day in every way.
Luke 14:17-23 Come for all things are now ready is the benchmark for the ministry that God assigned to Bishop Burnett. The main goal is to go bring the halt, the lame, the maimed and the blind into the Kingdom of Christ.
Bishop believes that years of tradition has kept the church from fully understanding, who we are in Christ, our position in the Kingdom of God and the power of Gods Word in our mouth. The Ministry is intent on bringing hurting people to Jesus ensuring that they understand who they really are, so they can experience total freedom in Christ.
Bishop Burnett travels extensively round the world teaching and preaching the undiluted Word of Faith, with the Lord truly confirming his Word with signs and wonders following. The healing anointing has increased greatly and the power of God has been moving in a tremendous way. Bishop refuses to accept anything less and so God always responds to His Word voiced through this man of God. He is a spiritual father and has impacted and inspired many lives.
