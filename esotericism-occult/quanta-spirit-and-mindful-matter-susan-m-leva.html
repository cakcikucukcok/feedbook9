  <title>Quanta, Spirit, and Mindful Matter - Susan M. Leva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Ms. Leva has written a book that goes beyond the 6th sense, and includes Quantum physics for the layman. This theory suggests that human beings are
    connected to each other by means other than just using the power of the mind. Ms. Leva has decided to share her true stories that will take the reader to
    other realms of consciousness and she hopes they will inspire others to share more stories that deal with the unexplained. Quanta, simply means light.
    Her stories include this energy that can be helpful for human beings to live consciously using awareness in thought and behavior. Spirit is the essence of
    ones soul. Matter that is Mindful has been done through rigorous experiments in the sub-atomic world; thereby helping to explain our ability to form
    connections without our knowledge in relation to one another on the blue planet. Knowing this to occur, scientists have been inspired to keep exploring as
    the quest for understanding more about our infinite universe continues. So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride as spooky can be fun while learning to
    become more open to the possibilities of life!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    For me this book could not be written without the expertise of physicists, scientists, biologists, mediums, philosophers, journalists and all those who
    understand that this life is truly an abundance of knowledge coming together from many fields. Each of these pioneers have enabled me to piece together
    some very important answers to my unanswered questions leaving room for many more. Ive had ah,ha moments while reading the work of these folks who are
    my true heroes. They have turned on the light.
