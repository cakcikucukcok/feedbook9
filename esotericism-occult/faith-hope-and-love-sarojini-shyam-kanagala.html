  <title>Faith, Hope, and Love - Sarojini, Shyam Kanagala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A portion of the book proceeds will be used towards the Clean India Mission (Swachh Bharat Abhiyan/Village Upliftment).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A sculptor sees the beautiful statue: the image of a Jesus, a Buddha, a Rama, a Krishna, or a Sai hidden in a boulder. All his effort is essentially to remove the obscuring rock and release the image that was all along within. The Lord himself is the Divine Sculptor. The world is the Sculptors studio; life and the experiences it affords are the tools used by the Divine Sculptor to chisel out the excess rock and release the divine image trapped in the human boulder. This is a story of such transformation from unhewn self to radiant Self.
Sarojini and Shyam Kanagala are seekers of the higher wisdom. They participate actively in nonprofit organizations dedicated to serving under privileged communities in different parts of the world including - the U.S.A, Nepal, and India.
This little book contains all the gems of the universal teachings of all the ancient masters of spiritual cultures past and present; that of love, inner peace, and brotherhood...a birthright of all who manifest on this tiny planet. 
 Isaac Burton Tigrett, founder of The Hard Rock Cafe
 and The House of Blues
This book is a delightful two-part ride into deep spacespiritual spacein a cosmic chariot drawn by two quite different yet matching steeds. Part I, The Journey Begins, consists of Sarojinis true life stories that help clear up why were all here. Part II, Home Coming, is husband Shyams learned probe into what here really means and lays out the map for getting to it.
