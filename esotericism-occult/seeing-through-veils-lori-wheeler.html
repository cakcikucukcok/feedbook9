  <title>Seeing Through Veils - Lori Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lori Wheeler has the ability to see those who have crossed over to the other side. She has no idea how or why she was chosen to have this ability, but after several years, she has helped many people deal with and get through suicide, murder, illness, and grief. Lori is aware that, with her ability, comes a great bit of responsibility, and she doesnt take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing through Veils has been in the works for the past seven years. It is intended to help you understand the step-by-step process of pain and heal the agony of losing a loved one. In this book, Lori enumerates the difference in the five veils and why they are important in the healing process. She believes in signs, and the signs you think you see you often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when someone crosses to the other side? The ability to communicate with loved ones who have passed on has given Lori a great insight into other planes, dimensions, or veils of life. She will lovingly guide you through each veil and explain what they mean. Grief can make us feel stuck, bored, sad, and hopeless. The pain doesnt always end with the comfort of knowing what happens to your loved one after death, but it can eventually blossom into love and peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
