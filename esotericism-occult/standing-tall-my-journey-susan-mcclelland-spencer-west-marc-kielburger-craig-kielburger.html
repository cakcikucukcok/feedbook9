  <title>Standing Tall: My Journey - Susan McClelland, Spencer West, Marc Kielburger, Craig Kielburger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Spencer West is many things. Accomplished speaker. University graduate. Natural prankster. Former cheerleader. And a young man without legs&amp;mdash;something that has never held him back. Spencer was born without the use of his legs. When he was five, doctors decided to amputate below his pelvis to better help him get around. It didn&amp;#8217;t bother him; he was Superman and nothing would ever get in his way. Or so he thought. Navigating through life on his hands, Spencer has always lived with purpose. But he wanted more out of life than just a paycheque and material possessions. He wanted to make an impact but wasn&amp;#8217;t always sure how. That was until he had the epiphany: He was different for a reason. Infused with humour and humility, Spencer has never lost the hope or courage he needed to tackle personal obstacles&amp;mdash;bullying, isolation, failure, or pride. His secret? Always standing tall.&lt;/div&gt;" />
