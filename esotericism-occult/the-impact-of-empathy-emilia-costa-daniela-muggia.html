  <title>The Impact of Empathy - Emilia Costa, Daniela Muggia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and children diagnosed with it are often subjected to heavy and risky therapies based on psychopharmacological drugs. What if there were another, non-invasive, way to help them?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The innovation of the approach presented in this book is threefold:&lt;br /&gt;
1) it takes into account the new paradigm introduced by the evolution of quantum physics (we can have more information if we are in a suitable state to grasp it, and at the same time we can communicate the state of great peace that we can train ourselves to attain);&lt;br /&gt;
2) it introduces the concept of the collective &amp;ldquo;mandala of suffering&amp;rdquo;;&lt;br /&gt;
3) it inserts into the well-oiled mechanism of self perpetuated suffering a transformative element that brings the procedure to a halt, without worrying too much whether the new element is introduced through the child, the parents, the teachers, or the therapist or the carer.&lt;br /&gt;
The inspiration comes from the method ECEL&amp;reg;, Empathic Care at the End of Life, which derives from the marriage of Tibetan thanatology and neuroscience. It is based on a state of great empathy that characterises both the child and the dying person, and that the carer can learn to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Emilia Costa&lt;/b&gt;, MD, a former professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy at La Sapienza University in Rome, has authored over 360 pioneering scien&amp;shy;tific&amp;shy;publications.&amp;shy;She&amp;shy;stud&amp;shy; ied directly with some great masters &amp;ndash; Carl Jung, Roberto Assagioli, an Italian Psychiatrist and&amp;shy; pioneer&amp;shy; in&amp;shy; the&amp;shy; fields&amp;shy; of&amp;shy; humanistic and transpersonal psychology, and Psychiatrist Gianfranco Tedeschi, founding member of the professional&amp;nbsp;Jungian group, AIPA, in Italy. Currently, she is the Dean of the&amp;shy; Scientific&amp;shy; Committee&amp;shy; of&amp;shy; Pharmacovigilance&amp;shy; with&amp;shy; the&amp;shy; organization Hands off the Children, which works to inform teachers, parents, medical doctors and scientists about the danger of over prescription of drugs to children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daniela Muggia &lt;/b&gt;is a Thanatologist and the winner of the prestigious Terzani Award for the Medical Humanities in 2008. For almost 30 years years she studied the Tibetan tradition of death and dying with Sogyal Rinpoche, author of the ground-breaking &lt;i&gt;Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&lt;/i&gt;. She also trained with Cesare Boni, a professor and teacher of Master classes in Thanatology, the study of death and dying, at Naples University. After more than 20 years of working with the terminally ill, she has developed the ECEL method, Empathic Care at the End of Life, one of the most popular courses taught in hospitals, hospices and for Masters degree programs in Palliative Care at universities in Italy and other countries.&lt;br /&gt;
