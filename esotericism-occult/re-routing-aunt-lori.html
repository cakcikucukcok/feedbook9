  <title>Re-Routing - Aunt Lori</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a rule book for life. Its about dealing with lifes many difficulties and challenges and how to rise above them. It is essentially about spiritual growth and reveals in detail the secrets of a successful life. 
This book includes indispensable guides that will help you on lifes journey and motivate and empower you to evolve to the next level. It will help you achieve more out of life, gain a sense of peace and happiness, personal empowerment, and a richer, meaningful existence.
This book is predicated on the universal laws, which are principles that govern everything and everybody in the universe. These universal laws have been scientifically supported and have been known about throughout the ages by a limited group of people. Few people know about them, very few people understand them, and very few people know how to apply them. Comprised of information that every parent should share with their children, these principles are explained within these pages in great detail. Real-life examples are used, and how-to tips and techniques are included. Information, anecdotes, advice, and step-by-step directions will leave you strengthened and encouraged. After you have read this book, you will be empowered to not only survive but to win at everything.
If you have a problem or need guidance or inspiration, you may also use this book as an intuitive conduit. You must first quiet your mind, then meditate on the issue, then ask God to show you where to start. Then randomly open this book to any page. You will find your answer, your direction, your guidance, your inspiration, or your encouragement. 
The author has included poems that were inspired by her own circumstances and ordeals, as well as those of others. All are about life and life lessons, which are meant to instill encouragement, strength, inner peace, and hope." />
