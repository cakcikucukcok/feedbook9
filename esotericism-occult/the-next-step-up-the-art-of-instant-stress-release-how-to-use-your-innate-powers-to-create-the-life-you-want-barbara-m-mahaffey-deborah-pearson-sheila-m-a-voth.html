  <title>The Next Step Up: The Art of Instant Stress Release, How to use your innate powers to create the life you want - Barbara M Mahaffey, Deborah Pearson, Sheila M.A. Voth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first book in the Transformation Series. These books are designed to help you create the best life you really want to live...on the inside, your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and health and on the outside your relationships, your work...basically all your interaction with life. Each book is about The Next Step Up in showing you how to understand and transform what is not working for you into what does work for you. You will learn easy, yet powerful methods that enable you to make these important life changing transitions easily and wisely. After decades of working in multiple health care-fields, I&amp;rsquo;ve identified the following areas as most crucial and fundamental to help people help themselves be balanced, clear, happy, healthy and stress-free...both in mind-body-spirit and in the daily living of their personal and professional lives. These core areas are: &amp;bull; True-Self or ego...your choice of how you think, feel and behave from your True-Self or from your ego &amp;bull; Energy Awareness...what energy is and how it works for you &amp;bull; Instant Stress Release...how to stop stressing and shift into calm and clear thinking and acting instead ? &amp;bull; Improving Relationships... how to make relationships work, both personally and professionally ? &amp;bull; Happiness, Health, Healing and Nutrition...since your health and happiness are greatly determined by what you think, feel and eat, it&amp;rsquo;s how to make wise choices and use energy to expedite all healing The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing the series of The Next Step Up books is to give you effective and powerful tools and strategies which show you how to tap into and utilize your innate abilities of Knowing how to be stress free, happy and clear each day of your life plus much, much more. ? ?The next sentence contains the most important concept you will use in your entire life. You will be shown how to shift your compulsive negative thinking (caused by your ego&amp;rsquo;s fearful thoughts and emotions) into affirmative and confident thoughts from your True-Self. When you perceive and handle life from your lower-self, the negative ego, your life will seem to be full of conflict, stress and tiredness because that&amp;rsquo;s how your ego makes you think and behave. When you perceive and handle life from your highest-self, your True-Self or Soul or Truth, life will be good, easy and energizing because Soul gives you clarity, confidence and wisdom. You can choose which way you want to live your life... from a low, dense vibratory level, or a high, clear and powerful vibratory level. ? If you find yourself functioning from your lower-self, you will now have the tools to instantly shift out of stressful thoughts and into uplifting thoughts and behavior instead! You have the power to change and create from the &amp;ldquo;real you...your True- Self&amp;rdquo; anytime you desire. You already are the &amp;ldquo;Real You&amp;rdquo; on the inside. I just give you the tools and &amp;ldquo;know how&amp;rdquo; to access your Soul&amp;rsquo;s power, clarity and wisdom to use any time you choose. Have fun and expect miracles using your innate ability to help resolve problem relationships, work and stressful situations in your life. Remember it&amp;rsquo;s all in the perception. When you perceive life from ego, life is hard and stressful. But now you can choose to instantly shift out of being tired and stressed and into powerful and clear perceiving from your True-Self. It feels great...do it often. This book, The Next Step Up: The Art of Instant Stress Release is a guide to show you how to shift out of being stressed and into clear thinking and feeling instead. When your mind is controlled by your ego, you experience stress. When your mind is aligned with your Soul, you experience clarity which releases the toxic effects of stress from your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
