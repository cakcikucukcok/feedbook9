  <title>On Earth as It Is in Heaven - Kristin Scneider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This story is about life, death, pain and love, and the way they are intertwined to form the unique fabric that is the life of Sibyl.
We join with Sibyl as she traces her life, beginning during the Second World War as a small child, struggling to find her place, in a world of where parents and siblings often seem unreachable.
As she recounts events during her years of school, university and marriage we begin to form a picture of a complex, passionate woman, who turns her frequent struggles with panic into an ebb and flow of fear and love. We share with Sibyl 
the relief she feels as she begins to witness the causes of her panic leading to acceptance and understanding.
She beckons us to follow her as she embarks on a journey into her love affair with David, a voyage filled with magnificent love, but also deep grief, and we share her pain as she chooses to make one of the biggest sacrifices of her life  the 
giving of a gift of love, that will haunt her for many years to come.  Unseen, we walk with her as she continues her days alone. We share with her in the joy she finds after Davids death, the birth of a loving spiritual connection that raises 
her consciousness, strengthens her love and gives her a new understanding of the splendour of life.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I spied your book at a friend&#39;s house, and read it. I had no idea you were such a gifted writer! I could hardly put it down. And i knew you were courageous, but your courage really shines through the whole book, as well as through 
your writing of it. I am full of admiration - you have an extraordinary ability to put  feelings into words. I do hope you will write more.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Paula Polson, Victoria
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have just finished reading your book, in many ways it spoke to me. It&#39;s a great book and I hope it will touch other lives. It came at a time I needed it.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
