  <title>Look for the Good and You&#39;ll Find God - Echo Bodine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since discovering her psychic and healing abilities in her teens, Echo Bodine has used those gifts to help others. While working as a barber, she often sensed when a client needed healing, and she’d silently provide it. She’s helped people communicate with dead loved ones and helped others using the healing power that flows from her hands. She didn’t always realize what her abilities meant or how to use them, but Echo continued to seek guidance. She discovered that as she sought the good in people and experiences, she also found the love of God and the power of good that come with spiritual practice. 
Join Echo for this ride through the incredible events of her life’s journey. From one night’s sighting of both comedian Bob Hope and a UFO to a glimpse into a European past life to a tangle with the IRS and a trip to Hollywood to explore reality television, all of Echo’s adventures have deepened her understanding of God and her own humanity. Even situations that looked disastrous, such as alcohol addiction and teen pregnancy, became life-affirming milestones. Her stories reveal a hard-won wisdom that will help you, too, see the good everywhere and find divinity and guidance within." />
