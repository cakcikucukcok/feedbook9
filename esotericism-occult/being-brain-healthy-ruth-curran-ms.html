  <title>Being Brain Healthy - Ruth Curran Ms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The journey to wellness when coming back from a brain injury can be a long one. It is one that author Ruth Curran knows well. Faced with a myriad of challenges after her own brain injury, she decided to turn up the volume on the things that she loved and found ways to work through the discomfort and discouragement that can plague so many who are faced with this devastating diagnosis. Her own path  one that took 18 months  is one that she shares with readers in Being Brain Healthy. 
Being Brain Healthy is a book of hope not only for those who had a brain injury but also for anyone who wants to think better. Curran shares insights on healing with readers and has the unique ability to explain complex neuroscience in a way that makes sense to even those who are just taking their first steps on the road to recovery. Convinced that everyone can work their way out of what Curran refers to as the fog and can build better thinking skills, the author shares how she turned her entire life into a better experience.
The goal of Being Brain Healthy is to combine the most cutting edge research with what works in practice and fits in daily life. Curran helps readers to understand how the brain and body work together and how that can be used to an advantage. Divided into sections, including Be Active, Be Engaged, Be Social, Be Purposeful and Be Complicated, readers will be able to see how the newest science, activities and exercises can help those with thinking challenges to make the most of every day. Included in the book are stories from those currently in recovery from brain challenges whose experiences are meant to inspire readers to take their own functionality to the next level." />
