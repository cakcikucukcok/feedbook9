  <title>Who Am I? What Am I? Why Am I Here? - Geoffrey Barraclough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your fate, your destiny, your inner energy vibrations has led you to this life-changing book. As you peruse this cover and try to decide whether this information is for you or not, at this moment in time, the decision has already been made. If you are ready, you will read it; if you are not yet ready, you will put it down unread. As one day you may find out, there are no flukes in your life; everything that happens to you is predetermined, is for a purpose. Of course, you unconsciously cause things to happen in one way or another, by your actions, reactions, or nonactions. But nothing ever happens by random accident. Your life is full of limitless potentials that are restricted only by your mind-set. So now you are here, do you read this book or not? Whatever path you are currently on will answer that question for you, no need to cogitate over the choice. Simply trust your innate feelings right now and go with them, and whatever you chose to do was meant to be at this point in your current life experience." />
