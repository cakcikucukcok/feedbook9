  <title>The Mermaid’S Tail - Sophia Delaat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Mermaids Tail tells the story of the Universal Feminines emergence in history of humanity as a viable force in evolution. The soul qualities of compassion and regard for all human beings are what is demanding the redefinition of societys biggest questions. Without an equal voice in the debate about war, education, care for the land or the elderly, only part of the problem can be understood.&lt;br&gt;
Sophia takes the reader from the mythological to an awakened imagination that can define what the Feminine voice really is. Her love of different cultures and ability to synthesize experience creates a series of impressions that illuminate what at first glance may appear as mundane. She shares hard-won insights into the sacredness of the many expressions of a One god. Initially, what can be read as irreverence exposes a greater truth reserved only for the courageous.&lt;br&gt;
The Mermaids Tail unmasks hidden meanings of the tales we were told as childrenthe mythology buried deep in the recesses of our minds. The book offers unexpected and delightful insights into creating deeper personal meaning, all tied together with well-crafted, often poetic, prose. A delightful and very rewarding read.&lt;br&gt;

Best-selling author Pioneer in brain/mind research www.BuildMindPower.com This book will awaken feelings, joys, fears and emotions in readers from all walks of life, both masculine &amp; feminine, young &amp; old well done !&lt;br&gt;
- Gary Duncan wood worker, musician, landscape artist, Ozark Renaissance man&lt;br&gt;
The Mermaids Tail links visions of our universal subconscious past to what our collective conscious is asking for today. Drawing from her lifes journey and discoveries, Sophia has created an artful and enlightening read.&lt;br&gt;
