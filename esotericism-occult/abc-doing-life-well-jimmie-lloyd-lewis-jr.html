  <title>Abc: Doing Life Well - Jimmie Lloyd Lewis Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Times are changing, and so are our relationships with God. For many of us, it may be difficult to develop a deep spiritual relationship with God and live the way he intended within the framework of old methods.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;ABC: Doing Life Well&lt;/i&gt;, author Jimmie Lloyd Lewis Jr. shares his revitalized new method of letting go of guilt and other negative emotions that may be keeping you from God. Rather than focusing on how to reach God, Lewis teaches how to reach God by focusing on you. Whether your trouble is guilt, judgment, or confusion, this guide explains how to deal with the issues that stand between you and the Almighty. Through acceptance and healing, Lewis shows that we can recover from anything and meet our spiritual potential to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youve been struggling within the guidelines of antiquity to meet your spiritual potentials, perhaps its time to try a new approach. Developing a meaningful relationship with God could be as easy as ABC.&lt;/p&gt;" />
