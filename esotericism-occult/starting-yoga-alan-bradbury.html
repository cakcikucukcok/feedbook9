  <title>Starting Yoga - Alan Bradbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you are a complete beginner or have tried yoga in the past and wish to rekindle your interest, this invaluable, beautifully-illustrated book is the one for you. We all want to feel good about ourselves and yoga provides a way of realising our potential so that we can enjoy a full life. To be fit in body, steady in mind and strong in spirit are all attributes that build self-confidence and the inner strength to cope with all complexities of life. It is the author&#39;s firm belief that the practice of yoga has a subtle influence on improving the quality of our lives. In Starting Yoga, the author, Alan Bradbury, in his gentle and elegant way, invites you to take up the challenge of yoga and to see where it takes you. He presents a step-by-step guide to classical yoga postures and individual chapters cover getting started, good posture, standing and seated poses, and backbends and twists. Other chapters teach you how to relax, how to breathe efficiently and how to incorporate the bandhas [the chin lock, the root lock and the stomach lift] in order to help eliminate the obstacles to that &#39;feel-good factor&#39; we all search for. As you become fitter, stronger and more alive you will come to understand some of the nuances that make yoga so special. &quot;This book achieves the correct balance between the beginner&#39;s need for simplicity, clarity and guidance and the need for accessibility and loyalty to the traditional philosophical elements of yoga.&quot; Dr Alberto Albeniz, Consultant Psychiatrist" />
