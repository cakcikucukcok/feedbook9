  <title>The Inner Connection - Darlene Dawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you searching for your Higher Power?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you embrace spiritual ideals that are difficult to attain or maintain?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If so, this book is for you!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After over twenty-five years in recovery, Darlene Dawn understands what it takes to build a new life after addiction. Dawn is neither a guru nor an expert, but as someone who understands the necessity of maintaining your spiritual condition, she has decided to share her story. With help, she rose up from the depths of active addiction to ascend to the heights of her new life in recovery.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Shes doing it, and so can you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dawn details the mental and emotional shifts she experienced following a spontaneous out-of-body experience (OBE) when she was nine years clean and sober. Her OBE provided the impetus for spiritual and metaphysical study, the practical application of which is outlined in this book.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;i&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/i&gt;, Dawn developed a friendship with an intuitive who communicated with a nonphysical being of Light. During these life-changing sessions, Dawn acted as record keeper as this thought-provoking, nonphysical teacher radiated a powerful, loving energy and answered questions that enhanced Dawns spiritual understanding. &lt;i&gt;The Inner Connection&lt;/i&gt; is written as a guide to help you find your own answers; it is not meant to be the source of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The authors personal experience, combined with lessons from a being of Light, makes &lt;i&gt;The Inner Connection&lt;/i&gt; a primer for anyone who wishes to develop emotional freedom through spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
