  <title>A Year on Your Path to Growth - Keri Nola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMAGINE A DAY WHERE YOU:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Remember your infinite worth, no matter what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Reconnect with your Divine Authentic Self and be inspired to move forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Become confident in your ability to deal with your sufferings and experience peace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can happen and the possibility starts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to move forward, but feel lost and stuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you wonder what your own purpose truly is on this earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I understand. Ive been there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know what its like to feel anxious and depressed wondering what the purpose of such pain is, and then to search for happiness in a world that has such suffering. After a dear friend of mine died tragically, I deepened my search for the meaning of my own life while grieving the loss of hers. Since then, I have been on a journey to peace that has taken me to great perspectives, a journey that has changed my life, and a journey that has the potential to change yours as well. Together, lets release your questions and fears and reconnect you with your divine birthrights of love, joy, and abundance for authenticity and happiness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Year on Your Path to Growth&lt;/i&gt;: Daily Inspirations to Reconnect with Your Soul, Licensed Mental Health Counselor, Keri Nola, provides the daily compassion and comfort you yearn for and deserve, while inspiring you to reconnect with your authentic self. Her real life experience paired with her exceptional education and professional background has guided her along a meaningful path to understanding - one she desires to share with you. Ultimately, this year long journey of paradigm shifting inspiration will bring you the one thing you desire most - peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
