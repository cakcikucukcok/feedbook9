  <title>Without the Gazing Mirror - Author M</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book talks about the universal truth, unfolding the changing desires. When getting high meant being on a swing or bunking a class, smoking a cigarette in the school toilet, or kissing your first crush, a time when Dad was the only hero, when love was Mums hug, when Dads shoulder was the highest place on earth and your worst enemies were your siblings, when the only thing that could hurt you, were wounded knees, when the only things broken were toys, not hearts, and goodbyes meant only till tomorrow The Author has beautifully shared the difference between Love, which is forever, and the feeling of love which is short-lived. 
Melissa was reborn and her brain was not formatted, she clearly remembered her last life. A change of direction in both her lives causes echoes. Her search began to explore her karmic connection without the gazing mirror. Her, unfulfilled desires make her a lost soul, she discovers LIFE is a game we play with ourself and &#39;Time&#39; is beyond our control!" />
