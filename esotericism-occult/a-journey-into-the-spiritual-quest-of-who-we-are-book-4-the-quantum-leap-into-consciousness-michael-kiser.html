  <title>A Journey Into The Spiritual Quest of Who We Are: Book 4 - The Quantum Leap Into Consciousness - Michael Kiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within this fourth and final installment of this series, Kiazer delves deeper into the unknown and the known. This journey continues to remove illusions, as Kiazer goes ever deeper into the realms of the Ancient Beings. He teaches the world a much wider view of life and of learning of who we are, a reawakening of knowledge that lies dormant within all of us. We need to enter into a quantum leap of consciousness moving out of our 3rd dimensional life towards the 4th and 5th dimensional existence and as the earth makes her leap into her next dimensional existence, the sixth dimension. This is our next Cycle of our existence, a cycle that cannot be avoidable any longer. Look forward to a new upcoming series as Kiazer continue his journey, one which explains why we are who we are. You will be surprised." />
