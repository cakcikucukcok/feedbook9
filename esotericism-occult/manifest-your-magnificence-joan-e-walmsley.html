  <title>Manifest Your Magnificence - Joan E. Walmsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the synthesis currently occurring between science and metaphysics that reveals the energetic nature of all life and the amazing truth behind physical reality. It discusses the relationship between energy and consciousness, and how management of your own energy signature can change your reality and even your physical body. It demonstrates how you can connect to the immense energy available at the higher frequencies of your own being to manifest abundance, love, and peace for yourself, your family, your business, your community, and your world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book brings together energetic science and universal spiritual intelligence in a way that is understandable and practical. If you are ready to take responsibility for your life and manifest your own magnificence, this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan T. Howson, MA, CPCC, PCC, CHBC, founder of Magnificent Creations Limitee and Kids Coaching Connection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very current description of where science is in relation to the deeper wisdom of spiritual writings and teachings. It is a book for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Nelson MA, PhD, founder of Rocky Mountain Pathwork&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical exercises give us a chance to feel the energy surging through us and around us. I hope many people get a chance to read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Newby, MBA, director of InTouch Insight Systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptionally well written, organized and presented, &quot;Manifest Your Magnificence: The Energetics of Being&quot; is an inherently thoughtful and thought-provoking read that might well provide a life changing experience and is very highly recommended for both community and academic library collections. It should be noted for personal self-help, self-improvement reading lists that &quot;Manifest Your Magnificence&quot; is also available in a paperback edition (9781504341035, $24.99).&lt;/p&gt;
