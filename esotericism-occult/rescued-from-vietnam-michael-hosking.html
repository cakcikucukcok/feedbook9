  <title>Rescued from Vietnam - Michael Hosking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following his service as an Intelligence Infantryman with the Australian Army, Michael Hosking relates his engrossing journey of recovery from PTSD. Honouring the valour of the original 7th Battalion, he recounts his experiences during the Vietnam War and pays homage to the brave who fell in many battles.
The narrative includes his early years during a colourful, larrikin youth, and how the Army plucked him from civilian life, trained him to fight, and sent him sailing to Vietnam on the great adventure. But he discovers confusion, fear, and resentment in Vietnam, as he survives the jungle and enjoys mateship, but fights internal struggles, pain, and guilt over the war.
Troubles upon returning home are myriad, death and grief follow him, and seeking peace, he journeys overseas to recover his identity, make sense of life, and be released from the effects of PTSD.
Humorous adventures unfold across Europe and east along the Hippie Trail through Central Asia, where intriguing and gradual recovery from PTSD takes place in his heart. His spiritual journey of discovery, release, and outreach includes life-changing travels to impoverished African countries." />
