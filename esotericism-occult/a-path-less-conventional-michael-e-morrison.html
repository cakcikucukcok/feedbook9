  <title>A Path Less Conventional - Michael E Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a person born with cystic fibrosis, though not defined by his illness, Michael E Morrison knows better than most how Western medicine works. In the midst of his daily, very painful treatments, not surprisingly he found himself asking, Is Western medicine the best way forward? In this well researched and detailed exploration of alternative medicine, Morrison looks at the work of Joo de Deus at the Casa de Dom Incio in Brazil; the method and benefits of Buteyko breathing; the use of energy medicine; the importance of nutrition; and the use of emotional freedom techniques (EFT)as well as other alternative treatments. He compares the results of Western medicine to those of alternative therapies and finds that, often, getting back to nature and listening to our bodies can be the best way forward in leading a healthy, fulfilled life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
