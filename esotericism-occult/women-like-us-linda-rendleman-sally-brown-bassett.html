  <title>Women Like Us - Linda Rendleman, Sally Brown Bassett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sharing the value of a positive attitude in overcoming challenges and the importance of giving back, Women Like Us: Illuminating the World presents a collection of narratives about women from around the world who have changed their lives and the lives of others through their service and dedication.
Women Like Us tells the stories of Deb Carlson of rural Alaska, who chose a life of hand-built structures, gardening, hiking, and living minimally while doing her part to develop her community; of Toni Lusk, a trailing corporate wife who found a way to make a difference and to give back despite moving often; and of Linda Groveronce a child of foster care, now a woman on a mission to create change in the system. 
Authors Linda Rendleman and Sally Brown Bassett salute and celebrate life-changing women by sharing a variety of uplifting vignettes, such as the journey of one woman who moved to Uganda and started a birthing center to support mothers with AIDS and another who helped to build a school in a Kenyan village. The messages communicated in Women Like Us serve to inspire and motivate women to find their passion, put purpose to that passion, contribute to creating a better world, and transform their own lives." />
