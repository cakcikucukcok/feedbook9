  <title>Tales of Elevation - Mitch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Remember your senior year of high school and the beginning of college? If you grew up in the sixties, its all right if the answer is no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitcha contemporary student who idolizes that time period and participates in many of the same practices as those who really lived during the sixties counter-culture eravividly remembers his transition into this world. What started out as an alternative senior project (one that could never be passed in, of course) has evolved into this recollection of thoughts, trials, and times. Mitchs experiences are shared in a totally unorthodox way, playing with journalistic, analytic, and humoristic styles. &lt;i&gt;Tales of Elevation&lt;/i&gt; is focused on, inspired by, and essentially produced by one particularly elevating substance, marijuana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the clichs that surround marijuana and those who appreciate it, &lt;i&gt;Tales of Elevation&lt;/i&gt; does not preach or advocate anything. Rather, it provides a firsthand reflection of the ways Mitch and others think, feel, and behave while elevated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tales of Elevation&lt;/i&gt; gives a glimpse into another realm, where music is one of the main religions and high times with good vibes keep the ship going. Those who dabbled with it can definitely dig what goes on in this state. For anyone whos wondered what its like, &lt;i&gt;Tales&lt;/i&gt; offers a glimpse of how marijuana can affect you and those around you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
