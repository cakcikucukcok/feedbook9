  <title>The secret of ka - Freddy Ramoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book lifts the veil on the meaning of an ancient initiatory symbol of Ancient Egypt, it is the ka, generally represented by the hands raised above the head, as indicated by the Statue of the ka of king Hor ( XIIIth dynasty) currently kept at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo as illustrated on the first cover of this book.
Ka symbolizes an invisible part of the human being which once developed by the practices confer on the initiate enormous spiritual powers. The man who manages to awaken the energy of ka in its totality can live in the light and the eternal wisdom. The fear of death will no longer paralyze him, in that death for him will only be a door to another dimension, a continuity towards a brighter life.
By the spiritual knowledge it contains, this book is indicated for people who are eager to understand the nature of one of the most powerful symbol of ancient Egyptian magic. Open this book to understand the reality of Ka, take a step towards this inner energy that stretches your arms, discover the meaning of an initiate symbol in this era of darkness. Learn about this energy that is inside of you that could make you a living star in the midst of the crowd of the uninitiated who populate the earth&#39;s surface.
This book is suitable for anyone wishing to discover some of the supreme wisdom of the highest initiates in ancient Egypt. Its content revolves around a central question: what is Ka?" />
