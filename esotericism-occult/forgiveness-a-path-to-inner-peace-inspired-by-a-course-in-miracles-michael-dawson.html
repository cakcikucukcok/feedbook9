  <title>Forgiveness: A Path to Inner Peace - Inspired by A Course in Miracles - Michael Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="True forgiveness asks us to stop pointing our finger at the people and events in the world as the cause of our pain, and turn instead to the unforgiven thoughts in our own minds. Here we can create change, which will lead to an ever-increasing sense of inner peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book outlines simple, practical steps and techniques we can use to help us in our efforts to learn and practise forgiveness with ourselves and others in our daily lives. Illustrative case histories and stories of forgiveness and healing are also included, as well as methods and approaches for helping others to forgive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book gives a clear framework for understanding the true nature of forgiveness, as well as discussing the implications for us when we do aspire to that path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In every situation in which we lose our peace we have found a reflection of what is unhealed within us, what we have not forgiven ourselves for. Our world is a reflection of our consciousness - life constantly reflecting back what is in our minds. So rather than getting upset when things aren&amp;#39;t going the way we would like, we can pause and use the techniques in this book to draw our attention to what is going on inside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the underlying philosophy is inspired by &amp;#39;A Course in Miracles&amp;#39;, this book is applicable to us all, and is readily understandable by those not familiar with the Course." />
