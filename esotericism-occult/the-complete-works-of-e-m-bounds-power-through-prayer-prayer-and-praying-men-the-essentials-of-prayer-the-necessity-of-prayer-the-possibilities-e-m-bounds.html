  <title>The Complete Works of E. M. Bounds: Power Through Prayer, Prayer and Praying Men, The Essentials of Prayer, The Necessity of Prayer, The Possibilities - E. M. Bounds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Collected here in this 8-in-1 omnibus edition are all of E. M. Bounds&#39; powerful books. No one else wrote with such power and authority on prayer. These classic books continue to inspire and instruct us on all aspects of prayer and its uses in everyday Christian life. &quot;Prayer has to do with the entire man. Prayer takes in man in his whole being, mind, soul and body. It takes the whole man to pray, and prayer affects the entire man in its gracious results. As the whole nature of man enters into prayer, so also all that belongs to man is the beneficiary of prayer. All of man receives benefits in prayer. The whole man must be given to God in praying. The largest results in praying come to him who gives himself, all of himself, all that belongs to himself, to God. This is the secret of full consecration, and this is a condition of successful praying, and the sort of praying which brings the largest fruits.&quot; -E. M. Bounds" />
