  <title>Experience Victory in Life by Recognizing Your Enemy and Knowing Your God - Theresa Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you realize it or not, God&#39;s people are involved in a spiritual battle against the forces of darkness.  Satan has come as a thief To Steal, To Kill, &amp; To Destroy. God never intended for His people to be fearful of Satan, his demonic attacks, or threats.  Jesus death, burial, and resurrection gave believers victory over Satan and his demonic influences in their lives.  Through Jesus life&#39;s example we can cast out demons, rebuke Satan, and take authority over the powers of darkness.  God has equipped every believer with all the necessary weapons and armor to defeat the enemy.  I admonish you to discover the truth through God&#39;s word and begin to declare the word over your life so that every chain of bondage, generational curse, bad habit(s), and old mind-sets can be broken off your life." />
