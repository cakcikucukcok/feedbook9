  <title>Refreshed in His Spirit - Stephanie Gurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stephanie Gurley shares her story of living a self-absorbed life while trying to acquire her dreams. To acquire those dreams would require running a race daily as a wife and mother. Nearly at hand, her dream became her survival, as she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. God offered her the ultimate race to run in, a race that was intended for all to participate in. It was a race that took her far to overcome insecurity, wounds, and fears, as God transformed her prideful, hardened heart into moldable clay. It was a heart that began to desire the Word of the Lord and every morsel it had to offer. It was a heart that ultimately became refreshed in His spirit, leading her to the calling of writing this book. She obeyed the Lord. She was not to let her testimony sit on a shelf at home. 
She says, Obedience is what matters.
Come with Stephanie to see some of the things God has shown her. You can begin your journey crossing one stepping stone at a time, whether it is in your spiritual walk, personal walk, or a ministry.  It is her prayer that you will be led to become refreshed in His spirit! Grab hold of the seeds along the way, and begin to bloom." />
