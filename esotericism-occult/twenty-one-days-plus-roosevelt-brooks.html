  <title>Twenty-One Days-Plus - Roosevelt Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one Days-Plus offers a way for anyone to identify areas in their lives that they need and are willing to improve. Twenty-one Days-Plus can  help you in selecting doable steps that lead to behavior and life style modifications that get you closer to your goals, and that lead to self-discovery. Within the pages of this book, you will find techniques that aid you in starting and completing any personal growth journey.  The book also explores the spiritual journey that takes us closer to God, as well as the journeys to find purpose, meaning, balance and wholeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how many of us have thoughts turning in our heads, that make us believe if we wait long enough, a hero will show up to save us.  That belief generates a mindset that causes us to give away our power to make a difference, and it diminishes our ability to see ourselves as part of the solution.  As we wait for someone else to save the day, we may lose our hope and sink into the bowels of disparity, which darkens our outlook on life and chips away at our self-esteem.  It is extremely hard to see the hero-within when we only look for him or her outside of ourselves. There is nothing wrong with waiting for a hero to come along.  However, it would be wise to let go of the expectation that someone other than ourselves will make us happy, or rescue us from the plights we face. Personal change requires personal commitment and only the hero-within you can make that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
