Using poems from her poetic journal, letters to her healing circle, and conversations with Spirit, Margaret takes the reader through a dark night of the soul and into the light beyond. This is about living deeply, healing body, mind, emotions, and spirit. She has already inspired many people to make positive life changes. Sometimes funny, always honest, graceful, and full of hope, this powerful, life-affirming book is particularly relevant in these troubled times.&lt;p&gt;

From &quot;The South China Morning Post&quot; ( Hong Kong)  May, 2006, beginning of an article on integrative healing:&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Many Ways to Get Over the Dark Days&lt;p&gt;
When Margaret Dubay Mikusauthor of the book As Easy As Breathing, the story of her struggle and triumph over cancerwas diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, her first reaction was one of fear. She had just recovered from multiple sclerosis the year before and felt betrayed and abandoned by the news, calling it the dark night of her soul. Armed with the experience from her earlier multiple sclerosis healing process, Mikus integrated conventional treatment with her own mix of holistic therapies, including yoga, hypnotherapy, reiki, expression through poetry, and jokes, backrubs and hugs with her children.She attended seminars on healing, formed a healing circle with family and friends, ate healthy foods and exercised. Mikus eventually healed from the cancer and now dedicated herself to helping others discover their full possibilities for life....   Eileen Lian, reporter&quot;" />
