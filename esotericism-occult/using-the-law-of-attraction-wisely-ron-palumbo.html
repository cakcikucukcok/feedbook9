  <title>Using the Law of Attraction Wisely - Ron Palumbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For over 25 years Ron has facilitated what many former attendees call the most powerful workshop ever. This book is a result of the many attendees whove asked, Where can I buy your book? Finally, our Using the Law of Attraction WISELY Workshop is in print.
Do the work... your life improves! There are NO EXCEPTIONS!
(This has been our guarantee for over 25 years).
Apply the tools in this book to remove the BAD PROGRAMMING (the garbage) in your subconscious mind.  Your energy becomes more focused and you are more empowered.  Empowered people are more effective in their work. Their relationships are enhanced.  Their lives improve as all life areas flow more beautifully and more harmoniously.    
A Dallas woman wrote that her sales had been in the mid-70s prior to attending your workshop. but after attending your workshop and applying the techniques, my sales skyrocketed to 98%... and have been in the 90s ever since.  
She went on to become the Top Salesperson in her company that year, and was awarded a NEW CAR.
After experiencing a major healing, a Sacramento woman said, Ron, had I not attended your workshop I would have called this a miracle but because I attended your workshop, I kind of thought something like this might happen." />
