  <title>A Metamorphosis of the Soul - C J Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the spirit, I felt my great-grandma Thalias presence that night.  I had received an opportunity to visit a chapter in my familys past and to take my son with me.  My parents always taught me that you must know your history to understand where youre going (or possibly where you dont want to go back to).  On this occasion, I was able to help him see the relevance of his past to the present, and to look beyond the present to the unlimited potential of the future.  My soul was lifted, and I had a divine assurance that the legacy of documenting, preserving, and telling our familys history would not be lost to the winds of time. That evening, one of our children paused to look back with me and to set his compass for a good course into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an amazing level of transparency, C. J. Brown provides a well-written book that allows us to witness her personal triumph over tragedy.  &lt;em&gt;A Metamorphosis of the Soul&lt;/em&gt; invites readers to examine their own faith journey as the author displays the power of God in her spiritual journey.&lt;br /&gt;
