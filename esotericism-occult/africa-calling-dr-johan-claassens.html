  <title>Africa Calling - Dr. Johan Claassens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Africa is well known for its diversity in people and also in Traditional Healing. As an African Shaman, psychic, spiritual healer and psychic surgeon there is not much that I have not seen and experienced in Africa. From the darkest of evil work to the most beautiful work in Gods name. The contradiction in ways of the people of Africa will surprise the most hardened spiritualist. My journey has been nothing short of incredible. My services to clear evil and negativity around people and their homes stretches all over Africa and neighbouring countries for Kings, high level government officials and politicians. Africa is overflowing with witchcraft, evil spirits and bad medicine (muthi). To this day I still dont understand why a white man was called by spirit to work in this frightening environment of darkness. I am now classified as a Isanuse, a teacher of teachers, a title bestowed on no other white Shaman in Africa. I will leave my footprints embedded in my Africa forever, my children and their children will read about my journeys in many years to come. 
My Africa, my beautiful mistress of hills and rivers, Where the lion calls at dusk and the elephant move like spirits through the night Aaaaaiii, my Africa, how you make my heart beat." />
