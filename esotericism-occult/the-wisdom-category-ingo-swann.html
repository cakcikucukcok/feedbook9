  <title>The Wisdom Category - Ingo Swann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE REALITY OF INNATE HUMAN WISDOM-MAKING&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this sensitive work, Ingo Swann once more opens up the continuing story of the fuller extent of human consciousness, which, by many accounts, is amazing and intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These accounts are found in all cultures ranging from ancient to contemporary, and the sum of them more than suggests that humans plus their innate consciousness are designed for a much richer and astonishing existence than what most societal programs encourage or permit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The nexus, or connected group, of the discussions in this book turns on only two interactive questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is human consciousness designed for self-destruction?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OR&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it designed to continuously sustain its own pro-survival into futurity?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many categories within human consciousness that work to sustain pro-survival. But all of them can be affiliated with one central heading: WISDOM, without which our species could not have survived anything, even itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
