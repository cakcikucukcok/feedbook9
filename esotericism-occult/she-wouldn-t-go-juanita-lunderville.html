  <title>She Wouldn’T Go! - Juanita Lunderville.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based upon true events, She Wouldn&#39;t Go! The Haunting is the story of Janie and her struggles with one unforgettable spirit. When Janie was young, she was taught how to read the Tarot Cards by her Grandma Vicky, who possessed special knowledge of the spirit world. Her grandmother tells her that she is teaching Janie about the cards because she is special; only later will Janie understand how important this is for her. Janie is aware there is something different about her because she has begun to have premonitions and bad dreams of things to come.
When Janie grows up, she meets and falls in love with Bobby; they marry. As most young couples do, they buy their very first home. As they move in, it&#39;s an exciting time for them; soon, they learn that they will be adding a child to their family. They are overjoyed with this news and know that theirs will be a happy home. 
But once their son, Edward, is born, strange things begin to happen in their home. They soon discover there is a very persistent spirit in their home-the spirit of a young girl who wants to take the place of their son because she is enthralled by Edward&#39;s mother&#39;s love for him. She wants that love-but what might it cost Janie and her family?" />
