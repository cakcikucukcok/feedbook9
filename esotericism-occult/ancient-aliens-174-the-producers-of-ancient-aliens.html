With a foreword by Series Creator, Kevin Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings. What if it were true? And if so, what if there were clues left behind?

Filled with exciting insights and behind-the scenes stories from the show&amp;#8217;s creators and leading experts in ancient alien theory, the book explores the key questions at the heart of the series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who were they?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did they come?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What did they leave behind?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where did they go?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will they return?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transporting readers around the globe, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#174; explores the fascinating enigmas and mysterious artifacts our ancestors left behind, from incredible objects to amazingly accurate ancient maps; from the Great Pyramid of Giza and stone megaliths at Gobekli Tepe to the Nazca Plains and mysterious structures of Puma Punku. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanied by lavish 4-color photography throughout, the book allows armchair archaeologists to examine the evidence up close for the first time. Both the ultimate-fan book and the perfect gift for readers new to the show, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Aliens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#174; is a compelling journey through the mysteries of our ancient civilizations and the possibility of alien influence on our cultures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
