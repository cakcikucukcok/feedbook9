  <title>Life …There&#39;s an App for That - Jw Festini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written in the form of a technical manual, the book shares the authors thoughts and personal experience in a relaxed and conversational manner, easily understood by young people today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are children, we are filled with imagination, but as we get older, we lose the ability to dream. How many times have we heard well-meaning adults tell us Stop daydreaming and get to work. For most people, this leads to an unfulfilled life, and questions like Why am I here? or Where am I going? are either asked too late or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book likens our life journey to the apps that are installed on computers. The well-worn phrase Theres an app for that inspired the author to imagine what it would be like if we could create apps for our life. This is a modern self-help book also based in reality. The author shares how he and others weathered the Great Recession and other obstacles with the help of the Starting Over app.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In order to help guide the reader toward a more fulfilling life, the question Why am I here? is answered. We are here to leave a legacy for those who follow. This frees the reader up to pursue a meaningful life on the way to powering down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
