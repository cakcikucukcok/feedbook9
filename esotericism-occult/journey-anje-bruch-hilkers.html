  <title>Journey - Anje Bruch-Hilkers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Follow Anje on her journey from the diagnosis of breast cancer to health. Find courage in every line and humor in every chapter when she relates her confusion and her victories. It is a journey, not a war; Anje refuses to say she is fighting her cancer, instead she sees it as something that came on to her path and is part of herself to have and to let go. Mindfully, she takes time, together with her husband Rob, to choose all treatments carefully, even if, sometimes, that means changing her mind several times. &lt;br /&gt;
Whatever your connection to cancer whether you or a loved one either has or had cancer; whether you have lost family or friends or are yourself now living with cancerJourney will give you laughter, sober truths, and warm encounters. It might even change the way you see cancer in the most human of ways.&lt;br /&gt;
Anje shows us her way to find direction from the human spirit as she struggled with making choices from conflicting opinions about the best way to survive the cancer that threatened her. She found peace of mind and likely her sanity from the wee small voice within that demanded to be heard above the roar of professional advice. No doubt this will influence others and give them courage to weigh their medical options carefully with the full knowledge of their own life-affirming guidance.Bill MacKay, Author&lt;br /&gt;
These writings are windows into a life lived fully, with curiosity and courage. With language that is at once vivid, spare, and evocative, Anje draws the reader into her unique experiences and her unique passage through these experiences. Sometimes serious, often funny, occasionally dark, this small and powerful book will not be put down.Claire Sylvan, B.A., Poet, Author of Turnings" />
