  <title>Jesus the Master Builder - Gordon Strachan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus the Master Builder kept me up all night. Few books have that power.&#39; -- Jonathan Glancey, The Guardian Did Jesus visit Britain? The activities of Jesus before the start of his ministry at the age of thirty have been the subject of much speculation. Did he travel beyond the bounds of Palestine in his search for wisdom knowledge? Where did he acquire the great learning which amazed those who heard him preaching and enabled him to cross swords in debate with Scribes and Pharisees? A number of legends suggest that Jesus travelled to the British Isles with Joseph of Arimathea, who worked in the tin trade. With these legends as his starting point, Gordon Strachan uncovers a fascinating network of connections between the Celtic world and Mediterranean culture and philosophy. Taking the biblical image of Wisdom as the &#39;master craftsman&#39;, Strachan explores the deep layers of Mystery knowledge shared between the Judaic-Hellenic world and the northern Druids -- from the secret geometry of masons and builders, which Jesus would have encountered in his work as a craftsman in Palestine, to the Gematria or number coding of the Old and New Testaments. This book is the basis of the film documentary &#39;And Did Those Feet&#39;.Jesus the Master Builder kept me up all night.
