  <title>Kremansk Prophecy - Dragoljub Golubovic, Dejan Malenkovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The intent and purpose of this book is to successfully gather and present the authentic messages of the two Kremansk prophets, Milosh and Mitar Tarabic, as they told them.  
&lt;p&gt;Born in a remote mountain village of Kremno, beneath the mountain Tara, these two humble illiterate peasants had practically no elementary knowledge of history or geography.  They were nevertheless able to foretell all the important events occurring in the nineteenth century during which they lived, as well as events not occurring until the twentieth century.  They also had messages pertaining to the events that are yet to happen in the distant future.  They didn&#39;t speak in riddles as other prophets did.  They never made it a dilemma about what would happen, or even when or how. Their messages were timely, precise and chronologically correct.
&lt;p&gt;The Tarabics received their messages from an unknown source. Their Godfather, the priest, Zachary Zacharic, preserved them by writing them down.  The process was long and tedious and it took years to gather them.  The manuscripts had originally been hidden and were finally uncovered and compiled by Father Zachary&#39;s grandson, Dejan Malenkovic with whose help this book was finally written.   
&lt;p&gt;Even though this book deals with unusual and fascinating events, the authors are not attempting to explain them, nor are they discussing man&#39;s secret and unusual, supernatural knowledge.  As non-scientists we are not capable of explaining something that mankind has not been able to explain since the age of antiquity.  We just wrote what we found and time will tell whether a phenomenon scientifically unexplainable is also nonexistent." />
