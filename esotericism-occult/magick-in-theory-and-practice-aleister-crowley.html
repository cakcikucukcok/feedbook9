  <title>MAGICK in THEORY and PRACTICE - Aleister Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aleister Crowley was a noted and controversial occultist, ceremonial magician and poet. He has been called &amp;quot;the wickedest man in the world&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;or &amp;quot;The Great Beast 666 &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Master Therion&amp;quot; but he remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counterculture. This book is considered to be the foremost book on ceremonial magic written in the twentieth century and is recommended to initiates. This is a valuable book to anyone interested in occult studies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt&lt;/b&gt;: &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;This book is for ALL: for every man, woman, and child.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;My former work has been misunderstood, and its scope limited, by my use of technical terms. It has attracted only too many dilettanti and eccentrics, weaklings seeking in &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; an escape from reality. I myself was first consciously drawn to the subject in this way. And it has repelled only too many scientific and practical minds, such as I most designed to influence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But MAGICK is for ALL.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;" />
