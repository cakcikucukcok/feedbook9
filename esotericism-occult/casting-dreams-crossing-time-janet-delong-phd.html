  <title>Casting Dreams  Crossing Time - Janet DeLong Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Standing Bear and I met again for the first time in the 1980s. To say he changed my world would be the biggest understatement of my life. He, and his shamanic ways, sent amazing waves through my universe. I wrote Casting DreamsCrossing Time, my remembering of our story, in 2000.
What took so long to release this book? The three of me could explain . . . Janet would tell you I had to finish living it. Dr. Jan would tell you that timing is everything. And Auntie Jan would wax my truth poetically, Ah, twill be midnight rising 2015 when that clock will chime. I can publish this book now because it is our truth, way back when and even then. Bear and I really did and did really cast our dreams and cross our time." />
