  <title>Summit Life Today - Dave McAuley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summit Life Today is designed to give you fresh insights each day. The principles, quotes, and Scripture passages that make up each Summit Life Today lesson are also designed for you to apply that very day. Reading and sharing these principles with your team will help you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;improve your daily practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;find encouragement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be inspired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;engage in meaningful dialogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practical leadership lessons will lift you as a leader and help you gain insight from a summit perspective as you chart your path for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things are true of all leaders: leaders are learners, and leaders want to help other people. Summit Life Today is a learning tool that not only grows you as a leader but also gives you lessons you can use to help others on your team. When you grow yourself and grow your team, you are expanding your leadership capacity and increasing the reach of your influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right connections are necessary for effective leadership. As a Christian leader, in whatever platform of influence God has placed you, your responsibility is to align the individual talent on your team toward a collective and unified purpose. Well-connected teams working together toward a common goal are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
