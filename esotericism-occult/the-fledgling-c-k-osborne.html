  <title>The Fledgling - C. K. Osborne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imperial China in 5BC was a divided country where belief in religions; mysticism and politics were interwoven together. 
10 year old Su Ling, growing up in poor surroundings was soon to discover that the honour bestowed on her by her parents meant abandonment to the work-rooms of the local Grand Administrator in his vast complex of buildings.
In the workhouse, the disciplined lifestyle required stamina and sacrifice. She was later transferred to The Temple of the Heavenly Bird where she was to become a chosen one for a secret esoteric group and educated in the ancient mysteries.
Through two traumatic episodes in her life, where the sense of loss overwhelmed her; there gradually came a transformation. The quiet obedient child became a fierce creature who felt betrayed by the group she had sworn an allegiance to. Her rage knew no bounds as she risked her own life by expressing her contempt for her Masters and colleagues alike.
After a supernatural disclosure about the torment she had suffered; there gradually came a sense of peace which enabled her to continue to carry out her duties helping to fight evil within the temple, and throughout the country beyond." />
