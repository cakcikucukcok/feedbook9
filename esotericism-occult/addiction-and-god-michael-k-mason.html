  <title>Addiction and God - Michael K. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The roots of the modern disease theory of addiction can be traced back to the archaic medical philosophies of the eighteenth century. This popular theory is based primarily on the assumption that so-called addicts are physically unable to resist the call of addictive chemicals. They are presumably stricken from birth with this unlucky condition and all but helpless in the fight against the unhealthy symptoms of the so-called disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that contemporary addiction research shows that substance abusers are not genetically or biologically different from anyone else. In fact, a growing group of physicians and researchers contend that addicts are simply guilty of making self-destructive choices in response to the commonplace stresses of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When addicts begin to take responsibility for their calculated chemical choices, they ultimately come to view their abusive behaviors in terms of not sickness but sin. They can then learn how to achieve forgiveness of their sins and deliverance from their addictions by offering their hearts, minds, and bodies to Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a skillfully written and powerful book about addiction and recovery. Having seen the devastating effects of addiction first hand, Mr. Mason was able to use his own personal experiences to develop a one of a kind text that dispels the myths about addiction and beautifully outlines the connection between the Spirit and recovery. After 14 years of working in the field of chemical dependency, I have never found a more complete and insightful view of addiction, recovery, and spirituality. &lt;/p&gt;
