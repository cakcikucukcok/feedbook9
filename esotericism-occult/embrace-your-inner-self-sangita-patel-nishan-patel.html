  <title>Embrace Your Inner Self - Sangita Patel, Nishan Patel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When we embrace our inner child, we awaken our natural ability to heal physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Many people do not realize their own power. &lt;br /&gt;I did not believe it for most of my lifetime either &lt;br /&gt;but once I had experienced it, I felt like I was reborn again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first 40 years of this circle of life, I was often a victim. I suffered pain and struggle to over come obstacles. I had so much anger, frustration, and sadness inside of me and toward the world. But now my life has changed. In The Journey Within &lt;br /&gt;I share with you my life journey and how my life was completely transformed in &lt;br /&gt;an instant starting with practicing Qigong and using other holistic tools with &lt;br /&gt;the healing power of love, forgiveness, and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all blessed with the natural ability to heal ourselves&lt;br /&gt;we can unlock this ability once we realize how to embrace our inner child. &lt;br /&gt;We just need to bring that awareness and learn how to use these simple and &lt;br /&gt;powerful tools in our daily life to shine our light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that this book will inspire people around the world &lt;br /&gt;to experience this complete guide to healing for themselves and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this book you will:&lt;br /&gt;-Regain your inner-peace and support awakening your inner-wisdom&lt;br /&gt;-Develop your own ability to Heal, Harmonize, and Organize your life&lt;br /&gt;-Create your own simple action plan to start seeing results&lt;/p&gt;
