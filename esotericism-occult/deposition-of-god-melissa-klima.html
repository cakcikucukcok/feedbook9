  <title>Deposition of God - Melissa Klima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever asked God a question and then actually heard him answer? I hadntthat is, until August 16, 2017, when Gods voice was so loud and so crystal clear that I had no doubt. 
As a professional court reporter, I take my job as the keeper of the record very seriously. Ive taken hundreds of depositions, and I was experiencing what we stenographers call deposition-burnout syndrome. I felt depressed and lacked a sense of purpose. 
I turned to God for answers. Take my deposition, God said. I argued back, No one has ever taken Gods deposition. Exactly, he replied. I stopped in my tracks. Oh my god, Im talking to God, I realized. Yes, you are, he said with a gentle laugh. But I can actually hear you this time, I added in shock and delight. Yes, you can, now go take my deposition, he encouraged. 
So I set up my writer and I began asking God the big questions, like Why are we here? What happens when we die? When does a soul enter the physical body? And he answered them all. Ive heard some wild testimony over the years, but Gods truth blew my mind. 
Its not some fluke that youre reading this right now; its meant to be. Your awareness is about to increase. The Deposition of God will empower you to know who you really are and why you are here." />
