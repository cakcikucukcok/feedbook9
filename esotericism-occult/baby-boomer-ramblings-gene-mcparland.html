  <title>Baby Boomer Ramblings - Gene McParland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What a gift life is! It comes ready to open every morning. Each day is totally unique. Each day can be a new adventure. It can be a source of joy, or of sorrow. It all depends on how we approach it. The secret to joyful living is learning to look at life through the eyes of a small child. As a bona fide baby boomer, I have lived a life filled with many joys and some regrets. Today I choose to live life in joy and with a sense of childlike wonderment. This book is a reflection on how to recapture the sense of wonder and joy we were born with. &lt;br /&gt;
This book is a collection of thoughts, ramblings, and experiences about our special gift of life. Baby Boomer Ramblings offers my thoughts, observations and suggestions, on living life in a more positive and happier way. All of this is wrapped around a poem, or more correctly, a poem wrapped around lifes gifts.&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I prefer to live life as a poem. Poetry adds magic to life. Its the minds and hearts way of expressing ones inner voice. That is what this book does. Unlike a textbook of life that one reads and studies, poetry is recited by ones mind and speaks to ones heart and spirit. &lt;br /&gt;
At the minimum, this book offers some food for thought on how to live in the moment. Learn how to live life with a sense of awe and childlike glee. As a baby boomer who has experienced around two-thirds of my life, Im finally at that stage where Ive finally got it. &lt;br /&gt;
Read this book and discover how to have contentment and laughter. Become a childlike poet of life and be forever young!" />
