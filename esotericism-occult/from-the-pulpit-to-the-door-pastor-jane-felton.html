  <title>From the Pulpit to the Door - Pastor Jane Felton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible warns all believers to beware of the wolf in sheeps clothing. But what do we do when it is the very shepherd of the flock who is endangering the sheep? What do we do when our very own pastors and church leaders are using their positions to deceive, abuse, and ruin the lives of children and vulnerable members of the church? 
In From the Pulpit to the Door, author and pastor Jane Felton shares her own sad but informative tale of dealing with the people who are supposed to take souls closer to Godbut who are in fact doing the opposite. Pastor Felton hopes to teach people to be aware of the signs of what can happen when a church leader is deceiving or harming the children in the church, and she implores fellow believers to remember that the Word of God tells us to watch as well as to pray.
So much of what is happening to vulnerable Christian youths can be eliminated if Christian parents remember to be more watchful of their children. While abuse by pastors and church leaders happens in many faiths and can often be covered up, God reveals all sins and will deliver justice for any who have been harmed by deceitful, abusive shepherds." />
