  <title>Sophia Geography: Exploring Spirituality, Landscape and Archetypes - Janice P Antill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;TELL ME YOUR LANDSCAPE and I will tell you who you are.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We are defined by our landscapes, as the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset said . Yet this book shows that it is the archetypes which are behind our landscapes , which permeate our values and inform our spirituality. These form our inner landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr J.P. Antill, a descendant of the Te Wai Pounamu landscape , the Greenstone South Island of New Zealand, was impelled after travels in Tibet and Northern India to undertake a personal quest to discover the spiritual meanings of landscapes. &amp;lsquo;Sophia Geography&amp;rsquo; is a journey of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious Studies is the academic discipline concerned with spirituality, religion and theology in its broadest sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Sophia Geography&amp;#39; approaches the spiritual inherent in landscapes from a secular point of view. Spirituality, landscape and archetypes are ideas which can be explored historically, analytically and descriptively, or phenomenologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Geography is an exploration . It is an academic quest for clarification and enlightenment on ideas about spirituality , landscape and archetypes - and finally it comes to a realization and explores the forgotten and hidden Gnostic Sophia. This is not a dogmatic book , but rather it is a phenomenological exploration. Everything is up for discussion and disagreement . Setting out, this writer did not know the destination. The conclusion , like a lost continent emerging out of the mist, was a rediscovery. Whether it is real , is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explored in this book are the following topics: History of Western Spirituality; Geography of Landscape, Place and Spirituality; Archetypal Psychology and Archetypal Landscapes; Paganism and Animism&amp;ndash; New Zealand Maori, American Indian and Australian Aborigine Primal Religions; Green Ecospirituality; Philosophy of Science and Spirituality; Postmodernism; Postmodern theology and science; Feminist and Ecofeminist theology; Gnosticism and Persian mysticism as interpreted by Henry Corbin; and the long lost Sophia &amp;ndash; philosophy of the Soul and the Soul of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seminal thinkers drawn on are: Carl Jung, Anthony Stevens, James Hillman, Walter A. Shelburne, Peter Bishop, Denis Cosgrove, Barry Lopez, Lynn Ross-Bryant, Edward C. Whitmont, Kathleen Granville Damiani, Carol P. Christ, Lloyd Geering, Thomas Berry, Charlene Spretnak, James Lovelock, Wolfgang Pauli, F. David Peat, David Bohm and Henry Corbin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone who has ever intuitively felt that the world we inhabit is a spiritual one, will be enlightened from beginning to end by &amp;lsquo;Sophia Geography&amp;rsquo;. With its strong line of argument and vast scope it opens up new vistas not just by the chapter but with each page turned. The end result is a hugely altered vision &amp;ndash; that humanity and the Earth share the same soul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Famularo , artist and Green activist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;sparks with insight, commitment and understanding&amp;hellip;it is a significant contribution to the field of large-scale archetypal synthesis, especially those which attempt to apply themselves to urgent and important social concerns&amp;hellip;the writer&amp;rsquo;s strength lies in her ability to synthesise and in her understanding of and empathy with the Sophianic perspective, particularly as articulated by Henri Corbin. The attempt to apply Corbin&amp;rsquo;s interpretation and exposition of Ibn &amp;lsquo;Arabi&amp;rsquo;s seminal work to the field of eco-poetics is both original and important. This is difficult work and is a profound challenge to dominant paradigms of understanding, perception and experience in most societies, not merely western&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Bishop, &amp;lsquo;The Myth of Shangri-La -- Tibet, Travel Writing and the Western Creation of Sacred Landscape&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
