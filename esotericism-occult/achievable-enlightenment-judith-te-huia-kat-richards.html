  <title>Achievable Enlightenment - Judith Te Huia, Kat Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grounded spiritual practice is a necessary part of working responsibly with spiritual and soul growth. Clearing, protection and grounding are the cornerstones of healthy spiritual, psychic and personal practice. They also have an impact on your everyday life, even if you are not following your spiritual path as yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pace of life speeding up all the time, the many signposts, guides and answers to our questions can be easily missed. Achievable Enlightenment gives you explanations and information on topics that can make a difference in your life. Grounded spiritual practice is a necessary part of working responsibly toward spiritual and soul growth and is the cornerstone of healthy psychic and personal practice. Clearing, protecting and grounding are ways to cleanse or reset your energy so that your experiences, moods and feelings are not controlled by outside influences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a combination of new knowledge and unique exercises, you can really embrace grounded spiritual practice. Your tests in life are part of a greater plan. Gaining insight into why you chose to incarnate can encourage you to make the most of your souls experience, optimizing your health for mind, body and spiritual living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wont be alone as Achievable Enlightenment invites you to bring your whole family along, with exercises especially for your children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
