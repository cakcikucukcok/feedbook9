  <title>Unveiling Final Jesus - Dean C. Knudsen</title>

Common logic would seem to dictate that a God who is intelligent, reasonable and articulate would speak last words that would be easily understood by the vast majority of His audience. Unfortunately, in the case of The Revelation, the reality is quite different. For most of the last two millennia of Church history, Christians have fussed and fought (metaphorically, if not physically) over the intent, intelligibility and interpretation of The Revelation. What was given as a source of encouragement, unity and hope has become a cause of discouragement, division and fear.&quot;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

These visions were not given to stir fear or confusion but to inspire hope and to give courage to a young Church - a Church that was struggling with the harsh realities of living according to the teachings of Christ in the midst of a decidedly non-Christian world. The author claims that Jesus is the focal point and central figure of this mysterious and final book of the Bible. In this manner, he seeks to make the message of Revelation relevant and reasonable to every reader.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
