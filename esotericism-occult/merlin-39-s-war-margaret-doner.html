  <title>Merlin&#39;s War - Margaret Doner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Merlins War: The Battle between the Family of Light and the Family of Dark&lt;/i&gt; examines the fact that the history of the human race has been manipulated by a being so clever that we have had no idea he exists. In fact, he has hidden behind Luciferbut Lucifer is not our devil. Much of what has been told to the human race has been designed to keep the truth at bay. Whose purpose did it serve to keep the human race unaware of its own origins and ignoring huge pieces of obvious evidence because there is no logical explanation for it? It certainly did not serve the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merlin is thought of by most humans as a simple embodiment of the wizard. &lt;i&gt;Merlins War&lt;/i&gt; reveals that he is much more; he is a powerful Creator God who is responsible for creating the human template and seeding life on the Earth. Moreover, Dracula is thought of as a fictional vampire, when he is, in fact, the being we call Satan, responsible for creating war and chaos on Earth and in other galaxies. There are two points of view to this story, and in order to be fair author Margaret Doner has agreed to tell both sides. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Merlins War &lt;/i&gt;posits that it is time for the playing field to be evened out. The Family of Dark has been in control for too long; its time for the Family of Light to move beyond the fear that has kept them enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
