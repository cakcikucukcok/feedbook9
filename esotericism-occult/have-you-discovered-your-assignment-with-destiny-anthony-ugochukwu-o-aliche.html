  <title>Have You Discovered Your Assignment with Destiny? - Anthony Ugochukwu O. Aliche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The subject of destiny has attracted various explanations from diverse schools of thought. While some believe in and espouse the philosophy of predestination, others hold that man is the architect of his own destinyand still others fail to believe in the concept at all. Even among those who believe in the concept of destiny, there is lack of consensus about its definition and its workings given the critical nature of the subject of destiny. There is a need for man to clearly understand and employ the knowledge in his journey from mortality to immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Have You Discovered Your Assignment with Destiny? author Anthony Ugochukwu O. Aliche thoroughly examines the concept of destiny and seeks to guide others to an understanding of how this important aspect of our existence functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey begins with Aliches lamentation of mans inability to acknowledge and define his destiny with particular reference to his assignment with himself, his obligation with his environment, and his assignment with the Creator and the entire cosmos. He believes that life lived without discovering ones assignment with destiny is life lived without putting God firstand consequently a life tragically wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opens our eyes to the fact that so many lives could make a quantum leap if only they could turn to God and nature for the discovery and manifestation of their destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world would be a better place if we all discovered that we have a role to play individually and collectively, and that we can only achieve if we strive to discover our assignment with destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
