  <title>The Joy of Fellowship - Edward J. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, man&#39;s nature complicates things, and we often cheat ourselves out of great joy by doing &quot;our own thing.&quot; How sad. There is no doubt God&#39;s plan for man includes man&#39;s happiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;God teaches us joyful living in at least two places. Biblically it is called &quot;walking in fellowship.&quot; This First Epistle of John focuses on &quot;fellowship.&quot; A verse-by-verse expository of that valuable material is extremely helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, the Old Testament prophet Enoch was given to us as a role model. God reduced his life of several years into three short phrases: &quot;He walked with God. He pleased God. He was translated to heaven.&quot; God showed his pleasure with his &quot;walk&quot; by taking him up to heaven without his seeing death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skimming along the surface, modern man has developed a superficial lifestyle. You will see the joy of living a life of &quot;fellowship with God&quot; on God&#39;s terms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
