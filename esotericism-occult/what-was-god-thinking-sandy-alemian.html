  <title>What Was God Thinking?! - Sandy Alemian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It began with one question...&lt;br /&gt;A response came...&lt;br /&gt;An intimate dialog followed.&lt;br /&gt;No concern was too silly.&lt;br /&gt;No challenge was too big.&lt;br /&gt;This engaging book captures it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was God thinking?! picks up a dialog that Sandy began in her first book, Congratulations... It&#39;s an Angel, where she shared the clarity and understanding she received after asking heartfelt questions of God, following the loss of her one month old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this beautiful, healing and thought-provoking conversation unfolds, Sandy shares, not only her challenges, but those of so many, around the themes of loss, relationships, finances, fear, truth and self-esteem. The more she questions, the more profoundly the answers come, and Sandy herself, is in awe as the journey back to love is revealed and simple truths about why we&#39;re here, the purpose of life, and the possibilities of peace on earth become the pages of this book. What was God thinking?! is a dialog of inspiration for anyone who&#39;s ever wondered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
