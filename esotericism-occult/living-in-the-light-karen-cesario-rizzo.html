  <title>Living in the Light - Karen Cesario Rizzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having experienced pain and trauma as a child, I brought that fear into my adult life. I know it was a choice; I didnt know any better.
In 2011, I began an amazing and miraculous journey of healing that was guided by angels. I began experiencing miracles. I was led to move from Chicago to Orlando where I was introduced to many teachers, both on this side and the other side.
In late 2014, I released my first book chronicling the healing that enabled me to move forward. My first book ends in my moving to Florida.
This is the continued story of my journey. The stories in this book are all true. They are a small compilation of Angel encounters and miracles Ive experienced since I began living my life in light and truth.
We all have dark periods in our lives. It is my belief that this is our own choice. Sometimes we need the darkness, that place we retreat to, so we may recognize the warmth of the light when it shines upon us.
It is in that light, Gods light, that I live now, no matter what challenges I face. If you are in a situation that does not serve your highest good, step out of that darkness and into the light. Love awaits you in the light." />
