  <title>Women of Spirit - Susie Mackie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women of Spirit - overwhelmingly inspiring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is an inspiration to all women in the twenty-first century, young and old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these incredible women sharing their stories, &lt;em&gt;Women of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; details the real-life adversity faced by ordinary women who have turned their lives around and now thrive. Readers will learn how women beat illness, disempowerment, racism, bereavement and lack of acceptance. Throughout the stories each woman has left clues, patterns and signposts about how they did this. These act as a guide for those who are still battling their own demons to pick out their own relevance - and so move towards true self-empowerment. It is a book of discovery and enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pioneering spirit of the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century suffragettes has been replaced today by new challenges for women - those more concerned with emotional crises and breakdown in communication in relationships. Life today is fought in the challenge to&lt;em&gt; be&lt;/em&gt;, and to be truly your &lt;em&gt;self &lt;/em&gt;without being belittled, bullied or abused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an age where youth and beauty are often held to be the same thing, it is refreshing and inspiring to find a source of true celebration of ordinary women who have lived, loved and struggled to be loved in return, fought their demons, and survived their challenges with heads held high. Now living fully empowered lives, they encourage and inspire the reader to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Susie&amp;rsquo;s own spirited nature is epitomised by this brave piece of work. It stands testament to her own unbreakable spirit.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;Jo Parfitt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
