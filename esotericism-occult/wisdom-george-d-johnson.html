  <title>Wisdom - George D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout history philosophers have sought to understand the nature of wisdom and how to achieve it, but Reverend George Johnsons Wisdom explains that true wisdom comes from above and is a necessity for daily living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For centuries, many people grew up in homes defi ned by tradition and wisdom while others grew up in homes defi ned by whim and lack of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wisdom informs us that a wise person seeks understanding and knowledge, and anyone can receive it if he or she seeks it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wisdom gives voice to the voiceless, help to the helpless, and hope to the hopeless.With this said, Johnsons own wisdom has directed him to construct Wisdom using an unconventional pattern, where readers do not necessarily have to read prior chapters in order to understand future chapters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wisdoms inspiring words captivate readers as each chapter tells a story, tells us what to do, and tells us what not to do. Wisdom touches on every aspect of life from individuals getting rid of baggage that so easily weighs us down to learning how to enjoy life by smelling the roses. To this end, Wisdom is an inspirational manuscript full of voices of wisdom and ethics for everyday living." />
