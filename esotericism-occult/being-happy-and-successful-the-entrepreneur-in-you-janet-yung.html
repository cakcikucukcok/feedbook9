  <title>Being Happy and Successful–The Entrepreneur in You - Janet Yung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unleash Your Intrinsic Talent  Maximize Your Potential and Build High Performance Teams! Over the last decade, as I studied and researched the 2000-year-old metaphysical system of Bazi, I discovered that written in our DNA code, are some of us who are more prone towards the entrepreneurial route than others. It is definitely not what some Bazi consultants or masters would call the wealth period. They claim that when we go through our wealth period, we will start a business, get rich or be wealthy if it is favourable for us. In this book, you will learn if you have the profile who has more of the entrepreneurial DNA code, the strengths of your profile in driving a business and the type of business model that your profile will be more comfortable with. I will also discuss how you can utilize this Asian Personality Profiling system to identify your intrinsic talent, how you can develop this intrinsic talent to become your competency and true talent. Finally, learn how you can assemble a winning team to complement your strengths for success in the longer term. Read this book to discover the Entrepreneur in You, unleash your intrinsic talent, maximize your potential and enjoy happiness and success in the process.
Janet has been my consultant for the last 9 years since 2006. She helped me create a $35m business by 2011. When she introduced the Bazi profiling system, we were able to identify key management to form a well-structured team. Janet could explain why some staff are especially suited to certain roles in the company. By allowing the various members of the team to focus on their strengths, it allowed the company to better use its resources.
