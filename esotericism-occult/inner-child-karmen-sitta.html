  <title>Inner Child - Karmen Sitta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the family of the mindthe conscious (mother and revealed), subconscious (child and magical), and superconscious (Universal Master Mind)and the relative symbols and signs in Hindu mythology. The author calls upon ancient Persian epic poetry, and a correlation between Persian, Armenian cultural Heroes and a Hindu Mythology. And there is even some touch of Native American belief. Readers will learn about the individual souls journey, how it relates to the eternal spirit, and how there is a drop of that eternal spirit within each of us. The reader will also learn about the importance of kundalini energy, a primordial energy recognized by yogis since ever, and its physical and emotional role in healing, as an extension to our mind family. And the yogic Treasure Island, the astral and light body map recalled with its original Sanskrit terminology for a full energetic benefit. But the starthe protagonistof this book, and of our personal journey, and evolution, is our inner tender child. As we have grown up, we have disconnected from this main source of joy and love, and have forgotten and wounded this important part of our being. Therefore, we are being hurt! Only when we acknowledge, remember, embrace, come home to, and heal our inner children from the inside out, our powerful cosmic children (Inner Cherub &amp; Cupids) will write a new destiny full of happiness so we may live with peace and joy and spread the light all around. We can be the cocreators of our happily ever after tale." />
