  <title>Are You Having Fun? - Carol Cheshire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The chains of habit are generally too small to be felt
until they are too strong to be broken.&lt;/i&gt;
Samuel Johnson&lt;/center&gt;
Learning how to recognize habits and addictions and how to deal with them effectively are challenges for any person living in the grip of addictionand for those who love them. Even with training, it can be difficult to recognize crucial signs that signal a problem. Some signs are so subtle that they are easy to miss, but with some guidance, this process can be less stressful for all involved. 
Many scientists feel that behavior modification is the best hope for those seeking to stop an addiction of any kind. The long, difficult journey of freedom from addiction begins only when the individual admits that there is a problem and is willing to change. For a parent, there is no loss deeper than that of a child claimed by addiction, and author Carol Cheshire knows that pain. 
Her experiences as a teacher, counselor, and grieving mother have all served to strengthen her resolve to educate others. She tells her story now in the hopes of helping other parents, partners, children, and friends to escape facing the loss of another person they love to addiction of any kind." />
