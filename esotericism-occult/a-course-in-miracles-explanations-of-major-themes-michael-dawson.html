  <title>A Course in Miracles - Explanations of Major Themes - Michael Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Course in Miracles can be difficult to understand on first reading as it is written on quite a high intellectual level. It can help to read some introductory material alongside a study of the Course. This series of articles and diagrams is presented with that in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This eBook begins with some brief, introductory material covering how A Course in Miracles came, what it is and a summary with charts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is followed by a collection of 33 articles and diagrams I have written over recent years; they explore many of the themes found in the Course, including the metaphysical and practical teachings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of this book you will find two &amp;#39;bonus chapters&amp;#39; (&amp;#39;Healing Ourselves&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;The Ladder of Forgiveness&amp;#39;) - excerpts from two of my other books (Healing the Cause and The Findhorn Book of Forgiveness).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Course in Miracles has been the inspiration for this book. What I have written is my own interpretation of some of the principles in the Course and, as such, it cannot match the depth and purity of the original teaching. If you find my writings of interest I would encourage you to study the Course&amp;#39;s teaching, for which there can be no substitute." />
