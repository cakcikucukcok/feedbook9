  <title>7 Steps to Emotional Freedom: Mind Body Soul and Spirit - Donna Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was when I realised that there was so much more to life than just going to work and paying the bills that life began to alter significantly for me. I realised I have a gift to help other women develop and move forward no matter what their circumstances were. When you acknowledge there are some life experiences that are holding you back and you are truly ready for change then the full impact of Emotional Freedom is absolutely enlightening. This is when your life will change from within. Unless you experience this then it&amp;rsquo;s hard to comprehend. People say that they feel lighter or now understand themselves from within. It is something that simply can only be experienced to understand the shift of clarity, life, love and happiness that will enter your life. Donna is an author, a facilitator, a coach and has an understanding of key techniques to unlock your blocks in life. Donna&amp;rsquo;s life experiences from being in a Domestic Violence relationship and having to re-build her life from nothing, gives her the vision to create better opportunities for women. Having a real understanding of confidence levels being depleted and how to re-establish confidence with her rapid success techniques. Donna works with women all over Australia and looking at adopting her practices overseas. Currently working with women who want to achieve more in life and release any blocks or limitations they are currently experiencing, Corporate entities with opportunities to help women in business achieve higher results and remove any pre-conditioned limitations, and schools to help those young&amp;nbsp; women develop strong values to enter adult life with confidence, after all they are who will become our future leaders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Donna&amp;rsquo;s passion also allows her to give back to the community where she donates to organisations in need of financial assistance. Whether that is for charities or not for profit businesses, Donna works with a number of organisations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
