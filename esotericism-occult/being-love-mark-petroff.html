  <title>Being Love - Mark Petroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whats the number one reason you dont feel loved or able to give love unconditionally? What if you were given simple tools to overcome this? At times, most of us have felt dissatisfied in relationships due to the core fear of not feeling good enough. In &lt;i&gt;Being Love&lt;/i&gt;, author and Life Coach Mark Petroff reveals keys to experiencing real and lasting lovelove that overcomes fear, ego patterns, and changing life circumstances. As a result of searching, praying, studying, and coaching all kinds of relationships over many years, he learned successful and universal principles to feel and radiate love.&lt;/p&gt;
During his coaching sessions and workshops, and through his own relationships, it became clear that we attract what we are. When we connect with the Divinity within us and shift perceptions and behaviors that seem to limit love, we realize that love isnt something we find; Love is what we become and share.&lt;/p&gt;
This book asks powerful questions, gives original ideas to empower your choices, and includes practical exercises that enable you to access inner wisdom and make positive changes. Such ideas, questions, and answers have the potential to free and enhance your relationship with yourself, others, and the higher Power you deem sacred." />
