  <title>God’S Visit - Sandy Olson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about everything that deep down inside, our inner self is aware of. All those maybe they are true subjects, or maybe we believe in them to comfort ourselves. Maybe they are just shadows in the dark that hopefully we can ignore. The thought that monsters exist under our beds just to frighten little children. The thoughts that there are extraterrestrials that could come at any moment, changing our very existence. Demons lurking around, causing unhappiness and misery. Spirits that have not moved on, making us feel uneasy, feeling we need to look back over our shoulders as they are watching. All kinds of religions are saying they are the truth and the only way for redemption. I have personally learned that God is beyond magnificent and at the same time he is someone who will never leave you behind or let you down." />
