  <title>Prophesy Unchained - Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prophesy Unchained&lt;/STRONG&gt;; is written based on events noted mainly in Revelation and Daniel, supported by all other writings of Bible Prophets. Some have said, You can&#39;t judge a book by its cover...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Thomas declares that, &quot;You cannot judge a book by a single chapter&quot;. Still - religious leaders build an entire doctrine upon a half sentence or a single word.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prophesy Unchained&lt;/STRONG&gt;; is written clearly - easily enough for a child to understand but too simple for an adult with a long standing history of being spoon fed convincing lies throughout a lifetime. Convinced by parents and ancestors who kept those lies alive. Many religious leaders and evangelists have become exceedingly rich by convincing people that the way to salvation is through better donations to their collection plate.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suddenly Resurrection - Chapter 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;; is based on Bible information like King David still in his grave and after the First Wave resurrection of Saints to accompany Christ for 1,000 years - everyone will be in their grave to be raised more than 1,000 years later. The dead know nothing - therefore; the next thing a dead person realizes is standing on earth with a few billion others waiting for some clothing.&lt;/P&gt;" />
