  <title>Connected Still … Love Continues Beyond the Grave - Margaret Cowie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard songs that triggered tears or generated goose bumps on your body from head to toe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has a uniquely familiar scent suddenly wafted by you in the most unusual place, conjuring up memories of a loved one who has passed on? Do electronic items in your home activate without power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have dreams featured a departed loved one brought back to life, in which you felt like you actually went somewhere with them only to wake up shocked that you are still in your bed and they are once again gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, good! Youve experienced contact of the extraordinary kind.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The physical bodies die, but the souls of loved ones live on in new forms. They proceed to communicate in order to assist in healing, embracing life, and making it wonderful again. If so desired, departed loved ones can be with those among the living in everything they do. As they reveal through signals that the afterlife exists, their hope is that the living will venture forward in life and eagerly seek all that is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
