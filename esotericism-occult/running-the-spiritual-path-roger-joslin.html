  <title>Running the Spiritual Path - Roger Joslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A compelling and inspiring guide to making running a spiritual sport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine achieving physical fitness and spiritual growth simultaneously. Roger Joslin&#39;s step by step program is an engaging exploration of his conviction that spiritual well being is as likely to happen while running along the trails of a favorite park as it is within the more traditional settings of neighborhood churches, synagogues, or mosques. Through awareness, chants and visualization, and through attention to the most evident aspects of the present moment--the weather, pain, or breathing--the simple run can become the basis for a profound spiritual practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Running the Spiritual Path&lt;/i&gt; Roger Joslin combines the insights gathered from thirty years of running, with a personal spiritual journey that is guiding him to the priesthood. While drawing from and exhibiting an abiding respect for the traditions and sacred practices of the world&#39;s great religions, the author describes a heretofore-unexplored method of sacred running, of bringing meditation and a prayerful communion to the running trail.&lt;/p&gt;" />
