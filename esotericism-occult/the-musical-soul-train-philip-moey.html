  <title>The Musical Soul Train - Philip Moey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As children, most of us freely express the joythe musicwithin us. Our emotions are close to the surface, and we can bring them forth at the drop of a hat. But as we become adults, the joy seems to get buried deeper and deeper. Real life can take the music from our very being. But does it have to be that way? Is there anything we can do about it?
In The Musical Soul Train: Discover the Songs from Your Heart, author Philip PM Moey shares his knowledge and experiences of lifes spiritual pathways. Moeys fifteen years of research has taught him that though there are many universal principles about life, many are fundamentally the same but approached from different angles. The paths eventually lead to a single life worth living if you choose to do it well. And to live well, you cannot allow the music to die within you.
Moey includes his personal musical flavor, but that does not mean it has to be ours; he reminds us that each of us has a song to be sung and showcased. The Musical Soul Train will thrill anyone who longs to tell his or her own story and anyone who is looking for a more meaningful, inspired life." />
