  <title>Prince of the Dark Shadows - Jinn Yah El</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book examines the life and experience of a young man who, during the grueling frontier campaign of embattled youth, challenged the status quo and dogmatic reality that would set the stage for war to regain his freedom.
The idea for this book came from a question about who we are, where we come from, and what has happened to us. This, unlike many others, is not just a tale of triumph or the overcoming of obstacles and setbacks. It is not just one mans throw of conspicuous bravery in the face of adversity. No. This book is about transcendence and enlightenment.
You will read about youthful exploits that pursued pain, hurt, and anger; the chase for intangible sough in objectiveness; and a journey that harnessed the inescapable will of bias, judgment, and indifference. This book details not only the life of such a young man and his struggle to endure abandonment, loss, and his fight for identity. More so, this book is about how that struggle equals strength and how consciousness is the result of losing oneself. It is about how the history that we all share is never lost but woven into the fabric of our everyday condition and that the power of the compound will of human experience lies dormant in every man, waiting to be unearthed and utilized to attain our highest heights.
This book demonstrates in a clear and compelling fashion the substantial role that dormancy and revelation plays in the development of the idyllic self.
In this book is empowerment. In it is inspiration and survival, but most importantly, in this book is all of us, for each of us shares in the tale of humanity and has won over dark shadows to prevail against." />
