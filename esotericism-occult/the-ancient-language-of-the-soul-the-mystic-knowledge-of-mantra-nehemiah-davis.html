  <title>The Ancient Language of the Soul: the Mystic Knowledge of Mantra - Nehemiah Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ancient Language of the Soul: The Mystic Knowledge of Mantra, Nehemiah Davis (Author). Discover an ancient science of manipulating subtle and gross pranas through sound vibrations. In this book, author Nehemiah Davis shares the knowledge on the relationship between mantra and the Soul. Mantra is actually the language of the Soul; its the sound vibrations used by the Soul to modify aspects of the Shakti powers into mind substance, astral, and physical matter. This book will help you to understand the essence of mantra, and gain a greater appreciation for it. Learn how to tap into the power of mantra and discover why the mantra power works. As you unveil the mystic knowledge of mantra, you can also explore how mantric sounds manipulate the cosmic energies or pranas of the Chakra System, the Nadi System, and Auric bodies. This is a 204-page intense book on the subject of Mantra Sastra (knowledge); it gives an in-depth look into the subtle operations of the manifested consciousness of man and its relationship with mantra. It also shows the effects mantra chanting has on your body, mind, and Soul. The book is complete with an introduction to the subject and a total of twelve chapters with a glossary, bibliography, and index. All this and so much more are unraveled here." />
