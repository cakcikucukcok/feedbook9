  <title>Your Inner God - Carmina Harr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I can certainly state that writing can change your life. It is one of the therapies I practised and it had very good results. That is how I began to write the book. Initially, out of impulse. Afterwards, I realized how much it helped me writing everything I felt in my heart. The miracle offered by writing is that you get the answers to all your questions. Those questions to which only your heart can answer. Once you find answers to everything you did not even think you would come up with solutions, you are absolutely healed. I feel that only a person completely healed can help the others. The rest is just dust in the wind. The message of the book is practically beyond words. If you open yourself, the God within you will write with your own hand everything your mind would not even think possible. 
A few words about me. Following my inner transformation, I have become what I am now. What are the fundamental features that define me? 
I am a determined woman, very active. I relish the experiences full of action. I always know what I want and where I want to get. I act for what I want. I am an expansive woman, full of life. I attract people around me by the intelligence and refinement I have. I am attracted to powerful persons with a sparkling intelligence. I have spiritual aspirations and I have the spontaneous quality of leading those around me on the path of self-discovery." />
