  <title>Restoring the Heart - Frank Scott, Nisa Montie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This kind of Love binds each of us eternally, carrying a message of hope to those that despair and find themselves isolated. It promotes the advancement of a Divine Civilization as each Realm acts as an expression of its own luminescent radiance and purity, expressing its own density related in quality and character to a material composition in a three-dimensional state, and becomes a way of the heart towards GodLiving Gods Dream: Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move through each world of God, as we vanish from one into the other, superposed, layered, and embedded dream-state into a singularity collapsed into a point of Lightthe state of pure awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have learned to give each other what we crave and desire, and in this way, we have built civilizations over time that we thought, and think, of as successes. Yet, the program we created removed us further from the Truth, caught us within our own web of third- and fourth-dimensional desires, leaving us with the realization that we are truly empty, dead to the Spirit, Soul, and the True Life-Giver, at the end of the road. All the things we do and have, for all their material or even emotional worth, cannot bring the joy and peace we really desire and need. Worst of all, we have taken from each other the means to know the Truth and make the right choices. We have robbed from one another the Voice from within, once we lost our mutual trust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
