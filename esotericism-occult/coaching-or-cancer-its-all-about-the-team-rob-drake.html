  <title>Coaching or Cancer: Its All About the Team - Rob Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is my story of twenty-eight years of coaching high school sports and dealing with success, frustration, failures, adversity, and building relationships along the way. It is also about losing some of those relationships, worrying about all of the what-ifs, and second guessing the things that were done. Before it was over, I was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and once again faced frustrations and adversity; even so, a strengthened faith and an overwhelming support system helped me deal with it. In the blink of an eye, those twenty-eight years were put into perspective, and things that I had once thought were important were not. It was the life lessons that I tried to impart to those that I taught and coached that best serve me now and hopefully can give you perspective as well." />
