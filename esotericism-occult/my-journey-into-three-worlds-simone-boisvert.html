  <title>My Journey into Three Worlds - Simone Boisvert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the years many people have mentioned to me that I should write a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently the time has come to tell my stories of what my God-given talents have helped me accomplish throughout my life. This book shares some of my legacy with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this autobiography I recount many of my personal stories and of some unusual experiences, namely: My Journey into Three Worlds: Physical, Psychic and Spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has played a vital role throughout my life. Ive sung with 18-piece bands including Lionel Hampton and his band, jazz trios and quartets, solo with my guitar, performing in two separate duos plus I have written three musical stage plays and 75 songs. During this time, I was also working at the University of Vermont and raising my daughter by myself following a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a psychic all of my adult life having read thousands of people from all walks of life as I was able to lift the veil of their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also blessed with a healing gift which helped hundreds of people alleviate assorted health problems. Some are chronicled within this book. Adding to my spiritual responsibilities, sometimes I had the most awesome visions for the world and what Gods judgment may bring to humankind. See within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will enjoy reading this book as much as I have enjoyed writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
