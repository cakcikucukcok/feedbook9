She shares the knowledge and wisdom she gained after she opened up to living a spiritually guided life. &lt;b&gt;I AM a Soul Champion&lt;/b&gt; is a practical guide for using intuition, healing and manifesting along with archangel aromatherapy. The author has distilled the information into a combination of healing guides, teachings and easy-to-use daily practices and rituals. A soul champion is someone who understands that he or she is more than just mind and body. Rachael believes that everyone has the ability to access healing and guidance from angels and spiritual guides in order to heal, co-create, and manifest in every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;
