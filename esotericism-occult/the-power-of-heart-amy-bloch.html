  <title>The Power of Heart - Amy Bloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The secret to a good life is not what you think.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most of us have been raised to believe that we can solve any problem if we think about it hard enough. We spend years honing our intellect, knowing that our brains are our best line of defense against whatever roadblocks life throws us. But each and every one of us has a secret weapon to call upon when brainpower isn&#39;t enough, and that is Heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy Bloch discovered the power of heart quite by accident. An accomplished psychiatrist, fully in control of her professional and family life, Amy was dealt what she thought was a devastating, insurmountable set-back when her daughter Emily was born with a severe brain malformation. Amy tried desperately to &quot;fix&quot; Emily, and exhausted herself in her efforts to deal with the &quot;problem&quot; using her intellect, going at it brain-first--the default way we tend to approach challenges in our society. Emily, on the other hand, lives completely heart-first: she simply doesn&#39;t have the capabilities to approach life brain-first. Yet to Amy&#39;s initial surprise--and ultimately, to her great admiration--Emily is remarkably happy and successful.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Power of Heart&lt;/i&gt; is the distillation of what Emily taught Amy--lessons that are applicable to anyone&#39;s life. Learning to be Emily&#39;s mom and observing how Emily approaches life prompted a radical change in Amy&#39;s life.  It also transformed her work with patients in her professional practice, where she witnessed over and over again how getting out of brain and into heart made life deeper and richer, less stressful, and more meaningful. While the brain is amazing, powerful, and useful, it does come with limitations. There&#39;s some stuff the brain just doesn&#39;t know, which is where heart comes in. Tapping into heart helps your brain perform better, and makes you stronger and smarter than you will ever be trusting only your brain. Heart will allow you to live with uncertainty; find strength, resilience, courage, and persistence in tough times; cast off self-criticism and doubt, and have a lot more confidence and fun. &lt;i&gt;The Power of Heart&lt;/i&gt; is for readers of all ages and walks of life who are ready to move beyond the brain-first strategy, and embrace heart as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
