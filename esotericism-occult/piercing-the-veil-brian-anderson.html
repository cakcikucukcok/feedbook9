  <title>Piercing the Veil - Brian Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written for you and for all! When you feel a sudden chill go up your spine or feel tingles on your head, that is your intuitive guidance kicking in and reminding you to listen and pay attention. There are meanings in the poems for each and every one of you. They did not come from the mind of Brian, but they came intuitively from across the veil to help us and to give us hope and meaning to life. The book is twofold: (1) it serves as a reminder that you are not alone, and the spirit is real; and (2) it serves as a reminder that you are a perpetual immortal soula soul that will leave the physical body behind one day and cross over into a sea of love so intense it can only be referred to as concentrated love." />
