  <title>Secrets of a World Untold - Troy Dennie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peace, honesty, intuition, and love are the recurring themes in &lt;i&gt;Secrets of a World Untold,&lt;/i&gt; an inspiring and spiritual poetry collection. In addition to these emotional subjects, poet Troy Dennie shares his thoughts on world order, political agendas, messages from God, spiritual and solar symbols, and how it all relates to society. His poetry examines life with purpose and searches for meaning. 
His underlying message is that Gods love conquers allcreating beautiful rivers and lakes, mountains, the sun, the moon, and the stars. Through respectful observation of Islam, Christianity, Raja Yoga, and Taoism, Dennies spiritual path has led him to a place of peace and love.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not Afraid to be Real&lt;/b&gt;
Not afraid 2 be real
I can&#39;t control how others feel nor do I strive for a mass appeal
I&#39;m tired of people accepting oppression and capitalism, monotony and consumerism
Some make reference to the heat in the kitchen yet 80% of folk in mental prison
If each person helped a stranger there would be less danger
World wars one and two were systematically orchestrated, Illuminati infiltrated
Hepatitis, aids, malaria, genocides delegated
Health and information manipulated
Truth and history or herstory fragmented
Religious origins sacred and recently obliterated &lt;/i&gt;" />
