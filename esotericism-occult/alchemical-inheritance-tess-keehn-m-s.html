  <title>Alchemical Inheritance - Tess Keehn M.S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born into the aftermath of a family tragedy, author Tess Keehn responded as a young adult by dedicating herself to finding emotional balance and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alchemical Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; presents the honest story of Keehns family history and of her own life experiences, describing how her journey through darkness eventually empowered her to manifest a life of peace, joy, and fulfillment. She tells the tale of her grandmothers mysterious murder, her mothers descent into mental illness, the dissolution of her familys substantial wealth, and the near collapse of her own life under the weight of her familys secrets and financial ruin.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keehns own inheritance moved through the extremes of substance abuse and despair until a spiritual awakening in her twenties called her to tap the power of a myriad of resources and forge her own path to healing and redemption. Through her story, she hopes others may find a revised road map for their lives that moves them forward with clarity, excitement, and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In this masterfully written memoir  Keehn combines spirituality, mental-health practices, and an ever-growing love of herself that leads her readers on a path to a deep and sustaining healing.
Kathari Findlen, author, Meeting in the Space Between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alchemical Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; is a rare book written with both the openness of a client and the discerning eye of a skilled professional psychotherapist. 
Lama Yeshe Jinpa, from the Foreword&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this personal narrative, one woman shares her journey of overcoming obstacles of victimization, substance abuse, and abandonment to emerge healed, whole, and peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
