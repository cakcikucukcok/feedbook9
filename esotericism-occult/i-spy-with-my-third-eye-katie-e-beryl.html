  <title>I Spy with My Third Eye - Katie E. Beryl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Ever since she was a small child, Katie E. Beryl wanted to see spirits. She even prayed to God to gift her with such aptitude. It wouldnt have been too shocking, since psychic blood ran through her veins. Katies own grandmother could see the future, but she gave up her talents after a painfully accurate reading that foretold a funeral.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Katies life changed at the age of forty-seven at Port Arthur in Tasmania, Australia, where her dormant abilities sprung to life. She became more in tune with herself and considers this moment her epiphany. In a photo, using her own camera, Katie captured the truth of the afterlife, and she shares this image for all to see, filled with spirits and apparitions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She now connects with her loved ones anytime she wants. You can too if you tap into your spiritual side, let go of built-up ego, and use your inner self to be your guide. Part memoir, part self-help book, part educational text, &lt;i&gt;I Spy with My Third Eye&lt;/i&gt; is an interesting experience for those who seek to seize their own psychic potential.&lt;/P&gt;" />
