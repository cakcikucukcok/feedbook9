  <title>Embracing Grace - L.D. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of grace did not begin with the New Covenant. It started with Gods first revelation of himself. Grace and mercy areand have always beenpart of Gods character. Mankind has not always enjoyed the fuller revelation of grace as given to this generation.
Author L. D. Clarks Embracing Grace: Where the Law Ends, Grace Begins explains the evolution of grace. It is revealed in Genesis, but generations who lived before Christ could not enjoy its fullness because wrath was upon every soul that sinned. While the law of Moses temporarily stayed the execution of justice, it did not offer soul salvation. After Jesus bore Gods wrath for us all, greater grace became Gods gift to us all.
It behooves us to know, understand, and avail ourselves to this new relationship with the Father through Jesus Christ. Grace is part of the Fathers legacy to this generation. Embracing Grace: Where the Law Ends, Grace Begins shows you how to revel in Gods grace and deepen your faith." />
