  <title>Panic Attacks - Paul Ianni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Panic Attacks: Why They Were Worth Experiencing&lt;/i&gt;, author Paul Ianni talks about his life and what has led to his panic attacks, which began at age fifty. He hopes that by sharing his experiences, others might be able to better understand their own issues. He believes that many people dont acknowledge the fact that they have panic attacks; they just put on a brave face and ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of his panic attacks, he was desperate for a miracle curebut he soon discovered that there was no such thing. A year after the first panic attack, his life was back to normaland it was then that he realised his normal life had always been full of anxiety and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using techniques that had previously helped him overcome academic difficulties, Paul was able to transform his life from panic and anxiety to peace and love. He conquered a lifetime of self-doubt and self-defeating negativity, learning to use his brain in a positive way to defeat his panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques are simple to use and achievable by anyone. Combining them with what he has learned about new age thinking, &lt;i&gt;Panic Attacks &lt;/i&gt;share what enabled Paul to turn his life aroundand offers hope to those suffering under the same troubles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
