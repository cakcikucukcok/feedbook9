  <title>The Book of Women - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Book of Women: A Celebration of Women and the Female Spirit&lt;/i&gt;, one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers discusses the importance and value of feminine strengths. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The woman should search into her own soul for her own potential and develop it, and she will have a beautiful future.&quot;--Osho&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osho explores the role of women in our society. Up until now, he says, both religious institutions and politics have remained male-dominated--not only male-dominated but male-chauvinistic. This has created so many of the crises that we see in the world now, brought about by excesses of ambition, competitiveness, and greed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these pages, Osho challenges readers to reclaim and assert the feminine qualities of love, joy, and celebration to bring a reunion of the intellect and the heart that is so desperately needed. He looks to the female spirit in all of us as a way to nurture the soul and cultivate a healthy relationship with spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day&lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
