  <title>The Family of Light - Rebecca Berryman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Projecting beyond the sun and back again-that is the path and thoughtful journey of &lt;I&gt;The Family of Light.&lt;/I&gt; While stirring a full range of emotions and providing concepts that stimulate the inner vision, this accumulation of facts, knowings, and sharings assists us in preparation for what is around the corner as we continue to cavort with planet Earth. Not by words alone, but through the veiled latticework of deep and abiding love threaded from chapter to chapter, are we reconnected one to another. We are encouraged to remember those days when we played in the Light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The pages turn, our hearts open and expand, as we align with our soul(s). A chapter on Twin Flames is one such opportunity. Having a look at our darker side is another. Angels, extraterrestrials, it&#39;s all here, transporting us along the road of boundless living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;The Family of Light&lt;/I&gt; is the final offering in a trilogy, which includes &lt;I&gt;It All Serves&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;In Service of Self.&lt;/I&gt; They may be read in order or enjoyed for the vibrancy and veracity of each individual title. A notably different look at humanity as a whole, this material sets the groundwork for experiencing life to a higher power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
