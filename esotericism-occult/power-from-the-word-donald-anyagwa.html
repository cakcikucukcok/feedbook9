  <title>Power from the Word - Donald Anyagwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have, through this compiled work, Power from the Word: Sunday Homilies for Cycle B, tried to make alive and active Gods Word to us through the liturgical readings for Sundays and Feast Days of the occurring year. The arrangement and methodology flow from those of Cycle AAdvent-Christmas-Lent-Easter-Ordinary Time-Feast Days. Through the homilies, I gave more consideration to what goes around our todays human situations than how it happened when Jesus was walking alongside the streets of Judea and Galilee and working amongst people with different cultural settings. Nevertheless, his teachings and approaches are the indispensable yardstick. And this is what any homilist has to bear in mind, even when this book is considered worthwhile making reference to in preparing homilies for the People of God. Nonetheless, reading through the homilies of this presentation for personal reflection and growth in spiritualityoutside the Sunday liturgyis entirely a different thing. It could be a stitch on time!" />
