  <title>Intrinsic Hope - Kate Davies, Vicki Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Climate disruption. Growing social inequality. Pollution. We are living in an era of unprecedented crisis, resulting in widespread feelings of fear, despair, and grief. Now, more than ever, maintaining hope for the future is a monumental task &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intrinsic Hope&lt;/i&gt; offers a powerful antidote to these feelings. It shows how conventional ideas of hope are rooted in the belief that life will conform to our wishes and how this leads to disappointment, despair, and a dismal view of the future. As an alternative, it offers &#39;intrinsic hope,&#39; a powerful, liberating, and positive approach to life based on having a deep trust in whatever happens. The author, a hopeful survivor, shows how to cultivate intrinsic hope through practical tips and six mindful habits for living a positive, courageous life in these troubled times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether working directly on ecological or social issues or worried about children and grandchildren, this book is for everyone concerned about the future and looking for a deeper source of hope for a better world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kate Davies &lt;/b&gt;MA, DPhil, has worked on environmental and social issues for her entire career. She is emeritus faculty at Antioch University, senior fellow at the Whidbey Institute and clinical associate professor in the University of Washington&#39;s School of Public Health. Her written work has been published in newspapers, magazines and journals and she is the author of &lt;i&gt;The Rise of the U.S. Environmental Health Movement.&lt;/i&gt; Davies lives in Langley, WA.&lt;/p&gt;" />
