  <title>Believe in Faith - Marcus Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The fundamental objective of this book is to define the meaning of faith in the 
Lord God Jesus Christ, in yourself, and in the wonderful things in store for the future. I 
have always believed that God is in total control of each of our lives, and that He has a 
plan for profound greatness on our behalf. You have the opportunity to achieve the 
greatness for which God has in store for your life, and it is your responsibility to do 
exactly that. God has loved us all unconditionally prior to the day for which we were 
brought into the world. No matter where you are in your life or what you may have done, 
He will always lead you in the right direction if you ask Him to. You were put on Earth 
to bring about a positive impact into the lives of others. This is your purpose for being 
here. To fulfill your purpose, you were given many gifts from God to do so. It is up to you 
to reach out to God in prayer; and as time goes on, you will not only achieve what God 
has in store, but you will ultimately become the person that He created you to be!" />
