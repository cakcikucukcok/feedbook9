  <title>The Galilean Pendulum - Bill Kaspari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of how an unseen world began to reveal itself to me in the years following the death of my son.  It tells of the transformation I went through; how I was taken from viewing life through a lens which allowed me to see only the physical world to a vantage point where I was given a much broader view of our existence.
I invite the reader to take the journey I found myself on; what for me was a paradigm shift in my understanding of life.  This journey began at a point where my feelings were a mixture of hopelessness, deep sorrow and frustration.  I began a search trying to find answers to the question of what lies behind our existence, and in particular to try to determine whether or not I would ever be with my son again.
I am not a religious person, so I began to search for answers in a way that satisfied my scientific mentality and was surprised that, after a great deal of searching, both in the literature and in my own soul, the answers gradually began to appear.  I discovered what for me is a new reality - a much better, far more interesting and more cheerful one than I ever had before.
