  <title>How Satan Deceives You - Kris Doulos</title>

The first task in engaging an enemy is to learn about him and his tactics. Unfortunately this hasnt been done well enough for people to recognize the voice inside their brain trying to get them to make bad decisions. Not recognizing thoughts put into your brain by Satan causes you to think they are your thoughts telling you how bad you are or giving you harmful solutions to your problems. Satans goal is to get humans to destroy themselves with vices or conflicts. While reading this book you may find ideas different from what you normally hear from religious leaders. The information in this book is the result of many years of experience working with God, winning and losing battles with Satan, countless hours of study of the Bible and the determination to place truth above opinion, tradition or status.&lt;/P&gt;

This is the problem Jesus faced when he tried to correct the theology of the Jewish leaders. What Jesus told the Jewish leaders was not new, it had always been in their Scriptures. The contents of this book are not new they have always been in the Bible. Opinion, tradition and political correctness have neutered the church and made it impotent. This book is an attempt to reveal Satan, his tactics and the people who work for him. This information may keep you from being his next meal because, as Peter said, he is walking about looking for someone to devour.&lt;/P&gt;" />
