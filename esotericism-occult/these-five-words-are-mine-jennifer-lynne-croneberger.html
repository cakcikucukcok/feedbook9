  <title>These Five Words Are Mine - Jennifer Lynne Croneberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;These Five Words are Mine&quot; is a journey to awareness through the stories of every day life.
It embraces the everyday conversations we have with ourselves. It captures the connections we see and those we live with others.
It&#39;s an ordinary perspective with perhaps different eyes. 
It&#39;s a walk down that familiar road with all the lights on instead of the one we so often take surrounded by darkness.
It&#39;s a jolt of fresh air when you can&#39;t breathe.
It&#39;s days with a notebook, but not writing so you miss out on what you can&#39;t see when your head is down. 
The words are already so much a part of us, they don&#39;t even need to be written.
Just felt.
Have you ever felt a really deep connection to someone else?  To a feeling? To words?
Author Jen Croneberger brings awareness into our every day life by connecting us to all of it.
Through every day stories, she takes us on a journey. One you will likely relate to as well.
It&#39;s time to take that walk with eyes wide open.
Let&#39;s begin&quot;
Review:
&quot;Far from an ordinary book. It is a friend. If read with an open heart, not only do we realize we are not alone, but we will never look at ourselves and those around us the same.&quot;--Daniel Matos, Spoken Word Artist." />
