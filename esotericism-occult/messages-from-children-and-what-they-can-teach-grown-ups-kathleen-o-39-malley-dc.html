  <title>Messages from Children … and What They Can Teach Grown-Ups - Kathleen O&#39;Malley Dc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; and a little child shall lead them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early one Sunday morning, my daughter was cutting and pasting from a magazine as part of her second-grade homework assignment. She was singing, making up the words as she went along. She really caught my attention as she sang the words, Im doing what I was born to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful song, I said. So what were you born to do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She paused for just a brief moment, then looked at me with a grin and said, To be a kid. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
How do we stop fighting for our survival and get back to thriving? How do we return to that sense of knowing that all of our needs will be met? How do we restore that inborn trust, natural wonder, sense of joy and peace? How do we step unto our true path and come to know that for which we were made? According to Dr. Kathleen OMalley, the answers lie in Messages from Children  and What They Can Teach Grown-ups. It is a collection of eighty-eight timely and powerful messages for self-healing, personal growth and leading a more meaningful existence. It shows us how to power up our intuitive sense, pay attention to what really matters, and cultivate our creative energies. It serves as a reminder that every person is an expression of divine love and a gift to this world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
