  <title>The Ghost of Anna - S.J. Groves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is in essense a ghost story, the old fashioned kind! but it does deal with other complex family issues!
Sarah Jones was a 6 year old little girl living with her family in an old house, that was the family&#39;s home in the town of Bristol, the southwest of England, set in 1974 to end of 1984. You will follow Sarah&#39;s chilly haunting memories of a ghost of a little girl Anna and her father, through Sarah&#39;s eyes as her experiences from the age of 6 become more apparent with sinister intentions. Sarah and her family will learn of the dark secrets this house holds, unknowing that a evil presence wants this secret to stay hidden and will do whatever it takes to keep it that way! This is based on true events that happened to a family in an actual house! 
This is one of the first of three books, a trilogy. Second is a prequel to the first set in 1860 - 1880 and the third a sequel to the first set in 1985 - 2012" />
