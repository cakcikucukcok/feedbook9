  <title>Practical Feng Shui for the Office - Kathryn Wilking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have met with so many people in the last few years who apologize for their office. Apologize? For what? Well, a lot of them are embarrassed. They dont really like their workspace. The problem is in the flow, the routine and the organization of their work. Feng shui can help you with all of these things. A feng shui office will give you a balanced flow of energy so you can accomplish the tasks of the day. The goal is to make your time more productive and more functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to take the mystery out of feng shui and show you how practical it really is. Feng shui can give you guidance to become more aware of your surroundings and to find the proper balance in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Five-Element Theory, Wilking presents a practical view of feng shui concepts and takes you through the steps in setting up your physical workspacefrom choosing office furniture and dcor to desk placement and seating arrangements. She then shows you how, by taking a simple Personal Element Profile quiz, you can determine your dominant element, and the elements of those around you. This will help you understand yourself and others, in order to assemble your best team to create a successful, organized and productive work environment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
