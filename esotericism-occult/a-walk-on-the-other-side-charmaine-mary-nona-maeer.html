  <title>A Walk on the Other Side - Charmaine Mary Nona Maeer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charmaine Addresses something that comes to us all, and to all our loved ones, and which we are very ill equipped to handle; death, the end of life, or the passing from one state, which we know, to another, which we cannot know.
A near death experience, and the existence and reality of these experiences is well attested and undoubted, is a great and impressive glimpse behind the veil, and into another, truer reality than that of every day. Charmaine has the ability to communicate, and her writing is clear and lucid. She deals sensitively and perceptively with what can be  a difficult subject. Behind her veil, is a brighter, vibrant, living truth. From her journey she has brought back much of value, a golden treasure, and she shares this .
Many of us would dearly wish to pierce, however little, the veil that hides us from other worlds, and to see what else is there. This book is one that helps us understand a little more the strange ways of creation." />
