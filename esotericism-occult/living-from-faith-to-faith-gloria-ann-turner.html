  <title>Living from Faith to Faith - Gloria Ann Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are struggling in areas of your life, and it seems like the devil is working overtime to destroy you, let me give you a piece of truth to consider today: Your victory is in the Word of God!
In Isaiah 54:17, we see that no weapon formed against you shall prosper. It is vital that you live in that knowledge. God created you to live victoriously. His Word is your armor! Jesus said, I give you the keys of the kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (Matthew 16:19). Our fight is the good fight of faith in Christ Jesus!
I pray that these sermons will enlighten, encourage, and strengthen your faith to trust and pursue God in everything you do. Romans 1:17 reads, For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith." />
