  <title>Gratitude: The Life-Changing Magic of Thank-Yous - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Are you always searching for ways to improve your positive emotional state? Do you wish to increase your sense of wellbeing? Are you ready to &lt;u&gt;discover how to trigger those &amp;lsquo;feel good&amp;rsquo; hormones on a daily basis with little effort&lt;/u&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since childhood, we are all taught two things: to say &amp;lsquo;please&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo;. It is our parent&amp;rsquo;s way of teaching us children how to be polite and be kind to others. Yet, the only thing we are taught about &amp;lsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo; is you should only say it when you receive something and only because it&amp;rsquo;s the polite thing to do. However, there is much more in that little phrase than you can even imagine. There is a magical power that lies within those two words that give you and the person you are speaking to great chain reactions of happiness and peace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Increasing your use of the words &amp;lsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo; is an instant triggering effect that helps you and the people you are talking to. You can use it to turn an argument around or cheer a person up. And the effects for you alone are endless. It&amp;rsquo;s all about having an attitude of gratitude to start changing your life, and the lives of those you dearly love and care about. And that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Gratitude: The Life-Changing Magic of Thank-Yous&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
