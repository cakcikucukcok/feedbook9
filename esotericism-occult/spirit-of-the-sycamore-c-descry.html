&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;CELESTIAL GUIDANCE--&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;THEY FOUND DESERT JUSTICE!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Ter Martel&lt;/B&gt; is a troubleshooter for ruthless developers. He is a two-dimensional shark who knows all the dirty tricks it takes to win, and  believes  it is right to use them...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Misty&lt;/B&gt; is fleeing seven years of hell married to a totally amoral man. Now she is adrift, running from the courts, looking for spiritual guidance, unaware that powerful forces are shaping the essence of her life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Arnie Cain&lt;/B&gt;, County Marshal, spent a horrible night sitting vigil with the body of the dead girl as she floated in the water hole, the latest in a bizarre series of murders. He knows that all of the dead have been cruelly murdered. What is eating at him is the reality that he cant prove it and arrest the killers. He is convinced that the guilty will get away with murder. He doesnt know about Desert Justice!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Doc Connely&lt;/B&gt; has amassed a fortune that he plans to pull into the grave with him...If he ever dies. He has discovered a force that will change the world and he lives on to protect its source...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Orante&lt;/B&gt; had escaped from a bamboo cage in Hanoi with dreams of power and position. Now he controls the fate and fortunes of thousands. Having attained his dream, he finds himself imprisoned again. Now he is trapped by his followers, forever bound, forever chaste.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Celesta&lt;/B&gt; believes that the Pleiadeans from the constellation Taurus have defeated their enemies from the Dog Star Canis and are coming back to Earth to rescue the souls they hid here 50,000 years ago...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Raven&lt;/B&gt;, once an archaeologist at the top of her profession, has discovered the desiccated bodies of the dead, deep within a cave in Prophet Canyon. Driven mad, she taps into a source of ancient wisdom and power.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;Well written.    Well researched.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;A great read!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;Be prepared!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;CENTER&#39;&gt;It will change your way of believing.&lt;/P&gt;
