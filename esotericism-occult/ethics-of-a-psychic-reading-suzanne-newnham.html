  <title>Ethics of a Psychic Reading - Suzanne Newnham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Understand the responsibilities of working with energies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on her personal experiences and observations of energy and psychic phenomena and the manner in which they are delivered, psychic Suzanne Newnham offers this guide designed to help people expand their understanding of the world related to psychic and energetic phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organised into three easy-to-follow sections, Ethics of a Psychic Reading will help both amateur and professional messengers build their knowledge base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section clarifies terminology used when speaking about the psychic world, including terms used to describe the various types and styles of psychic connection, tools used for psychic readings and healing, and techniques utilising psychic communication. The second section looks at style and the delivery of readings. The third section addresses other aspects that are important when looking at the complexities and the ethics of a psychic reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide, presented from a psychics perspective, seeks to make the most of giving paranormal messages and understanding possible ways a client might receive those messages. A summary is included at the end of most chapters to offer concise points for study and to facilitate discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethics of a Psychic Reading is also designed to elicit questions that will encourage readers to develop their own awareness based on responses and to be mindful of some of the truths and inaccuracies that surround an esoteric subject.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Short stories and three co-authored novellas have been published and I am currently writing two books - one is historical non-fiction based on an extraordinary woman; the other is a transformational style story ...<br /><b><i>Suzanne Newnham Ethics of a Psychic Reading</i></b> | One area that Suzanne expands is to understand that a psychic and medium reader has a very strong responsibility when working with someone elseâ€™s energy.
