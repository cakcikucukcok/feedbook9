  <title>Spirit Guides from the Future - David Wegert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is a telepathic communication between myself and Dar, a evolved human from 23 million years in the future, as well as several other guides, spiritual and otherwise, from various future time periods.
            Although most of the contact is through Dar, several of his companions, from various timelines from a few centuries to over 1000 million years in the future have made some observations about various time periods.
            The book covers technology, spirit guides, singularities, timelines, evolution, time travel, parallel worlds, future cities and other realities. It also covers altered states of consciousness, the 2012 event, space travel, time lines, advanced data storage, power generation, future history and my notes.
              There is discussion in time and the nature of reality, as well as technological development and where it is leading us into the future. It is about possibilities, and I do not mean it to be either a positive or negative statement, but an observation of what is. I hope the book will encourage some people to objectively seek out alternative possibilities." />
