  <title>Butterfly Prayers - Chauntella A. Ware</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The title of this book is Butterfly Prayers. It is a book that I decided to write based on prayers that I have prayed and experiences that I had to encounter to get through life. The butterfly symbolizes the scars on my face in the shape of a butterfly and the prayers are what I pray daily to keep my eyes focused on GOD despite the pain I encounter on a daily basis. Through these prayers GOD speaks to me and he will speak to you as well. Also my children, my family, and friends are the ones that constantly remind that life is worth living and it will come with trials and tribulations but GODS Grace and mercy is what sees me though my daily journey. I know that at first the prayers seem small but one day they will blossom and fly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
