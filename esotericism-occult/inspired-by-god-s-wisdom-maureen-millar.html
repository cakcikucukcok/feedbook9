  <title>Inspired by God’S Wisdom - Maureen Millar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by Gods Wisdom is not a book with a beginning, unfolding, and end. It is a book you can open at any page, and there you will find, spelled out, the wisdom and love we may recognize as coming from the spiritual one I call God. Often I have recommended to those who buy or consider this book that they open the pages randomly with a short prayer, believing that there is a message for them there for that day. And many tell me it works for them. Indeed, God has recommended I follow my own recommendation, and sure enough, as I do, God speaks to me too! There is something in the book for everyone and certainly something there for you." />
