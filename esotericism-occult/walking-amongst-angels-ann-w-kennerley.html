  <title>Walking Amongst Angels - Ann W. Kennerley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walking Amongst Angels contains the most important and informative wisdom available today on the realm of Angels. How humanity can connect to the angelic realms as we move forward in 2012 and beyond; where lies the fifth-dimension.&lt;br /&gt;
In meditations and exercises throughout the book you can connect to the Angels in ways you never imagined. With links to your Spirit Guides allowing you access to the higher energies, spiritual knowledge and wisdom as the Angels open new doorways.&lt;br /&gt;
The book is a unique piece of work in which you will be able to share the experience knowledge and energy of someone who has walked this pathway for many years. Appealing to all; those who are already well-read on the subject and those who wish to take their first steps to opening the door to All that is, the book brings the comprehensive knowledge that people have been waiting for. &lt;br /&gt;
Bringing two worlds together Ann is a unique lady who stands at the gate of our earthly reality, drawing back the veil to reveal the realms beyond our own. &lt;br /&gt;
The message from the Angels is a simple one. They are the source of all love and well-being. When you open yourself to this love you open yourself to an abundance of earthly and spiritual awareness and learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
