  <title>Bodied Mindfulness - Winnie Tomm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; “I see spirituality and social change to be integrally related to each other. I believe that liberation efforts that are supported by spiritual experiences of integration promote human dignity as well as social equality.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bodied Mindfulness&lt;/i&gt; combines spiritual, social and analytical perspectives to explore topics central to women’s development: spirituality, women’s bodies, cultural constructions of women’s sexuality in language, sexual ethics, the sexual contract in politics and at work, and the relation between nature and culture. It is Tomm’s deeply held conviction that women need to bring a vital spirituality to feminist social criticism in order to resolve these issues and increase their power to promote social justice and ecological balance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tomm embraces a vast store of knowledge from diverse sources, including Buddhist, shamanist and feminist resources. In a move away from abstract theorizing, she explicitly connects theory with realities lived by women. Grounding theory in personal experience — her own and others — Tomm delivers a powerful and empowering account of women’s spirituality. The resulting ontological transformation allows women to live deeply in the body while strengthening their relation to human and non-human matter and energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bodied Mindfulness&lt;/i&gt; will be of great interest to feminist scholars in all disciplines, but most particularly to those in Women’s Studies and Religious Studies. &lt;/p&gt;" />
