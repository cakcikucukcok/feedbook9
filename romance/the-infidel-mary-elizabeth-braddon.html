After meeting with &amp;quot;Oxford Methodists&amp;quot;, however, Antonia begins, little by little, asking questions about the meaning of human existence: life, death, faith, religion, etc. Among the &amp;quot;Methodists&amp;quot; we find several prominent personalities, including Stobard, with whom the protagonist weaves a deep friendship. On the other hand, however, Antonia also meets Lord Kilrush who is struck by the beauty and intelligence of the girl. Kilrish begins to woo Antonia and take the two, intertwine a relationship, until they get married. Meanwhile, secretly, even Stobard is in love with Antonia and from now on the story becomes more and more intricate, complex and compelling ... &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The vast literary production of Mary Elizabeth Braddon includes eighty novels, numerous comedies, poems, essays and short stories.The author received numerous criticisms for having given excessive centrality to compromising issues such as polygamy and crime.&amp;nbsp;" />
