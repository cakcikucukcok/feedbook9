  <title>Staking His Claim (A Line of Duty Novel) - Tessa Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;NYPD sniper Matt Donovan is in Hell. Instead of driving his best friend&#39;s little sister home from college, he&#39;s stuck with her roommate--a fresh-faced ray-of-sunshine with a body that makes grown men weep. There&#39;s no way he&#39;ll allow himself to taint the little vixen, no matter how hard she tries to tempt him, so he resigns himself to the longest--and hardest--drive of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt&#39;s obvious attraction suits grad student Lucy Mason just fine. She had no idea her brother&#39;s best friend was so deliciously hot. Knowing he&#39;d never have his wicked way with his buddy&#39;s sister, she lies about her identity and seduces him. But Matt&#39;s no fumbling college boy. His desires run deep--and dark--and he wants to teach Lucy what wicked &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt&#39;s demanding appetites only make Lucy want &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;. But when her cover&#39;s blown, he&#39;s furious--even as his hunger for her becomes insatiable. Matt can&#39;t trust anyone, least of all himself. And he knows all too well that darkness always destroys the light...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Line of Duty series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s His&lt;br&gt;* Officer Off Limits&lt;br&gt;* Asking for Trouble&lt;br&gt;* Staking His Claim&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s Theirs&lt;/p&gt;" />
