  <title>An Unexpected Match - Areta Nwosu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He&amp;#39;s ended six relationships and broken off two engagements. It&amp;#39;s her job to find him a new girlfriend but she wants him for herself. Big-hearted divorcee matchmaker, Farida Yusuf has a job to do. Find a match for her prestigious client: Kurt Achike, a half-Nigerian, half-German god with curly hair and a dimpled, bad boy smile. Kurt is of royal blood, first of the four heart-stoppingly attractive sons of infamous and controversial Zik Achike. There&amp;#39;s no doubt that he is the kind of man most women would want. There&amp;#39;s just one tiny problem. Kurt has a habit of breaking engagements. Nicknamed the Breaker of Hearts by the public, Kurt has broken off engagements to two women. And now he needs Farida&amp;#39;s help. Farida has to find him a girlfriend, even though just the thought of him empties her lungs of air and leaves her breathless. But how will she ever be able to introduce him to another woman when she wants him for herself? Plus: adventures and scandals of the four infamous sons of Zik, a dog-napping, an illegitimate baby on the way, family secrets and a contract killer named Mr. Nuclear, a boat-trip to a drug kingpin&amp;#39;s house... An Unexpected Match is a juicy, hard-to-put-down mix of drama, romance and suspense." />
