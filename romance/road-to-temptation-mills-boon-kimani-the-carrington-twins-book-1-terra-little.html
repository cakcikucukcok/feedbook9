  <title>Road To Temptation (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Carrington Twins, Book 1) - Terra Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Destination: Love&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The disappearance of a state politician’s teenage daughter sends missing-persons consultant Elise Carrington into uncharted territory. Especially when the independent PI is forced to partner up with Broderick Cannon, who insists on working the high-profile case his way. As they come to terms with each other, Elise can’t let her intense attraction to the sexy, infuriating ex-Secret Service agent interfere with their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joining forces with a beautiful woman on a search-and-rescue isn’t Broderick’s usual style. But he has his own reasons for signing on, which ups the ante even as he and Elise give in to an overwhelming desire. As they chase down leads across the Midwest, Broderick must confront an unresolved personal tragedy that still haunts him. Will he find the answers he’s looking for? Or will his lonely pursuit of justice cost them a bright future together?&lt;/p&gt;
