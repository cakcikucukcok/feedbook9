  <title>At His Mercy - Shelly Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A professor and his student fall into an all-consuming forbidden love affair in this edgy erotic suspense with killer plot twists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  One last, no-strings night of indulgence. That&#39;s all Tristan wants before he begins a much-needed new chapter in his life. Instead he finds an innocent angel in pink who brings him to his knees. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Isabella is done hiding from the world . . . and her haunting memories. Discovering courage in the arms of a perfect stranger, she finally lets go and sheds her inhibitions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  To Isabella&#39;s shock, she soon learns that Tristan is more than her mystery man-he&#39;s her professor. But Tristan isn&#39;t the only person who&#39;s found Isabella on campus. A dark figure from her past has come back for her. Now Tristan will risk anything to protect Isabella . . . even if it costs him his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;I was at Shelly Bell&#39;s mercy from page one. This novel sucked me in, and didn&#39;t let me go until the very last sexy page. This book had some of the hottest scenes I&#39;ve ever read. 10 stars!&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Alessandra Torre" />
