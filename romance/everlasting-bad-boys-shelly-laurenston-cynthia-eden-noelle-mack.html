  <title>Everlasting Bad Boys - Shelly Laurenston, Cynthia Eden, Noelle Mack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They&#39;re bad boys--with that little something extra. Sexy, wild, out-of-this-world talents that can leave any woman feeling weak at the knees (among other body parts), they&#39;re the ones to call when you want pleasure that lasts.  .  .and lasts.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  Can&#39;t Get Enough   Shelly Laurenston&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Even for a dragon, Ailean the Wicked has a bad reputation. For 150 years he&#39;s been renowned for his fighting prowess, but now he&#39;s got a new conquest in mind--a gorgeous dragoness known as Shalin the Innocent. Ailean suspects she&#39;s anything but. And while he&#39;s saving her from her enemies, he plans to prove that, even in human form, a bad-boy dragon can show a girl a good time that&#39;s truly off the scale.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;    Spellbound  Cynthia Eden&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    No witch in her right mind would summon an immortal soul-hunter to her aid, but Serena Tyme needs Luis D&#39;Amil&#39;s help to destroy the warlock who&#39;s stalking her coven. And she&#39;s willing to pay any price he names.  .  .especially when the tall, dark, sexy-as-hell assassin shows her he can work some sensual magic of his own.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;    Turn Me On  Noelle Mack&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Finally, Beth Danforth has found a man who can flip her switch. That&#39;s because supersexy Justin Watts, CEO of SpectraSign, is literally made of light. His dazzling, custom-built body can&#39;t ever wear out. And talk about energy--Beth can&#39;t get enough of the guy. The sex is electrifying. The love will never fade away.  .  ." />
