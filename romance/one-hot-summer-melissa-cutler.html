  <title>One Hot Summer - Melissa Cutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Dulcet, Texas, home of the legendary Briscoe Ranch Resort, where one woman will discover that even love is bigger in the Lone Star State.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity wedding planner Remedy Lane is Hollywood royalty--until a scandal sends her packing to the wilds of Texas. She has a knack for leaving disaster in her wake, but she&#39;s determined to reboot her career at Briscoe Ranch, a luxury resort known for extravagant weddings. Little does she know that weddings don&#39;t happen at the resort without the approval of the town&#39;s cowboy-swaggering, too-hot-for-his-own-good fire chief, Micah Garrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE HOT SUMMER&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Micah knows trouble when he sees it, and all it takes is one glimpse of Remedy&#39;s princess airs for him to know he&#39;s met his match. Too bad he can&#39;t stop thinking about her--even when she brings about one disaster after another at the resort. He and Remedy clash at every turn, but they can&#39;t stop the sparks flying between them. They come from such different worlds--does love stand a chance or will this fire burn too hot for either of them to handle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the first book in Melissa Cutler&#39;s One and Only Texas series!&lt;/p&gt;" />
