          &lt;strong&gt;A convenient wife… An inconvenient love…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Francesca walked into the room and Guy Dymoke was mesmerized. But she was pregnant with Guy&#39;s brother&#39;s baby. An impossible situation…and Guy had been hiding his feelings ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Years later, Francesca is now a widow, and when the will is read she&#39;s stunned to discover she&#39;s been placed into Guy&#39;s safekeeping…as his convenient wife! Guy wants to give Francesca and her son all the care in the world. He also yearns to tell her how much he really loves her. But he&#39;ll wait for the day that she gives her love freely in return….&lt;/p&gt;
