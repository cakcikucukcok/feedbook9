  <title>Leave Me Where I Lie - Ellen Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;There is no way you can read this
book and not feel the pain and joys of Mattie Posey as she lives in the
aftermath of the Civil War on a farm in Mississippi.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The times are hard and she has to do the work
of a man on the family farm, as she has no brothers to help with the farm
work.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;When her religiously prejudiced
parents interfere with her love for a catholic boy, Matties pain devastates
her soul and threatens to break her spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Matties manic/depressive mother,
Annie, vacillates between extreme emotional lows and highs, which cause her to
be very strict, and a harsh disciplinarian.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Matties father, Wade, is a gentle, kind man.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;However, he does not take a stand against his
wifes extreme discipline of the children.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Mattie must assume her mothers duties and care for her when she is
incapacitated by her depression.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;A rogue panther is lured to the
Posey house by the smell of fresh, butchered pork which hangs in the
smokehouse.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The familys life is
endangered when the dogs corner the panther under the kitchen but Annies quick
thinking and action saves her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Matties love for her horse,
Prince and her confidence in his speed entice her to enter the horse race at
the Neshoba County Fair.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Her
determination to prove Prince as the fastest horse in the community causes her
to break rules in order to win the race.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The Posey family and the black
family, who shares their surname, have been bound in a close relationship since
Wade and Joshua were small children.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The
trials of rugged farm life and the illnesses and deaths due to a lack of
medical care bind them even closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;When Mattie falls in love with
Frank Haney, a boy of the Catholic faith, her prejudiced parents take drastic
measures to prevent their marriage, so they decide to elope.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The Ku Klux Klan interferes with
Wades efforts to reward his faithful, black friend with a deed to part of his
farm.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;When a cross is burned in his
front yard he visits each of the Klan members and gives them a piece of the
charred cross.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Years later, Mattie meets John
Mayo, who is twenty years her senior and when he proposes marriage to her she
has difficulty accepting because of her love for Frank.&lt;/p&gt;
