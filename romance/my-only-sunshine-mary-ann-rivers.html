  <title>My Only Sunshine - Mary Ann Rivers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Mary Ann Rivers&amp;rsquo;s Burnside Series returns with&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;My Only Sunshine&lt;/i&gt;, a heart-rending and satisfying romantic novella featuring a musician who appeared as a minor character in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Laugh&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Lake owes his label an album&amp;mdash;and has for months. Alone in his farmhouse studio outside of Lakefield, Ohio, he hears the music, but he won&amp;rsquo;t write it down. All the songs remind him of&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fifteen years ago, Mallory Evans was a fairy-haired warrior-poet. John couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why no one in high school noticed.&amp;nbsp;He&amp;nbsp;noticed, and he came to her window every evening before darkness came and the private violence of her home life threatened. Then, inevitably, one terrifying night broke the sweet spell between them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen Mallory since, but he&amp;rsquo;s looked for her&amp;mdash;in his audiences, in his dreams.&amp;nbsp;Now he decides that if he can&amp;rsquo;t find the inspiration to finish an album, he can at least find Mallory and finish what has always been between them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Rivers&amp;rsquo;s stories have been hailed by&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Grace Burrowes as &amp;ldquo;superbly written&amp;rdquo; and listed among&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s best ebooks of the year. With&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;My Only Sunshine&lt;/i&gt;, Rivers gives readers another glimpse into the rich contemporary world of Lakefield, Ohio, and the Burnsides.&lt;/b&gt;" />

A heart-rending and satisfying romantic novella featuring a musician who appeared as a minor character in Laugh ... in the hands of a less talented writer.

It was all nice, but I felt frustrated that the hero, a musician, didn't figure himself out much. I wish that he had time to get stronger in sharing his feeling, in letting himself play the music in his heart.<br /><b><i>My Only Sunshine by Mary Ann Rivers - Goodreads</i></b> | Mary Ann Rivers’s Burnside Series returns with My Only Sunshine, a heart-rending and satisfying romantic novella featuring a musician who appeared as a minor character in Laugh.
