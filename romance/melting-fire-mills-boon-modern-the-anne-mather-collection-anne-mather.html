  <title>Melting Fire (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (The Anne Mather Collection) - Anne Mather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Mills &amp; Boon are excited to present The Anne Mather Collection – the complete works by this classic author made available to download for the very first time! These books span six decades of a phenomenal writing career, and every story is available to read unedited and untouched from their original release. &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Making the break…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Olivia owes her step-brother Richard everything - but now she is an adult, and determined to make her own way in the world. And yet Richard seems just as determined not to let her go… He has been very generous, but that doesn’t give him the right to dictate how she should live now!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Olivia knows that the only way to solve her problem is to leave Richard altogether – but why is she finding it so difficult to break away? Her feelings for Richard are clearly more complicated than she’d first thought…&lt;/p&gt;
