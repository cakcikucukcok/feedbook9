  <title>Hawk&#39;s Way Collection: Faron And Garth: Hawk&#39;s Way: Garth / Hawk&#39;s Way: Faron (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Joan Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Joan Johnston’s beloved Whitelaw boys have been branding hearts for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Celebrate the return of Hawk’s Way’s sexiest cowboys with these classic tales…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Hawk&#39;s Way: Faron&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faron Whitelaw had some nerve calling Belinda Prescott a princess. A nearly bankrupt ranch was hardly a castle, and Faron, an ill-tempered cowboy who’d inherited half her kingdom, was certainly no prince. Faron became spitting mad when Belinda informed him about the truth of his parentage: he wasn’t one of the Whitelaws of Texas. He wanted to believe that she was nothing more than a gold digger, but all she seemed to want was him…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Hawk&#39;s Way: Garth&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Garth Whitelaw couldn’t understand why a rich Texas debutante like Candy Baylor would want to train horses. But she looked darn sexy in worn jeans with hay in her hair, so who was he to judge? Candy had no idea why Garth was suddenly so agreeable, but she wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. Besides, her instructors in school had never been so ruggedly handsome as this wrangler…and she wouldn’t mind engaging in some horseplay!&lt;/p&gt;
