  <title>Denying the Duke - Callie Hutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lord Alexander Pemberton, second son of the Duke of Bedford, has spent his life being reminded of his less than revered position in the family. So when he loses the love of his life, Lady Patience, to an arranged marriage with his brother, a heartbroken Alex joins the military. Four years later, he&#39;s called home to assume the title after his brother&#39;s death. Though he&#39;s unprepared for his new responsibilities, Alex is stunned to discover that Patience never married his brother. And that he&#39;s now expected to marry her... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once carefree and innocent, years of bullying at the hands of her fiance and her father have left Patience Browning jaded. And now that her father expects her to marry Alex, she knows promises made in their youth aren&#39;t enough to overcome what life has done to them. Alex is not the same man he was before war, and she can&#39;t marry someone who doesn&#39;t love her. But real love can grow and transform, if only Patience could believe that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Lords &amp; Ladies in Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Seducing the Marquess&lt;br&gt;* Marrying the Wrong Earl&lt;br&gt;* Denying the Duke&lt;br&gt;* Wagering For Miss Blake&lt;br&gt;* Captivating the Earl&lt;/p&gt;" />
