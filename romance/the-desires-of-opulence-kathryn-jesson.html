  <title>The Desires of Opulence - Kathryn Jesson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Under normal circumstances, Katelyn Ross would be delighted to travel back
to her hometown of Niagara-on-the-Lake. She loved the beautiful lakeside
community, steeped in history and lovingly preserved. It was what inspired her
to become an architect. Sadly, the circumstances she found herself in were not
normal; her mother was dead, the tragic victim of a motor vehicle collision.
Grief-stricken, Katelyn is intent on quickly settling the estate and returning to
her comfortable and successful life in Vancouver. Shes not looking forward to
reconnecting with Adam Wilson  their breakup had been less than amicable
those seven years previous  but the reunion in unavoidable. Adam is her
mothers investment broker. To Katelyns surprise, Adam isnt the same man she
once knew, and despite herself, she is captivated by his transformation. Adams
boyish good looks, flamboyant personality, and opulent lifestyle arent the only
changes in his character, and Katelyn is quickly led down a path of passion,
deceit, and heartache.&lt;b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Her life crumbling around her, Katelyn reaches out across the miles to her close
friend and employer, Dan Neufeld. Stinging from a recent divorce after twenty
years of marriage, the true romantic lying dormant within Dan is stirred when he
realizes the impact Katelyns absence is having on his life, and he is forced to
reassess his relationship with her and the friendship they share.&lt;b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adam Wilsons lust for the finer things in life has come with a heavy price tag.
His greed wins out over commonsense and he partners with two businessmen
who prove to be more corrupt than he is. Underestimating their power and
ruthlessness, Adams life is placed in peril with little chance for redemption.&lt;/P&gt;" />
