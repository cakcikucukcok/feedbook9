      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Little Dare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Shelly Brockman walks into his office, Sheriff Dare Westmoreland can almost taste the sweet, steamy passion they&#39;d once shared. Then she informs him that he is the father of her son, the unruly preteen Dare arrested earlier that day, and his fantasies turn to fury. Shelly has returned to her Georgia hometown to get her son away from the mean streets of Los Angeles, and she hopes that getting to know his father will do her child a world of good. But will being so close to Dare&amp;mdash;the only man to ever make Shelly&#39;s heartbeat race&amp;mdash;reopen old wounds, or will this be her last chance to secure his love forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thorn&#39;s Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One sizzling kiss from Thorn Westmoreland isn&#39;t enough to convince Tara Matthews to risk her heart again&amp;hellip;or is it? The beautiful doctor and the hard-driving motorcycle tycoon mix like oil and water. Why, then, can&#39;t Tara erase the memory of the sexy racer from her head, or thoughts of his passionate caresses from her body? Thorn has wanted Tara since the day they met. His plan is to seduce the prickly doctor and indulge in a casual affair. But before he can savor the success of their passion, she turns the tables on him. Now instead of working her out of his system, Thorn is hell-bent on winning Tara&#39;s love&amp;hellip;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
