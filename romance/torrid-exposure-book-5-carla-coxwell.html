  <title>Torrid Exposure - Book 5 - Carla Coxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 5&amp;nbsp;of the Torrid Exposure New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Billionaire New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April must put the pieces of her life story together before it is too late to take down a mad billionaire and his lust for power but will the target on her back prove to be deadly?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With Spencer&amp;rsquo;s daughter, Aria, missing and Kevin hot on their trail, April feels as if things have flown completely off the rails. After Kevin lies and tells Bennett that April was kissing Anderson, she finds herself struggling to plan out her next move.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
As work and life go on, April knows that she has to help her sister find her daughter and make sure Kevin can no longer hurt anyone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Navigating through Kevin&amp;rsquo;s history, April might just find enough of the puzzle pieces to solve the mystery of what Kevin could be hiding and how to take him down. Will Bennett help her work against his own father or will he be more concerned about the company?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the conclusion to April&amp;rsquo;s story, she must put the pieces together before it is too late to take down a mad billionaire and his lust for power. In doing so though, will the target on her back prove to be deadly?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
