  <title>Mom, I Need You - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had been thinking of my mother in less than maternal terms for years. Ever since I was a little kid, I&amp;#39;ve wanted her. Not until she came after me with a belt because I had refused to listen to her on a certain matter, did she realize that she wanted me too. After wailing on my ass with a belt, I turned around and showed her the evidence of her so called discipline. I was rock hard and she was practically drooling for me. Guess who&amp;#39;s on top now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of asking my mom to help me but she would flip out, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. I mean, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t flip out if Mom saw my junk unless, of course, I got a raging boner from her touch. I&amp;rsquo;ve dreamed of that for a long time. Mom is still way hot and she doesn&amp;rsquo;t date. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t she ever want sex? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t she ever want to feel a man&amp;rsquo;s cock deep inside her? Has she like gone into the change of life or something? Nah, that&amp;rsquo;s impossible. She&amp;rsquo;s only thirty-something. She&amp;rsquo;s still so fucking hot. My cock is getting hard just thinking about her and I still have time before she gets home from work to yank one off. I really should get a girlfriend, but the thought of it makes me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m abandoning my Mom. And I can never do that. At least my eighteen year old mind can&amp;rsquo;t grapple with it. Maybe when she starts getting older and she&amp;rsquo;s not so enticing I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to move on from this obsession. And that&amp;rsquo;s what it is. A painful obsession of wanting my own mother sexually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m fucked." />
