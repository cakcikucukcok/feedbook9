  <title>The Perfect Lover - Stephanie Laurens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Never let it be said that a Cynster male can&#39;t face up to the one unassailable truth: A successful marriage gives life its fullest meaning. To all of English society, Simon Frederick Cynster has a perfect life&amp;#8212;one of enormous wealth and impeccable social status. His lean handsomeness turns the heads of na&amp;#239;ve debutantes, while his sensual allure ensures he never lacks for more sophisticated partners for a night, or more, of pleasure. Yet despite all of this, Simon knows that there is something&amp;#8212;or rather someone&amp;#8212;missing in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve true contentment, Simon must find a lady accomplished enough to be his wife, someone who will spend her days as a member of one of England&#39;s most influential families ... and her nights pursuing duties of a more private&amp;#8212;and personal&amp;#8212;nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Simon knows what to expect if he reveals his intention to choose a bride; nothing could be more tiresome than having every blushing miss on the marriage mart thrust upon him. So he discreetly begins his search at a house party at Glossup Hall . . . and is astonished that the lady who immediately captures his interest is Portia Ashford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon has never considered Portia as a potential wife. He&#39;s known the raven-haired beauty since childhood; she&#39;s willfully independent and has always claimed to be uninterested in marriage. But an unexpectedly heated kiss abruptly alters the rules of their decade-long interaction. Soon they begin to long for the moments they can spend in each other&#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all is not as it seems at Glossup Hall. As Simon and Portia begin to explore the depths of their mutual passion, a shocking murder is committed ... and it appears that the next victim will be Portia herself. And even more shocking than the fact that a murderer secretly walks among them is the realization that all of Simon&#39;s considerable strength and influence may not be enough to protect Portia&amp;#8212;his once and always perfect lover . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
