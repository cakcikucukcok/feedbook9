  <title>Favors Captured - Belinda Brolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the frenzy that is an average moment in LaGuardia Airport, two lives are about to change. Is it a mere coincidence that Marco, a military man en route to his next assignment, happens to catch a glimpse of an enchanting Cajun beauty rushing on her own exciting journeyor is it fate?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To satisfy her desire for the arts, lovely Jojo Jypsie de Bour has left her beloved sugar cane plantation behind to pursue an education at New Yorks renowned Art Institute.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Captivated, Marco quickly formulates a plan. He enlists his military contacts to watch over her until he returns. Initially captivated by her beauty, his obsession only intensifies when he learns of her loyalty, devotion, and purity of heart. For Marco, a soldier tainted by horror and loss, she is the embodiment of all that is good in the world, the only glimmer of light in his dark, elusive, murderous, and secretive life. After twelve years of active duty, he desperately desires to find someone with whom he can share a normal life, a concept that is as alien to him as it is curative.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Will the passion that unfolds be a binding force to connect them?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For Marco, will government obstacles prove to be the real lure of seduction from which he may never escape?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When love, loyalty, murder, and obsession spin out of control, is murder for love the ultimate action of redemption?&lt;/p&gt;" />
