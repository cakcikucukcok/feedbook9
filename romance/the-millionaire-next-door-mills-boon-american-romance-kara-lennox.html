  <title>The Millionaire Next Door (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Kara Lennox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Millionaire Meets His Match…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forced to take a vacation, Boston&#39;s hottest bachelor and biggest workaholic traveled to sleepy Cottonwood, Texas. All Hudson Stack wanted was a little R and R, but then he met his all-tooalluring neighbor Amanda Galloway. Maybe it was the hot Texas sun that had him yearning to unpin this small-town Rapunzel&#39;s hair and feel it slide through his fingers….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Amanda liked her life predictable, Hudson coaxed her out of her cautious world with mouthwatering kisses. But before he knew it, Amanda had stolen his heart and had him rethinking his bachelor ways. The only problem was she didn&#39;t know he was a famous surgeon. Would the big-city doctor return to his lonely life, or could he convince Amanda to trust him and take the ultimate risk–of believing in forever?&lt;/p&gt;
