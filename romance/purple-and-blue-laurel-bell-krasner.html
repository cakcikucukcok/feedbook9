  <title>Purple and Blue - Laurel Bell-Krasner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if you could smell, taste, hear, see and touch, but not know? What would you do if the only thing you could prove was how you felt? What would you do if the facts were in front of you, but nobody else could see them? What if you were innocent, but behind your back, people were plotting something bigger than high school drama? What would you have done differently to prevent it? Would you have told them the truth, or would you have tried harder to hide it? 
Not all of this is true, but the struggles are entirely real and based on an incredible true story. Not all of it happened exactly like this. But you get the idea, dont you? And just to let you know, when you think this is over, youll be wrong. In reality, when two hearts stop beating, two souls will be together again. Or at least that possibility can exist because this is fictionisnt it?
