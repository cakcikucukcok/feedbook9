&lt;br /&gt;
An unyielding human with deadly skills from generations of training versus a dangerous werewolf with a heart of compassion. Who wins over Eliza&amp;rsquo;s heart?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This complete set contains Books 1 to 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza&amp;rsquo;s life consisted of reporting on boring, crowd-pleasing events, like their country livestock fair. With the arrival of two handsome brothers, the lives of Eliza and her best friend, Melissa, are shaken to the core. For Eliza, the arrival of this new man becomes a test of her relationship with her current boyfriend, who she&amp;rsquo;s been happily living with for over six years. Does Hayden, a complete stranger, really wield the power to make Eliza reconsider her relationship with Andrew?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The threat of a new pack arises and the forgiveness of an unintentional murder gives new light to the hearts of all. Among the pain and suffering, the bonds grow deeper, weaving a strong alliance between human and werewolf alike, ready to face the future. Meanwhile, Andrew&amp;#39;s true colors come to the surface, leaving Eliza with a difficult choice to make. Does she stay with the man who she has already devoted seven years of her life to or does she choose Hayden, the dark and dangerous stranger, who has stirred the fires of passion within her?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza has finally met the man of her dreams and is starting a new life. She is confident that there is nothing in this world that can go wrong. What she doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that she isn&amp;rsquo;t in her world anymore. She is in a world surrounded by supernatural beings that she thought only existed in myths. So when both her life and that of her unborn child is threatened by Deimos, an all-powerful supernatural being, she is at odds whether she has been taking her perfect life for granted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naomi is forced to leave her family to begin her training in Ireland, to replace Deimos as the Wolf Overlord. This brings her to the attention of a great enemy. The enemy has come up with a master plan to break the treaty between hunter and wolf and they will need Naomi to break that treaty. They are planning on using Naomi as their secret weapon against the wolves. How will they get Naomi to agree to all of this? How will they get her to abandon all her morals and beliefs, not to mention her entire family and her friends?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having been fed a poison to forget her life prior to Colt&amp;#39;s loving, Naomi struggles to hold onto her faith as he lay in a coma in a hospital. She is greeted by an old friend whom assists her in restoring her previous memories. Following her heart, she trains once more with her masters, getting a unique handle on the ability to transform. She follows her fate that brings her face to face with Deimos. Will her training be enough to defeat and rid the world of Deimos once and for all?&lt;br /&gt;
