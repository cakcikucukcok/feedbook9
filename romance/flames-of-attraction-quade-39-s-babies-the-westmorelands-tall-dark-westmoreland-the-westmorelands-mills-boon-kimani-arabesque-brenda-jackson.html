  <title>Flames Of Attraction: Quade&#39;s Babies (The Westmorelands) / Tall, Dark…Westmoreland! (The Westmorelands) (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Two classic Westmoreland novels from New York Times bestselling author Brenda Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;QUADE’S BABIES&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quade Westmoreland&#39;s one-night love affair with Cheyenne brands him body and soul, but he never even learns her last name. Almost a year later, driven by sensual memories and one incriminating photo, the sexy operative finally tracks her down—and discovers three little babies who look just like him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learning he is a father makes Quade even more determined: he plans to claim Cheyenne Steele as his very own. Shockingly, the irresistible beauty seems intent on refusing him. But Cheyenne and their children are now part of the Westmoreland destiny and Quade vows to fight for a future together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TALL, DARK…WESTMORELAND!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She longs for a taste of the wild and reckless. And Olivia Jeffries gets her chance when she meets a handsome stranger at a masquerade ball. The attraction is instant, and the electricity is volatile. But days later she discovers that her new lover is none other than Reginald Westmoreland, her father&#39;s most-hated rival.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She vows to resist him, but Reggie is relentless in his pursuit. He will stop at nothing—not even blackmail—to get Olivia back in his bed…forever.&lt;/p&gt;
