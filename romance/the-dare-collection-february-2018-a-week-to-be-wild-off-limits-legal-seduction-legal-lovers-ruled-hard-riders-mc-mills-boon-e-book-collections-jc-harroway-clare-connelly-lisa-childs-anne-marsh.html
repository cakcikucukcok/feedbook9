        &lt;h2&gt;Introduce yourself to Mills &amp; Boon’s sexiest series yet!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Week to be Wild&lt;/em&gt; by JC Harroway&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She’ll play his game – but only by her rules!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alex Lancaster is an adrenaline junkie. He’s also a sexy British billionaire who should come with his own warning signs. When Libby insists she is done with men who live on the edge, Alex coaxes her out of her comfort zone – professionally and very, very personally. Libby’s taking a high-stakes gamble, but the pay-off could win her everything…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Off Limits&lt;/em&gt; by Clare Connelly&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;With chemistry this hot, it’s worth getting burned…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Jack Grant is totally off-limits to Gemma Picton. He’s wild, deliciously dangerous…and her boss. When working late turns X-rated, it’s better than her wildest imaginings – and Gemma’s imagined a lot! But Jack has major emotional baggage, so when she starts wanting to heal his heart as well as enjoy his body she knows she’s in big trouble…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Seduction&lt;/em&gt; by Lisa Childs&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Resigning might be the sexiest thing she’s ever done…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quitting her job puts executive assistant Bette Monroe in a very compromising position. With ten days left, powerhouse lawyer Simon Kramer is working her late into the night… and seducing her into oblivion! While he’s convinced she’s selling business secrets, the bombshell she’s keeping secret would shock him more. Does she bare all…or keep him guessing?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruled&lt;/em&gt; by Anne Marsh&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Complete opposites who share the same burning passion!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaxon Brady of the Hard Riders MC has sworn to protect Evie Kent from a rival gang. His hard muscles and black leather motorcycle boots are a sharp contrast to the girly dresses Evie wears for her successful party-planning business. Their instant attraction is magnetic, and their lust keeps them glued to each other’s side…but is it a dangerous distraction?&lt;/p&gt;
