When an enemy from the past resurfaces with an ultimatum--complete a simple task or Sam dies--they&#39;re backed into a corner. The goal? Kill a demon called Malphi. The problem? Jax&#39;s demon, Azirak, has no intention of letting that happen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;To gain a chance at heaven, they&#39;ll need to embrace hell...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Eternal Balance Book 1: Ruined &lt;br&gt;Eternal Balance Book 2: Embrace&lt;br&gt;Eternal Balance Book 3: Released&lt;/p&gt;" />
