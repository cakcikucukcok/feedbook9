      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Four fantastic romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undone by the Billionaire Duke&lt;/em&gt; by Caitlin Crews&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The brazen antics of Hugo, Duke of Grovesmoor and the string of women to grace his bed are tabloid gold. But Eleanor Andrews, newly hired to care for the duke&#39;s young ward, refuses to see him as anything but her boss.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Majesty&#39;s Temporary Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Annie West&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the illegitimate secret daughter of royalty, Cat&#39;s life has been far from luxurious. After years of bullying, she&#39;s set against a return to her childhood home. But her princess half sister has mysteriously disappeared ahead of her engagement to charismatic King Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bound by the Millionaire&#39;s Ring&lt;/em&gt; by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Millionaire racing driver Ramon Sauveterre is no stranger to fame, but he&#39;ll do just about anything to keep the spotlight off his family. Including propose a decidedly short-term engagement to his gorgeous head of PR, Isidora Garcia!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Virgin&#39;s Shock Baby &lt;/em&gt;by Heidi Rice&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Vulnerable Megan Whittaker has orders to find out if tycoon Dario De Rossi plans to acquire her father&#39;s business. Reluctantly, she agrees, but doesn&#39;t expect to be so distracted by their searing chemistry that she ends up in his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
