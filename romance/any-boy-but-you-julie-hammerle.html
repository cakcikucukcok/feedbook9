  <title>Any Boy but You - Julie Hammerle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elena Chestnut has been chatting with an anonymous boy late into the night. It&#39;s a very You&#39;ve Got Mail situation, and she has no idea who he is. He can&#39;t be Oliver Prince, hot-and-bashful son of the family running the rival sporting goods store. Their fancy sales strategies are driving Elena&#39;s family out of business. Elena&#39;s mystery boy has teamed up with her in their latest sales strategy, an augmented reality game, to help her win the grand-prize plane tickets. Money&#39;s so tight Elena&#39;s going to miss senior year spring break with her friends if she can&#39;t win this game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The girl Oliver&#39;s fallen head-over-heels for online had better not be Elena Chestnut. She&#39;s his angry, vindictive Latin tutor, the daughter of his dad&#39;s business rival, and the one girl he&#39;d never even think of kissing. She&#39;s definitely not his online crush, because that girl is funny, sweet, and perfect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Oliver asks to reveal their names at the Valentine&#39;s Day dance, their IRL relationship will either ruin what they have online, or they&#39;ll discover just how thin the line between love and hate really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains swearing, snowball fights, and sexual tension that could melt the North Pole. Read at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the North Pole, Minnesota series&lt;br&gt;Any Boy but You&lt;br&gt;Artificial Sweethearts&lt;br&gt;Approximately Yours&lt;/p&gt;" />
