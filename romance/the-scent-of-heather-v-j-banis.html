  <title>The Scent of Heather - V. J. Banis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maggie came with her sister Rebecca to Heather House, to recover from the drowning deaths of their two husbands. They thought a few months in the country would be wonderful therapy. But the house seems to be haunted by the ghost of its one-time owner, Heather Lambert, who (it is said) waits in the tower room for the return of her errant husband. And when Maggie discovers the portrait of Heather hidden in the cellar, the woman from the past seems to come alive for her. She sees someone just out of the range of her vision, and she smells the scent of heather in the air... Another thrilling tale of romantic suspense by a master storyteller." />
