  <title>Broken Wings Need Healing - a Pair of Mail Order Bride Romances - Doreen Milstead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mail Order Bride: High Society Woman &amp; The Wolves, is about a high society woman in NYC who gets sent off to Oregon to be the bride of a lonely outpost operator.  He is as stunned by her beauty when she gets off the train, as she is by the wilderness surrounding his cabin and home.  She doesn&#39;t know how to make a fire or even sweep the floor and her many trunks of fine clothing fill up his small cabin.  Amidst the howls of wolves surrounding them in the darkness of the forest, both will have to decide if they can ever make a match.  Mail Order Bride: Saving Lonely Crippled Thomas, is about Thomas, who lives virtually alone in his house in Pennsylvania with only his cousin to look after him. His legs were damaged in a railway accident and the only way he can get around his house is by crawling, or by means of an awkward chaise lounge &amp; prototype wheelchair that his cousin pushes." />
