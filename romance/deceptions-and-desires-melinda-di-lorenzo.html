  <title>Deceptions and Desires - Melinda Di Lorenzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Well, if I&#39;m going to die, at least it&#39;s under a man who looks like that. And feels like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Funny the things that leap to mind when your apartment has just exploded in front of you. Jane Greene wasn&#39;t always her name. But she left the original behind the night she finally killed her vicious mobbed-up husband and then bolted.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Eight years lying low. Now the only thing standing&amp;#151;lying, really&amp;#151;between her and a crew of vengeful Abruzzi family goons is a man. He says his name is Leo. He wants to save her even more than he just plain wants her. Adrenaline and lust are powerful allies. So they run, together.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But more potent than the sheen of sweat between Jane and Leo is a secret. A past that one remembers with grief and regret, and that the other can&#39;t begin to guess. Both know that the Abruzzis cannot be stopped. That a tryst is not trust. And that no one will escape unscathed." />
