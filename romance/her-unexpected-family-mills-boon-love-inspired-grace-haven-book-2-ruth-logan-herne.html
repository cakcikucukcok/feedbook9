          &lt;strong&gt;A Family to Love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emily Gallagher and Grant McCarthy are planning a wedding together—just not their own. Emily’s well-structured life is turned upside-down when her company is hired to help Grant put together his deployed sister’s nuptials. Because as Emily spends more time with Grant and his adorable twins, she can&#39;t help but daydream about being at the altar herself. But Emily&#39;s ex-beauty queen status brings Grant memories of his children&#39;s appearance-obsessed mother—a woman who walked out on their family. For a future with Emily, can Grant escape the confines of his painful past? If he can, the next wedding they plan could be their own…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Grace Haven: A town full of heart, happiness and home.&lt;/strong&gt;
