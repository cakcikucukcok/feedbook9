  <title>Hotel California - erotic short story - Julie Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Joe studied himself in the mirror. He looked good with Fred’s hand around his cock. Really good and really hot. He briefly pondered how sexy he would look with Freddie’s lips around it instead. He didn’t have to wonder for long, because Fred finally bent down his head and licked Joe’s tip.&quot;
Joe and Fred have driven from LA to Vegas and are now heading back through the desert. Joe curses Fred for the idea, as he is the one driving, while his lover happily snores away. When a motel finally appears, Joe’s laughter wakes Fred who’s not late to join in when he sees the name of the place.
In the master suite, complete with a mirror above the bed, their dirty talk turns into erotic action and they wonder why anyone would ever want to leave Hotel California...
