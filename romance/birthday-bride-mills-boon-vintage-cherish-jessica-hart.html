  <title>Birthday Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Jessica Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;The BIG Event&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Thirty–the age for marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sexy, glamorous…Claudia tried to think of three good things about being thirty as she sat on the plan on her way to celebrate her birthday. Well, her fellow passenger, David Cool-as-a-Cucumber Stirling, certainly wasn&#39;t one of them!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But they were stuck with each other whether they liked it or not. Worse, for the next few weeks they had to pretend to be husband and wife! The situation wasn&#39;t ideal, but they did have something in common–he was about to turn forty to her thirty–and he wasn&#39;t bad-looking, either. And so, perhaps, sexy, glamorous and &lt;em&gt;wed&lt;/em&gt; was right for her time of life?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;One special occasion–that changes your life, forever!&lt;/strong&gt;
