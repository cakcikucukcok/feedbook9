  <title>Madas’s Falling Star: Featuring Madas’s Unexpected Gift - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Madas&amp;rsquo;s Unexpected Gift&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can a small reptile from another world save the Princess he has adopted?&lt;br /&gt;
L&amp;rsquo;eon, a Chameleon Lightning Lizard, awakens to find that his planet was destroyed by an unidentified force. Trapped in an iron-ore prison hurtling through space, he is lost and alone until an unfamiliar planet&amp;rsquo;s gravitational pull draws him to its surface &amp;mdash; and he is freed by an enchanting alien who he quickly adopts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a meteorite falls from the sky, Princess Madas Tralang rushes to claim the prized and potentially valuable space rock for herself. She is startled to discover an unusual creature huddled inside. Touched by the creature&amp;rsquo;s soulful eyes and unique features, she vows to protect the extraordinary reptile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Madas is unaware that she has befriended one of the most ferocious and feared species in the known galaxies. After all, who would ever believe that something so cute could be so deadly? Perhaps, someone should have warned Madas&amp;rsquo;s unwelcome suitor about L&amp;rsquo;eon before he decided to try and claim her!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
***&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Madas&amp;rsquo;s Falling Star&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Gril Tal Mod is destined to be the next Supreme Leader of the Tearnats &amp;mdash; if he survives long enough to ascend to the throne.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gril was supposed to be on a routine training exercise, but his flight goes horribly wrong when engine trouble forces him to land his fighter in a remote mountainous region. Once stranded on the ground, Gril discovers the malfunction was no accident &amp;mdash; and he isn&amp;rsquo;t alone. He can sense someone watching him from the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Princess Madas Tralang&amp;rsquo;s curiosity always seems to get her into trouble. When Madas spies an unusual object streaking across the sky before crashing near her location, she believes it is a good omen. After all, she found her pet, L&amp;rsquo;eon, the last time an object fell from the sky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her hopes of finding something valuable are dashed when instead she sees a big, and rather ugly, Tearnat warrior. Though there is something about him&amp;hellip; something magnetic, it&amp;rsquo;s his spaceship that she really wants. It is just what she has been searching for &amp;mdash; a means to escape the dreary life expected of her!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The giant warrior pilot of the spaceship isn&amp;rsquo;t going to give it up easily, however, and Madas soon finds herself locked in a battle of wits and skill with the strange warrior, but they are not the only players on the field. Danger surrounds Madas and Gril &amp;mdash; both from Madas&amp;rsquo;s clan and from the saboteur who is determined to see Gril dead. Can the Prince of the Tearnats and a small, but deadly alien pet, defeat their foes and save Madas before time runs out, or will Gril&amp;rsquo;s growing love for a curious Princess doom them both?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of romance and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
