  <title>Only With You - Nicole McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The men in Nicole McLaughlin&#39;s Man Enough series are tough Alphas devoted to serving their country and the women who love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Guardsman Aiden King has been attracted to Hannah Walters for a while, but he never made a move because of her close relationship with his best friend. But when circumstances change, Aiden is surprised when his friend gives his blessing. Problem is, there&#39;s a reason he&#39;s still alone after all these years, and as much as he wants her, that secret keeps him from acting on his desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah has finally decided to wait for the kind of love you read about in books and see in movies. After her failed engagement, Aiden&#39;s unassuming support has become a touchstone for Hannah. It soon becomes apparent that he may be exactly the kind of man she&#39;s been looking for. But the closer they become, the more he keeps her at arm&#39;s length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Aiden suggests a road trip to take Hannah&#39;s mind off her troubles, the two of them go on a journey neither one expected. She just hopes that the final destination is them together for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
