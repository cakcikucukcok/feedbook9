  <title>Lighthouse - Eugenia Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First Novel in the St. Simons Trilogy
A compelling, vibrant saga of conflict, love, and a young man&#39;s search to fulfill his dreams.
In this enthralling first novel of the St. Simons Trilogy, New York Times bestselling author Eugenia Price shares the compelling story of James Gould, a young man with a passionate dream. Raised in post-Revolution Granville, Massachusetts, Gould could only imagine the beauty and warmth of lands to the south. It was there that he longed to build bridges and lighthouses from his very own design and plans. The gripping story unfolds as Gould follows his dream to the raw settlement of Bangor on the Penobscot River, to St. Simons Island off the coast of Georgia, to lawless Spanish East Florida, and back—at last and finally—to St. Simons. Along the way, he encounters hardship, peril, failure, and success, but it is the unwavering love of Janie Harris, an especially beautiful and strong-willed young woman, that fulfills his deep need for someone who can share the dream and the life he has chosen." />
