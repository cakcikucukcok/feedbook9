  <title>Barr&#39;s Meadow - Eldot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An adventure about boys ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eldot presents a fresh new novel for adults.&lt;br /&gt;The coming of age story is embedded in an&lt;br /&gt;episodic two-week summer camp full of variety and fun.&lt;br /&gt;Julian kept two scrapbooks. This special one&lt;br /&gt;has not been shared until now. It responds to&lt;br /&gt;the nostalgic pull; the happy days of youth&lt;br /&gt;are special. Perhaps you&#39;d like to relive&lt;br /&gt;some memories, or discover ones that were&lt;br /&gt;missed. This is a peek at the world of 1963,&lt;br /&gt;before the Internet and cell phones-when&lt;br /&gt;you learned by discovering things on your&lt;br /&gt;own and interacted with real people.&lt;br /&gt;Did you miss the chance to go to summer camp? This story will&lt;br /&gt;fill the gap.&lt;br /&gt;Did you go to camp but it was boring, or too short? This will make&lt;br /&gt;up for that.&lt;br /&gt;Did you go to camp, but were too inhibited to try all those things?&lt;br /&gt;Here is a memory for you to cherish.&lt;br /&gt;Or was your camp experience fabulous and terrific? See how this&lt;br /&gt;one compares!&lt;br /&gt;This story about a teen boy discovering love is not the usual coming of age&lt;br /&gt;drama-this one banishes the prejudice and the bad guys and shows the&lt;br /&gt;comic side. A lot of boys frolic, experiment, and discover wonderful&lt;br /&gt;things. There are surprises, fantasies and lots of fulfilled expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Julian&#39;s Private Scrapbook is meant for mature readers; the purpose is to&lt;br /&gt;look at underlying present day social issues from a new perspective: the&lt;br /&gt;past, and the positive. Barr&#39;s Meadow is the first in a five novel series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for sale to persons under 18.&lt;/p&gt;" />
