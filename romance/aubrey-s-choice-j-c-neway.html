  <title>Aubrey’S Choice - J.C. Neway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Aubrey walks down the aisle to marry the man of her dreams, she already knows the marriage will not last. Ian, her husband-to-be, is slowly dying from cancer. As Aubrey reflects on what once was and what will never be, she mentally returns to a time when she and her two best friends, Jack and Ian, were three teenage musketeers with not a care in the world. But after Jack and Ian force Aubrey to choose between them, a betrayed Jack suddenly moves away, changing their dynamic forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after Ian passes away, twenty-five-year-old Aubrey knows she needs to escape her small town, her grief, and all those who pity her. Her travels lead her to Texas, where she is soon pulled over by a police officerwho immediately recognizes her. Jack knows he is still in love with Aubrey, but his anger over her rejection of him overwhelms any good feelings. As the two part with not a kind word between them, Jack has no idea that he is about to run into Aubrey again. It seems that destiny has taken over his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this contemporary romance novel, Jack must reconcile with his past and learn to forgive othersand himselfbefore he can ever love again. &lt;/p&gt;" />
