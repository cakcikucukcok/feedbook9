  <title>Seduced By The Enemy (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Jamie Denton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Rogue FBI agent Jared Romine is determined to prove his innocence. Accused of a double murder he didn&#39;t commit, Jared knows he&#39;s simply a pawn in a larger conspiracy. The only way to clear his name, though, is with some help. And sexy lawyer Peyton Douglas is the one he needs…and wants.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Peyton doesn&#39;t know what to think. Jared insists he&#39;s being framed. But she&#39;s sure he did it. Not only did she see the evidence, she&#39;s the one who turned him in…. He claims she&#39;s in danger, and wants to protect her. Now on the run, she isn&#39;t sure she can maintain her self-control. Jared&#39;s hot kisses and sensual touch ignite something within Peyton she&#39;d forgotten existed…a burning desire that won&#39;t end with just one night.&lt;/p&gt;
