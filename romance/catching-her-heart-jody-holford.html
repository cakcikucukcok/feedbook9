  <title>Catching Her Heart - Jody Holford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a beautiful brunette driver meets Nashville Slammers catcher, Sawyer McBain, at the airport, he figures it&#39;s his lucky day. Sure, he&#39;s usually pretty guarded around people, especially after what happened with his ex, but he can definitely enjoy the car ride. Until she passes his apartment...and keeps driving. All of a sudden the woman seems a lot less like romance material and a lot more like a &lt;i&gt;kidnapper&lt;/i&gt;. What gives?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slammers executive Addison Carlisle needs one little favor. Sure, she may have kinda maybe kidnapped one of her professional baseball players, but it&#39;s for a &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; good cause. She desperately needs someone high-profile to auction off that night for the multiple sclerosis society she&#39;s chairing, but he insists he wants a favor in return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Addie and Sawyer are trading completely ridiculous I.O.U.s, like being his plus-one to his grandmother&#39;s poker game or keeping each other company at the driving range. But when their agreement goes from flirty to fiery, neither is ready to let their guard down for a shot at love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the For Love of the Game series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Covering All the Bases&lt;br&gt;* Catching Her Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
