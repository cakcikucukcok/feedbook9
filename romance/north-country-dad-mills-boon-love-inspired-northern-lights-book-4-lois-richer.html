        &lt;p&gt;The Mommy Plan&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Widower Grant Adams loves his twin stepdaughters, but what does he know about pigtails and dresses and being a full-time dad? With his new job in a remote Canadian center for troubled boys, Grant needs a good nanny. But when he meets Dahlia Wheatley, who&#39;s loving, patient and kind to his girls, he realizes the twins need more than a sitter–they need a mother. With her own harrowing past, Dahlia is as reluctant to get emotionally involved as Grant is. Yet his startling proposition just may form a happy new family of four.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Northern Lights:&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the edge of the Arctic, love awaits&lt;/p&gt;
