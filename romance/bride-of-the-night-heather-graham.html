  <title>Bride of the Night - Heather Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&amp;#39;s the vampire that could destroy a nation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, that&amp;#39;s what Pinkerton detective Finn Dunne thinks of Tara Fox. Capturing her aboard a ship sneaking its way northward, he&amp;#39;s convinced she&amp;#39;s been sent to take out President Lincoln. While she&amp;#39;s certainly the most attractive assassin he&amp;#39;s ever faced, that won&amp;#39;t keep him from his duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tara has always been caught between worlds. As a vampire born and raised in Key West, she has many friends among the humans. Many friends that are now fighting and dying in the raging Civil War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her strange dreams began, she thought of them as abstract visions. But she now knows that she must travel to Washington, D.C., and protect the president at all costs. Finn still won&amp;#39;t trust her, despite what he&amp;#39;s seen. And if Tara has to go through him&amp;#151;or bring reinforcements&amp;#151;to save Lincoln, she will do whatever it takes, even if it costs her her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
