        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster captivated readers with her stories of love, justice and danger in the Men Who Walk the Edge of Honor series. Now, fan-favorite Chris Chapey gets his own story!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the going gets tough, the tough turn to Chris Chapey. As the right-hand man to a group of take-no-prisoners mercenaries, Chris can organize a top-secret rescue mission with his eyes closed. But when it comes to his personal life, Chris is the one who needs a little help. His problem: Matt Houser.&lt;/p&gt;
