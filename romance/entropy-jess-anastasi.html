  <title>Entropy - Jess Anastasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Captain Qaelan Forster is used to trouble. He lives on the wrong side of the law and he&#39;s on the most-wanted lists. He&#39;s mixed up in his cousin&#39;s mess who has problems on a cosmic level--like shape-shifting aliens who want them dead. But Qaelan&#39;s not prepared for the cheeky kind of trouble called Camille Blackstone, whose infamous father has any man interested in his daughter executed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Camille drags Qaelan into an impulsive act of rebellion, she finds herself trying to defend the sexy captain from her overprotective father&#39;s wrath, even if she has to handcuff herself to the sexy captain to keep him alive. However, it soon becomes apparent there are much more dangerous things lurking in the dark corners of the universe than a vengeful pirate lord. And she&#39;s just landed in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atrophy series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Atrophy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Quantum&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Diffraction&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Entropy&lt;/p&gt;" />
