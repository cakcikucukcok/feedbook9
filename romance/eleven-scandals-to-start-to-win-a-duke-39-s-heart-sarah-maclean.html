  <title>Eleven Scandals to Start to Win a Duke&#39;s Heart - Sarah MacLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She lives for passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bold, impulsive, and a magnet for trouble, Juliana Fiori is no simpering English miss. She refuses to play by society&#39;s rules: she speaks her mind, cares nothing for the approval of the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt;, and can throw a punch with remarkable accuracy. Her scandalous nature makes her a favorite subject of London&#39;s most practiced gossips . . . and precisely the kind of woman The Duke of Leighton wants far far away from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He swears by reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scandal is the last thing Simon Pearson has room for in his well-ordered world. The Duke of Disdain is too focused on keeping his title untainted and his secrets unknown. But when he discovers Juliana hiding in his carriage late one evening&amp;#8212;risking everything he holds dear&amp;#8212;he swears to teach the reckless beauty a lesson in propriety. She has other plans, however; she wants two weeks to prove that even an unflappable duke is not above passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
