  <title>Dirty-Talking Cowboy - Stacey Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From author Stacey Kennedy comes &lt;i&gt;Dirty-Talking Cowboy,&lt;/i&gt; the first book in the Kinky Spurs series&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Monroe has returned to River Rock, Colorado, after the death of her grandmother. Now she&#39;s inherited a farm full of abused animals and she&#39;s working as a waitress at the local hotspot, Kinky Spurs. The last thing Emma wants in her life is a man, as she&#39;s still recovering from a recent heartbreak. But when a sensual and powerful cowboy, Shep Blackshaw enters her life, Emma begins to want things she shouldn&#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shep knows sex shouldn&#39;t be on his mind. He&#39;s got a world of responsibility on his shoulders. He&#39;s attempting to save his late father&#39;s cattle ranch, Blackshaw Cattle Company, from foreclosure. But Emma&#39;s heated reactions to his  touch make ignoring her impossible. She&#39;s the perfect distraction to make him forget that his father&#39;s company is a sinking ship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their nights only heat up, soon emotions become tangled into the mix. Shep&#39;s not only giving Emma the hottest nights of her life, he&#39;s also healing her heart. With every encounter, she forgets her heartbreak. With every naughty adventure, she stops mourning the life she left behind. And with every dirty word whispered from Shep&#39;s mouth, she stops thinking of all the reasons why she shouldn&#39;t fall for him. But when the past comes to claim Emma, she&#39;ll need to choose between the life she thought she wanted and the life she&#39;s grown to love with Shep. How will she say no to forever with a dirty-talking cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
