  <title>On Baker Street - Julia Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jackie and her husband, Travis, are living the American dream. With a nice three-bedroom home in the suburbs, a swimming pool, and two beautiful sons, their family life is just about perfect. Then the unthinkable happens. Travis is killed in a tragic accident, and soon Jackie can no longer afford the suburban lifestyle.
With her two boys, Jackie moves to Baker Street in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though its located in the Hamptons, a low-income housing area, Jackie is determined to raise her boys with all the advantages she can give them. She soon finds, however, that things work a little differently on this side of town. Gangs, drugs, and violence become routine in their lives, and Jackie tries desperately to find a way out.
Jackie is not alone, either. Other families want out, too, but financial hardships and disabilities keep them where they are. With her husband gone and her spirit crying for peace, Jackie becomes a one-woman army, determined to stand up to the thugs and criminals who want to ruin the neighborhood and everyone in it. 
Such bravery doesnt come without a price, though, as Jackie is about to find out." />
