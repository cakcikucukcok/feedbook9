  <title>Another Man&#39;s Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Desire) - Judith McWilliams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;HOW FAR WOULD SHE GO… ?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The mission: Ginny Alton had agreed to impersonate her cousin and travel halfway around the world with a newborn in order to have the child meet his paternal grandfather. The complication: Everyone believed she was the child&#39;s mother! The man: Philip Lysander knew Ginny was lying about something, so in order to protect his family, he told everyone he was the baby&#39;s father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ginny suddenly found herself hopelessly attracted to the one man who could destroy her carefully constructed charade. But how could she deny herself the intensity of Philip&#39;s lovemaking when their time together was so short? Especially when he was about to discover the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
