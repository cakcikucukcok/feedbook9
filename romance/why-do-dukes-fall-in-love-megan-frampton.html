  <title>Why Do Dukes Fall in Love? - Megan Frampton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Megan Frampton&amp;#8217;s captivating new Dukes Behaving Badly novel, we learn the answer to the question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do dukes fall in love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael, the Duke of Hadlow, has the liberty of enjoying an indiscretion . . . or several. But when it comes time for him to take a proper bride, he ultimately realizes he wants only one woman: Edwina Cheltam. He&amp;#8217;d hired her as his secretary, only to quickly discover she was sensuous and intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They embark on a passionate affair, and when she breaks it off, he accepts her decision as the logical one . . . but only at first. Then he decides to pursue her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael is brilliant, single-minded, and utterly indifferent to being the talk of the ton. It&amp;#8217;s even said his only true friend is his dog. Edwina had begged him to marry someone appropriate&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;someone aristocratic . . . someone high-born . . . someone else. But the only thing more persuasive than a duke intent on seduction is one who has fallen irrevocably in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
