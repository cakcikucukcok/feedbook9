  <title>Always in Her Heart - Marta Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the eight years since their romance had ended in confusion, Link Morgan and Annie Gideon had barely spoken. But when tragedy left twenty-month-old Marcy, Link’s goddaughter and Annie’s niece, parentless, the two stepped in to protect her—by getting married.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;The plan was for Annie to care for the baby, and Link—never the family man—to handle the finances. That part was easy. But Link’s growing feelings for Annie were proving difficult.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As he saw Annie’s tough exterior weaken, Link was discovering the beautiful, vulnerable woman he’d known underneath, and he wondered how he’d ever let her go. But he also wondered how a man who’d never known a happy home would ever be able to create one.…" />
