      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Anne Sheridan would never have missed her best friend&#39;s wedding. It was the flowers she couldn&#39;t handle. And after taking one too many antihistamines, the allergy-ridden bridesmaid found herself being carried off by dashing groomsman Sheik Rafik Harun. Imagine her surprise when she woke up in the notorious bachelor&#39;s bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Honor kept Rafik from taking advantage of the drowsy beauty in his care. But now desperation had him making an even bolder request–that she pose as his fiancée! Only until he convinced his marriage-minded parents that he was better off a bachelor. Or until the pretty Miss Sheridan found her way into his hard heart…&lt;/p&gt;
