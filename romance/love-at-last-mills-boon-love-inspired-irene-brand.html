          &lt;strong&gt;LOVE FOUND&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had been her first and only love. Yet when Lorene Harvey met Perry Saunders again after twenty years, she was amazed by the emotions sweeping through her. She wanted desperately for them to have a second chance, but Lorene had a secret…one she feared Perry would never forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was the love of his life. Or so Perry had thought in college. And when Lorene had suddenly disappeared, he had vowed to never love again. Now he knew his feelings had never died. But would he ever convince her that his forgiveness and love were hers for the asking?&lt;/p&gt;
