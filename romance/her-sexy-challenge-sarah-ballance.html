  <title>Her Sexy Challenge - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Tyler doesn&#39;t do bridges--she just doesn&#39;t know it until she lands her dream job and freezes halfway across her new town&#39;s towering death span. Cue the cocky, infuriating fireman who goads her off the bridge. He&#39;s hot, but he&#39;s also exactly the kind of guy she wants to avoid...which she manages to do for a whole four hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lt. Shane Hendricks is only two weeks away from leaving Dry Rock. He sure as hell doesn&#39;t need to get involved with a woman he has to rescue twice in one day. The fact that she&#39;s clearly annoyed by him doesn&#39;t deter him from throwing down a challenge--one that proves hard to resist for all the wrong reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&#39;re moving in different directions. Leaving should be easy, but falling for Caitlin might be the one fire he can&#39;t put out...&lt;/p&gt;" />
