      <meta name="description" content="At the Manor House, Victoria is attempting to see Michael, through the first weeks after the death of his wife, Michael is waiting in anticipation for news of his son, and they take delivery of something which neither is expecting. Victoria has a sealed letter, which may have profound effect upon the future of her family, and she must decide whether or not to give the letter to its intended recipient. In the village, Isabella is planning her revenge against those who have so abused her, meanwhile a chance visit by Reginald to Jacobs Field sets him on course to see his domestic circumstances back on track, and unbeknownst to him he will meet somebody who will have a far more profound effect upon his life. Megan, the black witch, gains the confidence of those around her as she continues to quietly hatch her murderous plans, and Percival returns from his self - imposed exile, and must decide whether or not he will stay in the village. However, as with much in Percivals life, nothing on his return will be as he would have expected. Tarragon records her second album, and the band plays on, but will she be invited to join them on their world tour?" />
