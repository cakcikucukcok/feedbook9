  <title>So Twisted - Melissa Marino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I was totally blown away!&quot; -- Tara Sue Me, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Submissive series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Sometimes it feels good to be a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; little bad&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;  Callie has found the perfect job. As nanny for a single dad and his adorable daughter, she can pay off her student loans and live in a nice house in the heart of Chicago. There&#39;s just one problem-her new boss. Definitely no dad bod here. Just six-plus feet of raw, sexual energy. Whoever heard of a dad being so hot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  From the sparkle in his daughter&#39;s eyes, Aaron can see that hiring Callie was a good decision. But Callie&#39;s breathtaking smile and long legs have him thinking about his own needs. Aaron knows it&#39;s a bad idea to get involved with the nanny, but it&#39;s been years since anyone has captivated him like Callie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When living under the same roof proves too tempting to resist, Callie and Aaron discover a mind-blowing passion unlike anything either has experienced. But with a curious child and a nosy family in the mix, their secret, no-strings fling soon turns into a twisted, tangled knot . . ." />
