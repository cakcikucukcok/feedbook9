  <title>The SEALS - Anne Calhoun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three scorching Alpha Ops novellas, together for the first time in Anne Calhoun&#39;s ebundle The SEALS!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The SEAL&#39;s Second Chance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In high school, basketball star Charlotte Stannard and Navy SEAL Jamie Hawthorn were everything  but lovers. They shared a ruthlessly competitive spirit and relentless drive, but Charlie, afraid of the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy at seventeen, drove Jamie away. But now Jamie&#39;s back in town for the  banquet to honor the basketball coach, and finds Charlie, newly home  from a successful career in the European leagues and coaching the girls&#39; team. The flames between them are hotter than ever, but Charlie  believes Jamie just wants what he couldn&#39;t have when they were kids. Jamie&#39;s not just playing to win. He&#39;s playing for Charlie&#39;s heart,  forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SEAL&#39;s Rebel Librarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Powell never planned on leaving the Navy, but his final mission as a SEAL left him with a  tremor and a bad case of nerves. He&#39;s home, taking some college classes and trying to figure out what comes next when he meets Erin Kent, a divorced college librarian with an adventurous bucket list and a mission  to get her ex-husband&#39;s voice out of her head. Jack guides Erin through skydiving and buying the motorcycle of her dreams, blithely accepting Erin&#39;s promise that their relationship is purely temporary. But when  Jack gets the chance to go back into the shadowy world of security contracting, can he convince Erin to break her word and join him on the adventure of a lifetime?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SEAL&#39;s Secret Lover&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logistics director Rose Powell agreed to chaperone her grandmother on a guided tour of Roman ruins on one condition: her brother Jack would come with her. But when Jack backs out, his best friend and fellow SEAL Keenan Parker takes his place. Without a working cell phone, Rose&#39;s orderly world drifts into dreamy days and hot, secret nights in Keenan&#39;s bed. Keenan left the Navy but never made it any farther than Istanbul, much less to a viable future. Until he does, he&#39;ll show Rose things she didn&#39;t know about herself. Can he give his heart and his future to the woman he promised his best friend he&#39;d never touch?&lt;/p&gt;" />
