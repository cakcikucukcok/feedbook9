  <title>Covert Loves - William Bowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ken Fisher joined the army after World War II ended. He had always wanted to travel and see the world; however, post-war Germany is nothing like what he expected it to be. Instead of beholding beautiful landscapes and thankful citizens, Ken finds gritty despair and racism in a country still greatly in need of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
Amid the chaos, Ken inexplicably falls in love with a charming German girl named Elona. But love isnt simple after war, especially because Ken is an outsider. When Elona and Ken decide to get married, their application for a marriage license reveals dark, terrible secrets, bringing their love deeply into question.&lt;/p&gt;
Eventually, Ken leaves Germany and love behind and becomes a Green Beret. He serves several tours and gains knowledge of unconventional warfare in South Vietnam, where he learns to be a true soldier. At this point, Kens military career could have ended. He could have continued teaching ROTC kids and living a peaceable, happy existence. Instead, he is sent to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, where he is given a final assignment that will test his beliefs and his promise to serve and protect. When faced with this assignment, Ken must make a life-changing choice between accepting army orders and maintaining country and upholding his own beliefs in right and wrong." />
