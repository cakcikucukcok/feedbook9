Then she got out of a terrible relationship. Now an injury is threatening to end her dance career for good. It&amp;#39;s time for plan B: college. And maybe she&amp;#39;ll have a chance to convince Jase that what they have together is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jase Winstead has a huge secret that he&amp;#39;s not telling anyone&amp;#8212;especially not his best friend&amp;#39;s incredibly beautiful sister. Even though he and Teresa shared the hottest kiss of his life, he knows that his responsibilities must take priority. He certainly doesn&amp;#39;t have time for a relationship. But it doesn&amp;#39;t help that all he can think about is kissing the one girl who could ruin everything for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they&amp;#39;re thrown together more and more, Jase and Teresa can&amp;#39;t keep denying their feelings for each other. But a familiar danger looms and tragedy strikes. As the campus recovers, the star-crossed couple must decide what they&amp;#39;re willing to risk to be together and what they&amp;#39;re willing to lose if they&amp;#39;re not. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
