  <title>Endure the Night - Cynthia Crowner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eve Marie Steele discovered the hard way that her marriage was in trouble-the other woman told her. On the most important night of her career, Eve learned her husband had been unfaithful, shattering her entire life into a million pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peregrine Steele insisted that Eve&#39;s job as a Christian counselor had left him vulnerable, but a careless mistake couldn&#39;t destroy their marriage. He wanted his wife, he wanted his marriage and he was determined to fight for both. He convinced Eve to stand by him in his fight against a lawsuit as well. Perry was charged with sexual harassment. He vowed the woman had been the pursuer-which proved to be true when the woman began stalking Eve and Perry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eve retreated to their home in St. Michaels, Maryland. The lovely old Victorian house was a haven-until the house was burglarized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, finally, through the sleuthing skills of Eve&#39;s bible study class, a few body guards tossed in here and there, and the local law, Eve and Perry managed to endure the night. They discovered how much God loved them, and found joy in their love for each other-and their new baby. &lt;/p&gt;" />
