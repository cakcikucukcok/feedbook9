  <title>Passionate Relationship (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shelly had found the family she had never known, and an impossibly attractive man - all in the irresistible form of Jaime des Hilvares. But Jaime was her stepbrother.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was also convinced that she was a gold digger, after her share of the family inheritance. So why then, was he asking Shelly to marry him? He said he was in love with her, he showed his feelings for her every time he looked at her, touched her…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet perhaps this seduction was part of a far more sinister plan - revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
