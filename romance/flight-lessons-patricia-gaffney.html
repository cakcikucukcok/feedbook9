  <title>Flight Lessons - Patricia Gaffney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anna has studiously avoided her Aunt Rose&amp;#8212;the woman she once loved more than anyone else in the world&amp;#8212;ever since the night Rose betrayed Anna and her mother, Rose&#39;s own fatally ill sister. In the sixteen years that have passed, Anna has built another life for herself far from her hometown on Maryland&#39;s eastern shore, but she can&#39;t forgive or forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now another betrayal, by a faithless lover, has brought Anna back to her family&#39;s restaurant, where Rose needs her estranged niece&#39;s help&amp;#8212;and trust&amp;#8212;more than ever before. Determined to leave as soon as the struggling business is back on its feet and her own hurt is healed, Anna joins Rose in the kitchen of the Bella Sorella, resolved to remain unaffected by Rose&#39;s longing to undo the past. But Anna&#39;s resistance could blind her to a true and unexpected love that&#39;s reaching out to grab her by the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author patricia gaffney&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Flight Lessons&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant, funny, and wise story of truth, loyalty, and the bonds that shape, sustain, and ultimately uplift us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
