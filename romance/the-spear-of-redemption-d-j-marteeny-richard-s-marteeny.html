  <title>The Spear of Redemption - D. J. Marteeny, Richard S. Marteeny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Avenger has captured and imprisoned the evil vampire Dragone. Mysterious and secretive, the Avenger has become the trusted ally of the vampire Julian Reynolds; together they must wage war against Dragones evil hordes. Along with Adrianna Avani, the woman he loves, and a handful of others, Julian must find the one weapon that can destroy Dragonethe spear of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian and his band of warriors must travel the world, from the ancient ruins and hidden treasures of Rome to the sacred sights of Jerusalem, to find the weapon before it falls into the wrong hands, risking both the safety of the world and Julians one chance for redemption from the sins of a life that was forced upon him centuries ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nightmarish creatures arent the only demons Julian must battle as he fights to control his loveor lustfor Adrianna. Her blood carries the gene capable of making him human once again; but, in Julians world, humanity means weakness, something he cannot afford in his fight against Dragone. Should he forfeit his vampiric powers and accept the gift hes waited for all of these centuries? Or does he give up his dream, resisting Adrianna long enough to destroy Dragone once and for all! &lt;/p&gt;" />
