          &lt;em&gt;Their dislike of each other turned into attraction…which turned into love&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassie McClean, a builder of luxury homes, and Jake Coffey, a breeder of fine Andalusian horses, have neighboring businesses. While they&#39;ve had several differences of opinion about how their businesses are affecting each other, their mutual attraction forces them to work out their problems–and discover their love for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All Cassie and Jake want to do is concentrate on their busy lives–and their new relationship. But when a dangerous arsonist starts destroying property on both sides of their fence, Cassie and Jake find they have new problems–problems that are costing them time and money, but are also endangering lives, particularly Cassie&#39;s. She and Jake set out to find the connection between the threats being made to Cassie now and the heartbreaking childhood illness she almost didn&#39;t survive. Will they discover it in time?&lt;/p&gt;
