  <title>Trouble at Lone Spur (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Roz Denny Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Settle down for a warm, wonderful read by the talented Roz Denny Fox!&quot;–Kristin Hannah&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Lone Spur Ranch&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Crockett County, Texas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lizbeth Robbins has been following the rodeo circuit for the past six years, learning the farrier&#39;s trade, dragging her little girl from town to town. But now her daughter&#39;s in school and Lizbeth needs a more permanent job. She&#39;s relieved to find one at the Lone Spur: shoeing Gil Spencer&#39;s quarter horses. Even if it was his foreman who hired her and the man himself doesn&#39;t want her anywhere near his ranch!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gil Spencer hates rodeos–mainly because his ex-wife loves them. While he was busy pulling his ranch out of the red, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was busy pursuing a career as a champion barrel-racer. Worse yet, the ex-Mrs. Spencer abandoned her husband &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their twin sons for the dubious charms of some bronc rider. So the last person Gil wants on the Lone Spur is a former rodeo employee. Even if Lizbeth Robbins is the most attractive woman he&#39;s met in years. &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; then…&lt;/p&gt;
