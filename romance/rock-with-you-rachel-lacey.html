      <meta name="description" content="SWEET AS SUGAR. SEXY AS SIN . . . &lt;br&gt;  Carly Taylor is pretty sure she&#39;s dreaming. It&#39;s not possible that Sam Weiss - rock star god and sexy hotness personified - is actually in her bakery. This sort of thing never happens in the too-small town of Haven. Or to her. And being stranded in a secluded mountain cabin with the deliciously decadent Sam during an ice storm? This is definitely not Carly&#39;s real life . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now there&#39;s just the two of them, a roaring fire, lots of food and drink, and a sizzling attraction - one that just might make Carly do the unexpected. For one night, she&#39;ll live the fantasy. For one night, nothing else matters. . . not her struggling business, not her lonely life, not Sam&#39;s bad-boy reputation. But sometimes one night can turn one crazy, beautiful dream into something real." />
