  <title>Brooklyn Heights - Trevon Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brooke is deep undercover and she&amp;#39;s been promoted to manage a more prestigious gang territory, Brooklyn Heights. &amp;nbsp;She hasn&amp;#39;t heard from her own squadron in a while, and she&amp;#39;s got quite a lot to tell them. &amp;nbsp;Her instincts tell her that something is wrong but she knows she has to ignore them if she wants to survive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lamar and Marcus aren&amp;#39;t like the usual run of the mill gangsters she&amp;#39;s used to. &amp;nbsp;As she becomes more engrossed in their lives, she begins to wonder if they&amp;#39;re getting outside help. &amp;nbsp;They&amp;#39;ve split their empire into multiple gangs, with no true center that she can pinpoint. &amp;nbsp;In addition, they&amp;#39;ve built several businesses of their own to launder their money.&lt;br /&gt;
Brooke can&amp;#39;t help but think that there&amp;#39;s another higher power at work with the isolation they&amp;#39;ve created. &amp;nbsp;Unbeknownst to her, Captain Bolt and the team supporting her are also finding strange activity within the police ranks in Brooklyn. &amp;nbsp;Does Brooke manage to use her newfound position at Brooklyn Heights to uncover more of Lamar and Marcus&amp;#39; thuggish empire, or is she headed for a trap created by the very police she works for?" />
