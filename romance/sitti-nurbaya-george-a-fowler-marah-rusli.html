  <title>Sitti Nurbaya - George A Fowler, Marah Rusli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author’s thoughts are reflected through this love story of forbidden lovers, telling a story about customs that were no longer in line with the times, and desire for release from the shackles of traditional societies that did not provide an opportunity for the young to express their opinions or desires. Sitti Nurbaya (Siti Nurbaya) laid the foundation of thinking that led to the emancipation of women, to make women think more about their rights, about whether to give up because of the society’s demand (and parents’ pressure) or pursue her own interests. The story is evocative and left a lasting impression, and as a result, the romance that was written in 1922 is still an icon on the tradition of coercion, especially arranged marriage, which ends tragically." />
