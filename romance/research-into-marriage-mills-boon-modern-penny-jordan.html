  <title>Research Into Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She never thought love would spoil her marriage. Harassed by her brother-in-law&#39;s loathsome advances, Jessica decided that the only solution was marriage. And the easiest way to find a husband was to advertise in the newspaper! Besides, she reasoned, the experience could prove the thesis of her book: that romantic love was not the best foundation for marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lyle Garnett, a busy English doctor needing a mother for his two troublesome sons, answered Jessica&#39;s ad. He seemed equally determined to keep their relationship strictly practical.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But, to her dismay, Jessica fell in love with the irascible doctor and her theory began to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;
