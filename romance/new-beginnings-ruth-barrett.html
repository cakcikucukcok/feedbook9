  <title>New Beginnings - Ruth Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years, Susan Bennett has enjoyed a rosy life. She married Jerry, her high school sweetheart, loved her job, and looked forward to a future full of dreams and promises of wonderful things to come. But then it all came crashing to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;
The police show up on her doorstep one day and tell her that Jerry, the man she thought she knew and loved, had been arrested on charges of robbery and murder. Worse, Susans life could very well be in danger. Her only option was to obtain a divorce, change her name, and move to another part of the country. Her only contact with her previous life was the detective in charge of the case against her now former husband. &lt;br /&gt;
Now, as Susan Grant, she moves to a town called Hopewell where she can start anew. Soon, she secures a place to live and a good job. She even makes friends with Tim, the handsome local minister. Just as she begins to envision a future free from fear, however, the events of her past intrude to threaten her newfound happiness." />
