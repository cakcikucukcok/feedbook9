  <title>The Swan and the Seal - Kristi Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first novella in this series was a &#39;getting together&#39; story. In this sequel, we switch from Reggie&#39;s to Kelp&#39;s point of view, and see the couple after a rocky reuniting and how Kelp struggles to regain Reggie&#39;s trust. The Irish countryside and in particular, the Dowth burial mound at Newgrange, plays a major role in the plot. Reggie accepts an archaeological studies contract there and Kelp goes with him, but soon finds himself bored- and mute, after an unexpected encounter with a cromwight, or burial specter.  The second half of the story shows how they deal with Kelp&#39;s muteness in different ways. We meet Reggie&#39;s distinctive mother, as well as two magus women from Kelp&#39;s past who demand that he help them because he owes them for something. At the end they&#39;ve been invited to England by Reggie&#39;s mother and Kelp wants to go, but feels an irrational trepidation." />
