      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When it comes to competitive cooking, Max Lunden is no stranger to winning...though he&#39;s never been great at working with a team. A master chef-and major hunk-he&#39;s traveled the world, picking up new cooking techniques as well as beautiful women. But when the prodigal chef returns home to his family&#39;s Greenwich Village restaurant, he discovers one too many cooks in the kitchen-and she&#39;s every bit as passionate as he is...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juliet Cavanaugh used to have a crush on Max when she was just a teenager, hanging out at Lunden &amp; Sons Tavern, hoping to catch a glimpse of the owner&#39;s oldest, and hottest, son. Now a chef herself-competing in the biggest culinary contest in the country-Juliet will be cooking side by side with the one man she&#39;s always admired...and desired. But despite their simmering attraction, Juliet is determined to keep her cool-no matter how hot it gets...&lt;/p&gt;" />
