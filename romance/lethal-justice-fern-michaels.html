      <meta name="description" content="The women of the Sisterhood are fun, smart, sassy, and determined to get their way every time. But most of all, they are the best friends a woman wants by her side in good times and bad. Meeting once again in Myra Rutledge&#39;s beautiful Virginia home, they&#39;re ready to face a new challenge and right a vicious wrong.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexis Thorn, once a successful securities broker, spent a hellish year behind bars for a crime she never committed. Now she has her freedom, but she&#39;s left with haunting memories of being hauled from her office in handcuffs.  .  .of the cell door clanging shut behind her.  .  .of her pleas going unheard. Meanwhile the real criminals--her former employers, Roland Sullivan and his lover Arden Gillespie--continue to make millions by conning the innocent, especially preying on the elderly and taking their life savings. Alexis dreams of getting even. The legal system failed her, but the Sisterhood won&#39;t. They have a delicious plan that can give Sullivan and Gillespie a taste of their own bitter medicine.  .  ." />
