  <title>Drop In! Drop Out? - Earle Perkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;When beautiful Karen Hittman shows up for an interview, Ned Marvin doesn&#39;t know what to make of her. Karen is a journalist but is willing to put her writing career on hold for the chance to take a job Ned is offering...spending thirty days isolated on the Caribbean island of Pogo restoring an abandoned, tiny fuel station for the navy, It seems that Karen purports to be a skilled mechanical whiz and is strong enough to handle the physical aspects of the project. Ned is convinced to hire her...and it doesn&#39;t hurt that she is the most attractive girl he has ever seen. The newly formed team soon find themselves on a lovely island paradise only to find that they are not alone. The island has been hiding a band of German POW&#39;s and their offsprings, who are not aware that WW2 has been over for twenty-five years. Just when things are looking romantic for Ned, the two are kidnapped by the Germans and they must use all their wiles to survive. This is only one of their many adventures in this high spirited romp that has the pace of an old fashioned matinee.&quot;" />
