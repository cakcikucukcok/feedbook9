  <title>Missionary - Enrique Cruz, Ian Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dreams can come true, even when all hope for happiness has vanished. &lt;b&gt;Fernando and Brig&lt;/b&gt;, virtual orphans who faced harsh realities as they grew into men. One was a street thug, sent into exile by his mother, while the other was disowned for being gay. Many would falter under these circumstances, but they chose to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fernando&lt;/b&gt;- This handsome and wealthy older businessman grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, but through an iron will and determination to succeed, his business becomes the envy of his peers. When agonizing loneliness and tragedy strike, he&amp;rsquo;s forced to decide between following the same isolated path, or taking a chance on love with his handsome, yet vulnerable employee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Brig&lt;/b&gt;- a loner tossed out by his conservative, religious family for his sexuality. Introspective, unable to see what he has to offer another man, his love of books almost fills the void in his heart. Content to live alone, afraid of being hurt, his attraction for his older boss becomes unbearable. Forced to make a decision about his future, will he find the happiness his heart desires with his wealthy, yet humble employer?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making hard choices is second nature to these survivors, but now they must make the hardest choice of all- to overcome their fears, and open their hearts to one another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a stand alone May/December romance with a HEA, no cliffhangers, and lots of feels." />
