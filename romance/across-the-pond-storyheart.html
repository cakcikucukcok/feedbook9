  <title>Across the Pond - Storyheart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;When almost fifteen-year-old, English born Fred Squires parents win a trip to Australia, Fred finds himself packed off to visit family friends in the United States. Even worse, hes given a boring language project to complete.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But then he meets Brittany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fred soon finds himself struggling, not only with his growing feelings for Brit, but also with the language differences. A state confusion, that increases when he meets Brits flirtatious friend, Angel.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Escaping from a confrontation with Steve Harris, the neighborhood bully, Brit tells Fred her dark secret about Harris, and Freds world is turned upside down.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Life continues to throw Fred a curveball when he catches a ball worth thousands of dollars at a baseball game. Further angry run-ins with Harris, a crazy family BBQ, and being chased through a Boston mall all add to the thrill of Freds American adventure.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A final fight between Fred and Harris, leads Brit to at last reveal her painful secret to her parents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Brit and her Brit&quot;, know that their young love will be followed by heartache when Fred has to return back &quot;Across the Pond&quot; to England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, not before some final twists in the tale." />
