  <title>Gambling on the Bodyguard - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ski instructor Ellie Montgomery hits Vegas during a romance convention to meet the man of her dreams...only, the man of her dreams isn&#39;t the cover model she&#39;s there to see. He&#39;s the hot-as-sin bodyguard who catches her sneaking in the back door of a meet-and-greet, and he seems more than ready to do what it takes to prove he&#39;s twice the man her pretty boy crush could ever be.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jax Mathis couldn&#39;t resist snagging a date with Ellie, but he didn&#39;t count on the attraction being more than physical. They connect on a level he didn&#39;t think possible--and he can&#39;t run fast enough. She makes him want things he thought he&#39;d never have, and maybe, just maybe, they&#39;re within reach. But to have it, he&#39;ll have to face the one mountain he swore he&#39;d never climb...and with no guarantee she&#39;ll be waiting on the other side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The complete &#39;What Happens in Vegas&#39; series (All standalones which can be read out of order) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tempting Her Best Friend by Gina L.
