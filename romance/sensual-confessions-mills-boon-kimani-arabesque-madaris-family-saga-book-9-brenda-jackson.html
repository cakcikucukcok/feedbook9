      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Blade Madaris has watched the men in his family surrender their single status one by one, and he has no plans to join them. But the gorgeous attorney he meets at his cousin&#39;s wedding would make a fine notch on his bedpost.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And when circumstances bring them together for six months, Blade formulates a plan to sweep Samari Di Meglio off her feet and into his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though Blade is the kind of player Sam has spent years avoiding, a no-strings one-night stand is too tempting to resist. But their sizzling night together comes with unforeseen complications. Blade can&#39;t walk away from the most passionate woman he&#39;s ever met. To break through her resistance, the consummate bachelor will have to bare his soul and confess everything that&#39;s in his heart….&lt;/p&gt;
