          &lt;strong&gt;TIES OF PASSION&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The perfect match? Christ Brodey could have any woman he looked at - and he was looking at Tiffany Dean! On a strictly casual basis, though. As far as he was concerned, she was just another gold digger… . Tiffany had no money, no job and no chance of getting either. Her plan to gate-crash the Brodey&#39;s party for a magazine story was her last chance… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The deal: Chris could offer Tiffany his wealth and prestige - and in return she would be anything he wanted. But Tiffany discovered it was one thing to be a kept woman and quite another to be a kept woman in love… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt; Part 1 of Sally Wentworth&#39;s three-part series, Ties of Passion. Money, looks, style - the Brodey family have everything… except love.&lt;/em&gt;
