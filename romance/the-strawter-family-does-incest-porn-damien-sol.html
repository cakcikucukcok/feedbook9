  <title>The Strawter Family Does Incest Porn - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What would you do if you were offered two hundred million dollars? The Strawter family was faced with that very thing. Could this innocent family truly give into the offer to partake of such an incestuous act? Was the money truly worth crossing that fine line? We might never know until we too are asked like the Strawter family was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ben, his wife Christen, and his eighteen-year-old daughter Michelle lounged on the pale tan shores of the Outer Banks one sunny afternoon enjoying the last day of their vacation. Their nineteen-year-old son Martin stayed home attending community college classes that he couldn&amp;#39;t afford to miss. His parents had&amp;nbsp; drained the college fund they had set up for him, due to the crash in the economy and Ben&amp;#39;s poor management skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Martin&amp;rsquo;s parents told him that they couldn&amp;#39;t afford to send him to pre-med school because they had drained his college fund to save their home he blew up. Ben could see the betrayal in his son&amp;#39;s eyes after all the years they had told him it would always be there if he ever chose to attend college.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ben wasn&amp;#39;t a bad looking guy at the age of forty-seven, while he no longer had the muscled toned body of his youth he was still in decent shape. Then there was his wife as she sun bathed on that North Carolina shore. The faint scar from her C-section when she had complications with Michelle&amp;#39;s birth was faintly visible on her forty-five-year-old body. While some of the stretch marks could still be seen Christen took extremely good care of herself. Ben knew how attractive his wife still was given the number of men stopping to look at her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then there was his daughter Michelle a spitting image of her mother at that age. While he wasn&amp;#39;t attracted to his teenage daughter, yet her lithe body and small breasts did turn heads. Little did Ben know his family would be forever changed by that once innocent trip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My, what a handsome family you have there,&amp;rdquo; said an unknown male voice. Ben jumped in his seat as he had thought they had the beach to themselves, at least that&amp;rsquo;s what he had thought when they arrived that morning. Ben peered behind him as the elderly man stood twenty feet behind them. His red smoking jacket reminded Ben of another elderly man that was well known. &amp;ldquo;What brings you out here to this lone beach?&amp;rdquo; he asked his eyes scanning the sunbathing women. Wondering if the man had a son so he could finally have the one video to finish his taboo collection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Umm...we&amp;rsquo;re just here on vacation,&amp;rdquo; Ben said, the wind blowing through his salt and pepper hair as he rose. Something about the man, the way he was eyeing his wife and daughter put him on edge. &amp;ldquo;Who might you be?&amp;rdquo; Ben asked putting himself between the man and his family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ah, where are my manners, Howard Goldburg,&amp;rdquo; he said smiling warmly as he held out his hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Benjamin Strawter,&amp;rdquo; he said shaking the man&amp;#39;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So, mind telling me why you&amp;#39;re on my private island?&amp;rdquo; Ben arched an eyebrow wondering if it was true, or if the man was just trying to scare them off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We weren&amp;#39;t informed that this island was owned by anyone,&amp;rdquo; Christen said propping herself up on her elbows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, this small island has been in my family for years. Few know that it&amp;#39;s privately owned, however, why do you think there are no houses on it?&amp;rdquo; Howard said looking down at her hiding his." />
