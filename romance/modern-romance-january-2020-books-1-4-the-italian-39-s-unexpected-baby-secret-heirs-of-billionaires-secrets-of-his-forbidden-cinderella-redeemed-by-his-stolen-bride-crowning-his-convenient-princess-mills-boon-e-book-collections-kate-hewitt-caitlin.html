          &lt;strong&gt;Four Sizzling Sexy Romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Italian&#39;s Unexpected Baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Hewitt&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire CEO Alessandro is world-renowned for his fierce business discipline. Yet Mia, his new, assistant, threatens that control. And soon their fiery exchanges explode into unrivalled passion! What will happen when Mia shakes his control further by announcing she’s pregnant!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets of His Forbidden Cinderella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin Crews&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Overwhelming. Irresistible. Off-limits. Teo de Luz was all those things to innocent Amelia. Until she attends his opulent masquerade ball, and they share a deliciously anonymous encounter! Now Amelia must tell this brooding Spaniard he’s the father of her unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redeemed by His Stolen Bride &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby Green&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seeking vengeance, billionaire Gabriel isn&#39;t above stealing his rival’s fiancée for himself! His plan seems complete when, to help her penniless family, sweet Leonora agrees to his ruthless proposal. But at his luxury villa, he’s blindsided by their powerful attraction—and her innocence!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowning His Convenient Princess &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maisey Yates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Personal assistant Latika Bakshmi had one job—pick a suitable wife for playboy prince Gunnar. He’s infuriating, arrogant and far too handsome, but when shadows from Latika’s past return, he’s the only man who can save her…if he agrees to her shocking proposition!&lt;/p&gt;
