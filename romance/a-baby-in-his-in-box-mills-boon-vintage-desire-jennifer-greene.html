          &lt;strong&gt;MAN of the Month&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;MR. MARCH &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Urgent Memo from: Powerful CEO Flynn McGannon, expert at seduction. Surprising Subject: That baby delivered to his in-box!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tycoon&#39;s Request: Immediate assistance from prim and proper Molly Weston. Sexy businessman Flynn McGannon prided himself on keeping his cool in every situation. But he had to make an exception for the one that had landed on his desk. What did a carefree bachelor like him know about babies - especially one that was supposed to be his!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His only hope was lovely bookkeeper Molly Weston. But pretty Molly wasn&#39;t exactly feeling generous toward Flynn. Could he help it that he&#39;d been trying to get her into his bed just as he found out he was somebody&#39;s daddy?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MAN OF THE MONTH:&lt;em&gt; This sexy single father was looking for daddy lessons… and found so much more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
