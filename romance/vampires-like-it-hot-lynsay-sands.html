  <title>Vampires Like It Hot - Lynsay Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands brings the heat in this new Argeneau novel, as one woman is rescued by an irresistible immortal &amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Vampires...&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Raffaele Notte pulls a barely dressed, disoriented woman from the ocean, the last thing he expects is for her to utter that word. The immortal has come to the island resort to help his cousin, but now, it seems, there are rogue vampires dining on unsuspecting tourists. And he soon realizes that not only is Jess a target, she&amp;#8217;s also the life mate he&amp;#8217;s been waiting for&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vampires are real. Jess would&amp;#8217;ve never believed it until she saw them with her own eyes. She knows she has to get off the island, and her gallant rescuer has offered to help. There&amp;#8217;s something about Raffaele that&amp;#8217;s unlike any man she has ever met, and his touch sends pleasure through her that is beyond all imagining. But when Jess discovers who he really is, will she risk life as she knows it for a chance of forever by his side?&lt;/p&gt;" />
