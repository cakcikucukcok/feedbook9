She&#39;s here to rescue her kidnapped niece, the only family she&#39;s got left. What she didn&#39;t plan on was walking into a covert ops mission-or being wrapped up in the hard-muscled arms of Rafe Ortega. The cool-as-ice operative&#39;s touch may get her all hot and bothered, but no man can have a hold on her heart until her niece is home where she belongs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Even in the tropics, Alpha Security operative Rafe can take down the bad guys without breaking a sweat. Hostage extractions. Clandestine missions. Those are the things he&#39;s been trained to handle. Relationships? Not so much. But one look at this strong, sexy redhead and he&#39;s seized by a fierce urge to protect her at all costs. Now Penny and Rafe will have to up their game because they&#39;re about to go into a master criminal&#39;s lair without backup, and the danger---and passion---is about to explode . . ." />
