  <title>In His Eyes (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Going Back, Book 38) - Emmie Dark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Hugh Lawson and Zoe Waters have a tangled history. But she left ten years ago and he&#39;s put her behind him. Except she&#39;s here again–just when Hugh&#39;s ready to make an offer for her family&#39;s legendary vineyard. And her version of those long-ago events is enough to make him question everything he thought he knew.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hugh can&#39;t let the past destroy his plans for the future. Which means he has to unravel the truth. But as he does, he begins to realize that he may have been as responsible for what happened as Zoe. And that going back could be the only way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
