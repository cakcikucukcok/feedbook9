          &lt;strong&gt;Paris O&#39;Hara is trying to find herself&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And her hometown of Maple Hill is where she&#39;s starting the search. It turns out her mother lied to her about who her father really is, and Paris needs to know the truth. Until she comes to terms with her past, she can&#39;t allow herself to get involved with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paris tries to keep Randy Sanford at arm&#39;s length, but she can&#39;t resist turning to him when she finally finds what she&#39;s been looking for. As she struggles to accept her newfound knowledge, Paris also has to learn that the past is not nearly as important as the future….&lt;/p&gt;
