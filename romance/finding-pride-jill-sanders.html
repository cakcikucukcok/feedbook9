  <title>Finding Pride - Jill Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Megan Kimble was traveling a long way to find the next chapter in her life, one that would not include her brother, Matt. Losing him now was tragic, even more so since she had finally freed herself from the abuse and the shame of a bad marriage. She had spent years hiding things from Matt, so he wouldn&amp;#39;t know about her horrible life. Keeping her secret world of bruises, cuts, and broken bones, much like the one she now sported with a large white cast. Dealing with her loss was hard, but, now she was thinking of taking over Matt&amp;#39;s new business venture. This could be the fresh start she needed, a new town, a new place to forget the pain and maybe she could learn to trust again. Todd Jordan was a successful businessman, who had once lost it all, and now he had just lost his best friend and business partner. But, then she came into town broken and scared, and for the first time in a long time he was looking forward to his future. Breaking down Megan&amp;#39;s barriers would take patience and strength, and he would need that strength to keep what he loves safe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
