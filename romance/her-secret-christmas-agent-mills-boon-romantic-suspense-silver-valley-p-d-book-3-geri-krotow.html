        &lt;p&gt;Can a former Marine and an undercover cop crack a deadly Christmas case?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a cult threatens the high school where he teaches, ex-Marine Mitch Everlock is on the case. His priority: protecting his students.

        &lt;p&gt;That last thing Nika expected on this investigation was meeting a sexy veteran who makes her heart light up like a Christmas tree. But with both their lives at risk, and the students in danger, neither of them can afford the slightest distraction. Especially one as big as falling in love just as a killer closes in…&lt;/p&gt;
