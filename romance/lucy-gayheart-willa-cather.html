  <title>Lucy Gayheart - Willa Cather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willa Cather&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Gayheart&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;gropes a wistful way back to the time of the horse and buggy, when some men and some women loved deeply and truly and make themselves miserable and hugged their misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small towns, no less than Vienna and the Paris Left Bank and a Greenwich Village as dirty and noisy then as it is now, had romances of which they had a right to be proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it is with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Gayheart&lt;/em&gt;, written in 1935, When she wrote the novel, Cather had just turned 60 and was in tune with the zeitgeist that, shortly, would produce the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. In her homey yet subtle way, she tapped into the modern loss of faith. And she created an existential novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A romance, a feminist story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that way at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Gayheart&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;appears to be nothing more than a confection of a romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy is the bright, lively, musical girl, a stand-out among her young adult peers in the small Nebraska town of Haverford where Harry Gordon, the banker&amp;rsquo;s son, is the most eligible bachelor. They seem made for each other as they skate together on the Platte River in the novel&amp;rsquo;s opening scene. They have always seemed made for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lucy wants a career and has been working in Chicago. She becomes the piano accompanist to a much older classical singer, Clement Sebastian. The two fall in love in a chaste way, just as Harry sweeps into town and, with ham-handed arrogance, tells Lucy that it&amp;rsquo;s about time for them to get married, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the book seems to be on its way to becoming a feminist Horatio Alger story in which the plucky heroine will find her way to beauty (and maybe love) in the stratospheric Olympus of the high arts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
