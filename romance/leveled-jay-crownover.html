      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all need a hero...let the Saints of Denver begin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orlando Frederick knows what it is to be leveled by pain. Instead of focusing on his own, he&amp;#8217;s made it his mission to help others: sports stars, wounded war vets, survivors of all kinds. But when Dom, a rugged, damaged, sinfully attractive cop, makes his way into Lando&amp;#8217;s physical therapy practice, he might be the biggest challenge yet. Lando loved one stubborn man before and barely survived the fallout. He&amp;#8217;s not sure he can do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominic Voss is a protector. The police badge he wears is not only his job, it&amp;#8217;s his identity, so when he&amp;#8217;s sidelined because of an injury, the only thing he cares about is getting back on the force. He expects Lando to mend his body, he just doesn&amp;#8217;t realize the trainer will also have him working toward a hell of a lot more. As attraction simmers and flares, Dom sees that Lando needs repair of his own...if only the man will let him close enough to mend what&amp;#39;s broken.&lt;/p&gt;" />
