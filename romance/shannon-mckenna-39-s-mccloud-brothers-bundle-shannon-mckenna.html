  <title>Shannon McKenna&#39;s McCloud Brothers Bundle - Shannon McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Behind Closed   Doors&lt;p&gt;Seth Mackey knows everything about the women his boss Victor Lazar toys with. But Lazar&#39;s latest plaything, Raine Cameron, is different. Raine is pure temptation, but Seth can&#39;t slip up: he&#39;s convinced Lazar had his half-brother killed and plans to prove it. But then he finds out that Raine may be Lazar&#39;s next victim...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raine has her own reasons to seek revenge on Lazar, and she will, despite the distracting presence of Seth Mackey. He stirs her most erotic fantasies...and inspires her bold plan. Offering her body to him, surrendering to his ruthless desire, might well push her beyond all emotional limits--and beyond fear itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in the   Shadows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connor McCloud can never forget the day he was almost killed by his friend Ed Riggs. It cost Connor what he wants most--Ed&#39;s daughter Erin. He can never have her now, but her beauty still haunts him. When an old enemy resurfaces, Connor is prepared to do anything to protect Erin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin has been harboring secret fantasies about Connor McCloud since she met him--but that was before he sent her father to jail. Now Connor is knocking on her door, telling her she needs his protection. He&#39;s sworn to guard her with his life and his fierce protectiveness awakens long-buried feelings...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of Control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davy McCloud has one rule: never follow blind impulse when it comes to women. But he breaks it the instant Margo Vetter shows up at the gym next door. The sexual hunger--and the instinctual protectiveness--she awakens is much too strong to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broke and on the run, Margot has no one to turn to. But the closer Davy gets, the more Margot discovers that holding back from this enigmatic, powerful man is impossible. In every way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge of Midnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the very day an arsonist burns down Liv Endicott&#39;s bookstore, she finds fate has another shock in store for her. Amid the smoke, rubble, and tears, Sean McCloud appears, calling her name. He&#39;s still the man she kept on wanting. But wanting is not the same as trusting, and she doesn&#39;t dare let him get too close. But a ruthless killer is gunning for Liv, and she&#39;ll die unless they join forces to unearth a chilling truth--and come together in a blaze of searing passion...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme Danger&lt;/p&gt;Nobody&#39;s home when Becca Cantrell takes a midnight skinnydip--and gets hauled out by a guy with burning eyes. The man is the embodiment of her most intense fantasies. And she&#39;s up for risky thrills...&lt;p&gt;Nick Ward can&#39;t tell her that he&#39;s spying on a vicious Russian crime boss. Becca could be an assassin   sent to kill him, a call girl sent to distract him, or the worst scenario of all--a clueless innocent. Anyway he looks at it, she&#39;s trouble: beautiful, bare, dripping-wet trouble...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Weapon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covert operations are what Val Janos is all about. The man is mysterious and sinister, and lethally hot. Only Tamara can understand the strange intensity that drives him to win at all costs--and only she can match it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Val has one weak spot: Imre, the man who befriended him when he was a scared, hungry kid abandoned on the streets of Budapest. But Daddy Novak knows about Imre, and his head is on the block if Val doesn&#39;t deliver Tam up to Novak&#39;s tender mercies...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fade to   Midnight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beaten and tortured, Kev Larsen was found 18 years ago in an alley. He survived the ordeal, but lost all his memories from before that night.  When he nearly dies saving someone from drowning, the surgery to save his life triggers fragments. With only these fractured scenes to guide him, Kev is   determined to unlock the secrets to his past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edie Parrish is good at keeping people away. If the wrong person were to learn of her gift, her life would be in jeopardized. But when Kev discovers who she really is, Edie&#39;s only choice is to trust him. And soon, Edie can&#39;t resist her consuming desire--even though she knows she&#39;ll have to pay a price for it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
