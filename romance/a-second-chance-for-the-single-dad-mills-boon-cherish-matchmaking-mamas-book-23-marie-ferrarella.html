  <title>A Second Chance For The Single Dad (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Matchmaking Mamas, Book 23) - Marie Ferrarella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A LITTLE HELP—AND A LOT OF LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since her mother died, nurse practitioner Kayley Quartermain has been searching for somewhere to belong. She wants that somewhere to be her hometown of Bedford, but first she needs a job. Thankfully, her matchmaking godmother offers a solution: a career match—and hopefully a romantic one, too—assisting recently widowed Dr. Luke Dolan at his clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still adjusting to life as a single dad, Luke is reluctant to accept Kayley&#39;s help. Sure, she&#39;s great at her job, and five-year-old Lily adores her, but Luke&#39;s developing strong feelings for Kayley, too. For Lily&#39;s sake, he needs to be careful about whom he lets in. But with Kayley fitting in so perfectly as they rebuild their lives, could she be the one piece they&#39;ve been missing?&lt;/p&gt;
