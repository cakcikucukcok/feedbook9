  <title>Invisible Threads - Priscilla Sacramento</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tito was really enjoying this special daythe last day of 1999, the last day of the twentieth century. He had a great feeling about this evenings celebrations and about the new century that was only hours away. 
Little did he know that the greatest surprise of the evening was to have nothing to do with the special dishes that he and his wife, Pat, were planning to serve, the entertainment they were to offer during the course of this auspicious night, or the gifts that they had so carefully selected for each of their guests. 
You could say that Tito and Pat had been mere instruments in a larger, more complex plan not of their making. It had begun long before either of them were even born, and it would shape their lives and the lives of others in the twenty-first century.
Sacramento seamlessly interlaces an engaging tale of political, historical, and religious congruence.
	Reviewed by Brittany Smith, US Review of Books.
The book is timely and offers gentle encouragement for our troubled times.
