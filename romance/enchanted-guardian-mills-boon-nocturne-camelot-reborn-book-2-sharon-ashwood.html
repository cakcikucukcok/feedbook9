          &lt;strong&gt;A LOVE OF LEGENDARY PROPORTION&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In another time, in a place once known as Camelot, they had been lovers. Torn apart by betrayal and lies, Lancelot Du Lac and Nimueh, the Lady of the Lake, had each suffered greatly. But the magic of the fae had reawakened a man once trapped in stone, and Lancelot was determined to find his long lost love. Only, Nim was desperate to hide her fae soul, as she was marked for death by their mutual enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though centuries apart had not diminished their passion, they would once again face a dangerous test to prove each was the other’s destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
