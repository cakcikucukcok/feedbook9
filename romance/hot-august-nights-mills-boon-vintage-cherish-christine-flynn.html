          &lt;strong&gt;ONE NIGHT. ONE MAN. ONE &lt;em&gt;BIG&lt;/em&gt; MISTAKE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Was there a woman alive who could resist Matt Calloway? If given a choice, most would have said Ashley Kendrick, the eldest daughter in the Kendrick dynasty. Ashley&#39;s poise and reserve were world renowned. But the night Matt reappeared, Ashley&#39;s inhibitions had ended up on the floor next to her clothes!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The one-night stand was coming back to haunt her. Ashley had to work with Matt on a charity project building houses for the disadvantaged. She knew too well how good Matt was with his hands, his success as a contractor notwithstanding. But Ashley was a public figure, watched by the world. A scandalous affair with her brother&#39;s best friend would be completely inappropriate…and somehow inevitable….&lt;/p&gt;
