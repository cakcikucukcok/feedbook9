  <title>Somebody&#39;s Knocking at My Door - Francis Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kristen Wakefield grew up the privileged, beloved daughter and sister of a wealthy family...yet she felt eclipsed by the achievements of her older brother, Adam, a renowned neurosurgeon. In New Orleans, Kristen believes she now has the opportunity to prove herself and forget a rather disastrous past relationship. But life is much harder than she expected in the Big Easy. Then she meets a man from her past, Rafe Crawford...a man battling his own demons and keeping his own secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beautiful, but down-to-earth Angelique Fleming has always had to fight to get what she wanted in a world dominated by men and she has the chip on her shoulder to prove it. Which is why she takes great pleasure working at a local strip club, hoping to expose a few naughty little secrets of the community&#39;s upstanding men. But before she gets all the dirt, she&#39;s going to find out a few things about life, men, and forgiveness she thought she already knew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claudette Thibodeaux Laurent comes from old New Orleans money and had always adhered to the family code: honor above all else. But she shocks polite society when she marries a man much younger than herself, a man everyone suspects is only after her money. Claudette has done her duty to her family and now she wants a little happiness for herself. And yet doubts eventually begin to creep in and she isn&#39;t sure which Maurice loves more: her or her money, as his desire for the finer things in life become more and more lavish. Just exactly how much is her happiness is going to cost her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with Francis Ray&#39;s trademark emotion and passion, &lt;i&gt;Somebody&#39;s Knocking at My Door &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful story of betrayal and forgiveness, love and healing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
