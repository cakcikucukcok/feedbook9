      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reforming the Cowboy: A South Beach Book by Marisa Cleveland&lt;br&gt;Country singer Billy Hardy needs to get back on the charts. His manager assures him headlining the opening of a cafe in South Beach is his best chance at getting back to the big time. If he fails, his career is over for good this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lacey Durant can&#39;t believe opening night includes the country singer she crushed on through college. And her customers agree he&#39;s dreamy. But his playboy reputation threatens her cafe&#39;s image and she can&#39;t afford that. She insists Billy stay with her so she can keep an eye on him, and thwart overenthusiastic fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billy&#39;s charms and Lacey&#39;s sexy curves prove more than either can resist, but she refuses to be just another lyric in his well-known songs of heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;" />
