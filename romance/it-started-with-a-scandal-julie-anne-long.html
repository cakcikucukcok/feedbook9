  <title>It Started with a Scandal - Julie Anne Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lord Philippe Lavay once took to the high seas armed with charm as lethal as his sword, and a stone-cold conviction: he&#39;ll restore his family&#39;s fortune and honor, no matter the cost. Victory is at last within reach&amp;#8212;when a brutal attack snatches it from his grasp and lands him in Pennyroyal Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An afternoon of bliss brings a cascade of consequences for Elise Fountain. She is shunned by her family and ousted from a job she loves, and her survival means a plummet down the social ladder to a position no woman has yet been able to keep: housekeeper to a frighteningly formidable prince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bold and gentle Elise sees past his battered body into Philippe&#39;s barricaded heart . . . and her innate sensuality ignites his blood. Now a man who thought he could never love and a woman who thought she would never again trust must fight an incendiary passion that could be the ruin of them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
