  <title>Proof Of Innocence: Yesterday&#39;s Lies / Devil&#39;s Gambit (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Lisa Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Two classic stories from the New York Times bestselling queen of romantic suspense&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#39;s Lies&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been five years since Trask McFadden betrayed Tory&#39;s trust, landing her father behind bars. She&#39;d hoped Trask was out of her life forever, but now he&#39;s returned to the Lazy W ranch, claiming to have discovered a clue that might prove her father&#39;s innocence. For the sake of her family, Tory&#39;s trying to forgive, but she&#39;s finding it much harder to forget when Trask&#39;s presence begins to stir up feelings she&#39;d thought were long gone….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devil&#39;s Gambit&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Rhodes&#39;s horse farm was in trouble long before she met Zane Sheridan, a breeder with a shady reputation. Yet she can&#39;t help but feel relieved when Zane offers to buy her out. Though Tiffany doesn&#39;t trust him, she&#39;s drawn to him like a magnet. What does this mysterious man want from her…and can she contain her desire long enough to find out?&lt;/p&gt;
