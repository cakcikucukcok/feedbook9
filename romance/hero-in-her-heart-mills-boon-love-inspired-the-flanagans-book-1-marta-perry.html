  <title>Hero in Her Heart (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (The Flanagans, Book 1) - Marta Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Nolie Lang learned at an early age that animals wouldn&#39; t let her down like people did. Her farm was a haven for abandoned animals– and a source of hope for the disabled. But now, to get a crucial grant, Nolie had to work with the most stubborn man she&#39; d ever met, injured firefighter Gabriel Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though Gabe clearly didn&#39; t want to depend on anyone, including God, he and Nolie became reluctant partners. And all too soon the courage she witnessed in his actions disarmed her. But his injury had convinced Gabe he had nothing to offer Nolie. Could God now make Gabe see he&#39; d always be a hero in her heart?&lt;/p&gt;
