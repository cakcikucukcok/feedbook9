  <title>Locked, Loaded, &amp; Lying (Entangled Select Suspense) - Sarah Andre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He might be innocent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or he might be very, very guilty...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympic skier Lock Roane was on top of the world: smashing world records, collecting medals, and basking in the love of a nation and his beautiful heiress girlfriend. It all comes crashing down after Lock discovers his girlfriend had an affair - then wakes from a drunken bender to find himself covered in her blood. Disgraced and dethroned, Lock awaits his murder trial with dread, not knowing if his girlfriend died at his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Jordan Sinclair is out of options. To satisfy her blackmailer, she must get the inside scoop (and its cash reward) on Lock Roane. An attraction to the arrogant athlete was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; part of the plan. Neither is trying to find out what really happened that night. Now Jordan risks everything - including her life - to help the man she&#39;s falling for. A man who just might be a cold-blooded killer...&lt;/p&gt;" />
