  <title>A Duke to Remember - Kelly Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love takes the stage . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Elise deVries is not what she seems. By night, the actress captivates London theatergoers with her chameleon-like ability to slip inside her characters. By day, she uses her mastery of disguise to work undercover for Chegarre &amp; Associates, an elite agency known for its discreet handling of indelicate scandals. But when Elise is tasked with locating the missing Duke of Ashland, she finds herself center stage in a real-life drama. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Noah Ellery left the glamour of the London aristocracy to pursue a simpler life in the country. He&#39;s managed to avoid any complications or entanglements-that is, until he lays eyes on Elise and realizes there&#39;s more to this beautiful woman than meets the eye. But when Elise reveals her real identity-and her true feelings for him-the runaway duke must confront the past he left behind . . . to keep the woman he loves forever." />
