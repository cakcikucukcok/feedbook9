  <title>MARION MARLOWE’S COURAGE - A Brave Girl&#39;s Struggle for Life and Honour - Grace Shirley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The beautiful Marlowe twins, Marion and Dollie are in New York, living in a cheap boarding house and almost penniless. Marion had just found and rescued Dollie from the clutches of Professor Dabroski, the hypnotist, who had abducted her from her home in the country. In rescuing Dollie she had crossed swords with Emile Vorse, a fiend in the attire of a gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;
Discovering who they are, their landlady tries to throw them out, but assistance arrives from an unexpected ally, who puts the landlady in her place. With her money returned the Marlow sisters and their new ally, Miss Allyn, depart Mrs Garvin&amp;rsquo;s shabby establishment.&lt;br /&gt;
Ensconced in new rooms, the next day Dollie responds to an advertisement for a trainee typist and Marion wonders the city looking for work.&lt;br /&gt;
Silas appears, as if from nowhere, and tells Dollie and Marion that he has bought the mortgage to their parents farm. He assumes that because Dollie&amp;rsquo;s reputation is somewhat tarnished, she would readily agree to marry him. He was wrong. With three months grace the sisters start laying plans to rescue their parents.&lt;br /&gt;
But $9.00 is a long way from $500, especially in 1900&amp;rsquo;s New York. What adventures will the sisters plans lead them on and into in their attempt to earn enough to pay the $500 mortgage hanging over their parents&amp;rsquo; lives without breaking the law?&lt;br /&gt;
