          &lt;strong&gt;HE TRUSTED NO ONE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that was his strength…until murder linked his life with that of the victim&#39;s widow. Now Vincent, Earl of Lonsdale, found himself drawn to the haunting vulnerability displayed by Lady Diana Corby. Truly, this was his soul mate! But could she ever really accept him, a man who daily bedded down with deception and danger?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though secrets and lies beset her at every turn, Diana Corby would do whatever she must to protect her children–even if it meant allying herself with Lord Vincent. He might be a man wrapped in a mantle of mystery, but she couldn&#39;t turn down his offer of protection–or the shelter of his arms!&lt;/p&gt;
