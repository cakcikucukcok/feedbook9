      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Best friends since back in the day, Aggy and Nely are as different as two women could possibly be. Aggie&#39;s slim, stylish, and owns an upscale boutique and a long history of no-strings relationships. Nely has a busy baby, a &lt;em&gt;metiche&lt;/em&gt; mother-in-law, and some extra post-pregnancy pounds she can&#39;t quite shed. And when they reconnect at a New Age spa, each friend finds herself wishing just a little that she had the other one&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big mistake!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the metaphysical meddling of a somewhat grumpy guru, Nely is now Aggie and Aggie is Nely&amp;#8212;switching bodies, love lives, families, closets . . . everything! The grass may not be quite as green as it originally appeared. As luck has it, they&#39;ll be stuck this way until the next full moon! And with a husband, his very suspicious mama, a temperamental tot, a business on the brink of disaster, and a sort-of boyfriend&amp;#8212;not to mention a sleazy stalker&amp;#8212;thrown into the mix, Aggie and Nely suddenly find they&#39;re not just walking in each other&#39;s shoes . . . they&#39;re running! &lt;/p&gt;" />
