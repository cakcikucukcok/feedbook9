  <title>Escape From Bridezilla - Jacqueline Demontravel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt; &quot;I will not turn into one of those Wedding Girls.  .  .&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Emily Briggs&#39; mantra from the minute her boyfriend, Henry, proposes. Although she&#39;s crazy in love and has waited for this moment since she was a little girl, she is dead-set against becoming the Bride from Hell. She is not going to wallpaper her kitchen with wedding magazine tear sheets. She is not going to obsess over the date, tracking weather patterns for the slightest hint of rain. But as her &lt;i&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/i&gt; mother tries to pick out her wedding night lingerie, and Henry grows obsessed with &quot;let&#39;s-do-lunch&quot; work meetings, Emily is turning into a bridezilla, leaving no part of Manhattan--from Bergdorf&#39;s dressing rooms to Tiffany&#39;s sparkling cases--unscorched. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only person who seems to understand is J3 Hopper. Easy-going and easy-on-the-eyes, with a love of art and a habit of turning Emily&#39;s crazed tirades into delirious laugh-fests, J3 is the sort of man every manic bride needs--and wants. J3 listens to her woes, laughs at her jokes, and even compliments her clothes. In fact, he&#39;s making her feel just the way Henry made her feel when they first met--and that just may be the biggest problem of all!  But is this just a jittery bride-to-be&#39;s nerves or could this be something more? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;DeMontravel&#39;s style is smart and sassy.  .  .her wit is as sharp as her characters. &lt;br&gt;This is a fun romp.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;" />
