  <title>A Gift of Grace - Amy Clipston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Take a trip to Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, where you&amp;rsquo;ll meet the women of the Kauffman Amish Bakery in Lancaster County. As each woman&amp;rsquo;s story unfolds, you will share in her heartaches, trials, joys, dreams &amp;hellip; and secrets. You&amp;rsquo;ll discover how the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle can clash with the &amp;ldquo;English&amp;rdquo; way of life&amp;mdash;and the decisions and consequences that follow. Most importantly, you will be encouraged by the hope and faith of these women, and the importance they place on their families. Rebecca Kauffman&amp;rsquo;s tranquil Old Order Amish life is transformed when she suddenly has custody of her two teenage nieces after her &quot;English&quot; sister and brother-in-law are killed in an automobile accident. Instant motherhood, after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive a child of her own, is both a joy and a heartache. Rebecca struggles to give the teenage girls the guidance they need as well as fulfill her duties to Daniel as an Amish wife. Rebellious Jessica is resistant to Amish ways and constantly in trouble with the community. Younger sister Lindsay is caught in the middle, and the strain between Rebecca and Daniel mounts as Jessica&amp;rsquo;s rebellion escalates. Instead of the beautiful family life she dreamed of creating for her nieces, Rebecca feels as if her world is being torn apart by two different cultures, leaving her to question her place in the Amish community, her marriage, and her faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
