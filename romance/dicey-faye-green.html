  <title>Dicey - Faye Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All of lifes drama does not happen in life&#39;s first five decades.   Dicey is the story of new life after a long marriage, retirement, and the natural aging process.  A gambler and a widow search for happiness against all odds. 
	Delores Grant, nicknamed Dicey, walked to the hospital bedside where David King, life-time friend and gambler, pressed a wad of money in her hand, emphatically pointed his index finger at her and with his thumb indicated the door.  He asked her to come, and now without explanation, told her to leave.  Thus, intrigue began for the quiet widow who had never controlled that much cash in her lifelet alone illegal gambling payoffs. In the next few days she took care of Davids business, even made bookie collections.  Now, she was fully involved in his illegal career because he needed and loved her.
	One of Davids clients, Jacques Marquette, took special interest in Dicey and soon they were mutually attracted and fell in love.  After several wonderful days together and a runaway weekend, Jacques was sure she would not go back to David.  Dicey made her choice.  David faced cancer and made his own death choice in a mysterious trip to Haiti.
	Dicey embraces the margins of life stretching forward.  Young couples believe they have decades of dreams before them when actually they only have one day promisedand in that respectdo not differ from senior couples who have learned to live one day at a time.
	Dicey takes place in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., Delaware, and an unnamed village in Haiti." />
