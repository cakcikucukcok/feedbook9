          &lt;strong&gt;Once smitten, twice wed. She still loved him–but could she marry him again?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Clay Saunders finally realized that his adventurous life-style was no substitute for his ex-wife and son, it was too late. Rebecca was all set to marry the reliable &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; man in her life. Clay, she decided, would just have to accept that he&#39;d lost her forever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then she made the fatal mistake of taking him back for a spell while he recovered from an accident. Playing the perfect patient, Clay began his campaign to win her back!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six-year-old Jimmy clearly wanted his daddy to stay for good. Could Rebecca be persuaded to give him another chance, too?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;The four Kelleher women, bound together by family and love.&lt;/em&gt;
