  <title>Temptation In Lingerie - Gina Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bare Naked Designs, #2 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Are you willing to risk it all and give in to temptation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Carrie Taylor can&#39;t believe her luck. Along with her own lingerie line she&#39;s now the proud owner of Satin and Lace, a specialty lingerie store. She has everything she&#39;s ever wanted.  .  .except Aleks Turko. After a lifetime spent pining over the man she can never have, Carrie decides to take back her love life. Vowing to get him out of her system once and for all, she propositions Aleks for a one night stand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Growing up without a mother and with an uncommunicative father, Aleks Turko sought comfort in the arms of the Taylor family. As an adult, he now has everything he needs &amp;#8211; a second family, good friends, and a bottomless barrel of women. But over the last few months vivid, sexual thoughts about Carrie have become a regular occurrence. He&#39;s managed to keep his urges at bay, but when he walks in on her wearing one of her lacy designs, all bets are off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When what was supposed to be a one-time affair snowballs into a battle of wills, Carrie and Aleks must decide if they should risk everything and give in to temptation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; WARNING: Contains explicit language, sex and an unorthodox use of a fitting room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;33,368 Words" />
