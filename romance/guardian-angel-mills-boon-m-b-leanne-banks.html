  <title>Guardian Angel (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Leanne Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;All Talia McKenzie wants from Trace Barringer is his money–in the form of a donation to her charity. The last thing she needs is the arrogant and sexy businessman muscling his way on to the committee.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He may have been the object of her girlhood fantasies, but she stopped believing in fairy tales long ago. Falling for a Barringer, no matter how tempting he is, would mean betraying her own family…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trace doesn&#39;t recognize Talia as the girl he once called his guardian angel. But he does know a challenge when he sees one–and the beautiful deli owner is a definite challenge. Trace is used to getting what he wants, and he wants Talia.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the passion between them reaching a fever pitch, Talia can&#39;t deny her attraction to Trace for long. But how can they build a future when she can&#39;t forgive the past?&lt;/p&gt;
