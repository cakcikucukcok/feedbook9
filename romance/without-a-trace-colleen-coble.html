  <title>Without a Trace - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bree thinks a plane crash took the lives of her husband and young son, but her son Davy survived the accident. Can she find him before it&amp;AElig;s too late?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;AElig;s been months since the crash. K-9 search-and-rescue worker Bree Nicholls knows the chances of finding her husband and son in the vast wilderness of Michigan&amp;AElig;s Upper Peninsula grow more remote by the day. But her heart and her faithful dog, Samson, demand she keep searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the woods a young boy wakes in a tiny cabin. He&amp;AElig;s being nursed back to health by a reclusive woman, but he can&amp;AElig;t figure out why she calls him by a name he doesn&amp;AElig;t recognize. Or why she&amp;AElig;s calling herself his mother. He wants to leave, but as winter sets in, his very life depends on her care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bree&amp;AElig;s relentless determination to find her family has uncovered a violent crime. With the help of Park Ranger Kade Matthews, she discovers the violence may be linked to the plane crash that took her family. Could solving the crime bring her peace with her own loss? Or, more incredibly, reunite her family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the untamed beauty of Michigan&amp;AElig;s Upper Peninsula, the Rock Harbor novels draw readers into the life and adventures of a canine search-and-rescue team as it unravels the secrets of an enchanting wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
