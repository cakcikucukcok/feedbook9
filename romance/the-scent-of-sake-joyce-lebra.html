  <title>The Scent of Sake - Joyce Lebra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She was taught to submit, to obey . . . but she dreamed of an empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sole heir to the House of Omura, a venerable family of Kobe sake brewers, nineteen-year-old Rie hears but cannot heed her mother&#39;s advice: that in nineteenth-century Japan, a woman must &quot;kill the self&quot; or her life will be too difficult to bear. In this strict, male-dominated society, women may not even enter the brewery&amp;#8212;and repressive tradition demands that Rie turn over her family&#39;s business to the inept philanderer she&#39;s been forced to marry. She is even expected to raise her husband&#39;s children by another woman&amp;#8212;a geisha&amp;#8212;so that they can eventually run the Omura enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rie&#39;s pride will not allow her to relinquish what is rightfully hers. With courage, cunning, brilliance, and skill, she is ready to confront every threat that arises before her&amp;#8212;from prejudice to treachery to shipwrecks to the insidious schemes of relentless rivals&amp;#8212;in her bold determination to forge a magnificent dynasty...and to, impossibly, succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epic and breathtaking saga that spans generations as it sweeps through the heart of a century, Joyce Lebra&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Sake&lt;/em&gt; is a vivid and powerful entry into another world...and an unforgettable portrait of a woman who would not let that world defeat her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
