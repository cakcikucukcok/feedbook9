  <title>Alanna - Kathleen Bittner Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Gripped me from the opening page.  .  .kept me reading long into the night.&quot; --Jodi Thomas&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Wolf caught the faint scent of cinnabar and roses.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;The girl turned her head and stared boldly at him, her cool demeanor at odds with the fire in her look. And then her lips parted, as if she needed more air. A punch of lust hit Wolf&#39;s groin. &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;There was pure sin in his startling blue eyes. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;The moment hung suspended between them, and then expanded as his feral gaze held hers. Stranger? Not to Alanna. He went by the name of Wolf, and he was a legend in these parts, known from San Francisco to Boston as a relentless tracker of lost persons. His quest to find his mother&#39;s killer would lead him to Alanna...and his destiny. &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;In his arms, she would never be lost again.  .  . &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;The sexual tension barrels ahead right to the end.&quot;  -Leigh Greenwood, &lt;I&gt;USA Today&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author&lt;P&gt;&quot;Ms. Bittner Roth weaves a tale of mystery, seduction and love.
