  <title>Rev It Up - Julie Ann Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Julie Ann Walker&#39;s Black Knights series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &quot;Walker is ready to join the ranks of great romantic suspense writers.&quot;—&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  A &quot;first–rate thrill ride.&quot;—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, stared review on &lt;em&gt;Hell on Wheels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Deft characterization, skillful pacing, touches of humor, and red–hot love scenes rev up this highly recommended roller–coaster.&quot; —&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, starred review on&lt;em&gt; In Rides Trouble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Never Misses A Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Sommers earned his SEAL code name by striking quickly and quietly-and with lethal force. That&#39;s also how he broke Michelle Carter&#39;s heart. It was the only way to keep her safe-from himself. Four long years later, Jake is determined to get a second chance. But to steal back into Michelle&#39;s loving arms, Jake is going to have to prove he can take things slow. Real slow...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She Aims To Make Him Beg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Michelle Carter has never forgiven Jake for being so cliché as to &quot;love her and leave her.&quot; But when her brother, head of the Black Knights elite ops agency, ticks off the wrong mobster, she must do the unimaginable: place her life in Jake&#39;s hands. No matter what they call him, this man is far from cold-blooded. And once he&#39;s wrapped around her heat, he&#39;ll never let her go...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
