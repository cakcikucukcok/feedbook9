      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Antonio DeLuca knows exactly what he wants in life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lucia Bonavera knows exactly what she doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Destiny has something completely different in mind for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Betrothed at birth but never having met, pragmatic inkeeper, Lucia, and sexy architect, Antonio, consider their grandfathers&amp;#39; thirty-year-old marriage pact a meaningless relic. Neither had any interest in meeting the other, but when Antonio travels to the States on holiday, his grandfather blackmails him into visiting Lucia at her family&amp;#39;s winery in the Virginia foothills. When he does, their mutual disinterest is replaced by an unexpected, yet undeniable attraction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When Antonio makes a decision that keeps him in the States indefinitely, Lucia decides she&amp;#39;s tired of always playing things safe, and follows her heart, straight into Antonio&amp;#39;s welcoming arms. But Antonio has a secret, one that impacts Lucia as much as him. A secret that could destroy her trust in him forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
