  <title>Arrival in Los Angeles (#1 of California Dreaming): A Los Angeles Series - Andrew J. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Alliston, a famous New York writer, is struggling with his arrival in Los Angeles. After being left by his wife, and with a small child, he will try to rebuild a new life in the city where he grew up, under the advice of his best friend and literary agent, Andy Jackson. Despite being more than willing to put his head in order once and for all, he immediately finds himself in unseemly scenarios that make him lose some of his credibility and seriousness as a writer. His arrival in Los Angeles will be impetuous and although he does not want to be immediately recognized by the literary and film scene, his fame, and that of his agent, precede them, but not in a positive way. In the meantime, his agent will have to deal with his small flaws of lust, all under the watchful eyes of his wife. Old acquaintances will present themselves and he will have to deal with them, while, struggling with a real contract for his new novel, he will have to settle in the warm metropolis full of memories of his past. Between spicy clichés, passionate sex, and unseemly scenes, James Alliston will begin his new life in Los Angeles. California Dreaming is a fun and tantalizing, sensual and profound series that will give free space to the reader&#39;s imagination to get lost in the world of the famous fantasy writer, in a captivating first chapter of a romantic and exciting series." />
