  <title>The Story of Charlie Mullins: The Man in the Middle - Jim Wygand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlie Mullins, a divorced executive at a large company, falls in love with a woman who he initially doesn&#39;t know could destroy his entire career. Charlie is convinced that she is his true soul mate and will not give her up even though it would mean the loss of his job and career if it became public knowledge. The company he works for has military defense contracts and he would not be given a security clearance once his relationship to Gina was known. He will have to choose between the woman and his career.  &lt;br&gt;While he faces this choice, a couple of busybody housewives from the small town in which he was raised and still lives have taken to stalking him because of his secret relationship and their interest in marrying him off to a local woman. They feel threatened by his behavior, and their response threatens his ability to keep the relationship secret while he devises a plan to marry the woman of his dreams. If the relationship becomes known before Charlie is ready and has worked out his plan, all will be lost.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;This is Jim Wygand&#39;s third book and his first novel. Jim is a business consultant who has worked in and with large corporations during his long and varied career. In his first novel, Jim has pitted parochial small town gossips against the desire for privacy of a native son and the inner workings and politics of a large multinational corporation. The admixture could prove disastrous to Charlie Mullins and his professional and personal plans." />
