  <title>When a Lady Kisses a Scot - Tara Kingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rose Fleming has been presumed dead for the last decade. It required leaving everything--and everyone--she loved behind, including MacAllister Campbell. But faking her death allowed her to stay safe until the threat posed by a mysterious villain had passed. Believing it&#39;s finally safe again, she returns...and runs smack into the only man she ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rose was wrong and the stalker she escaped years ago still has her in his sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Mac mourned the death of the woman he loved. It&#39;s taken years to heal his heart only to discover that not only is Rose still alive, but still in grave danger. Mac can forgive Rose&#39;s deception, but he&#39;d never be able to forgive himself if he didn&#39;t protect her from the evil still stalking her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing worse than losing her once would be losing her again... and he won&#39;t let that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Her Majesty&#39;s Most Secret Service series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* When a Lady Deceives&lt;br&gt;* When a Lady Dares&lt;br&gt;* When a Lady Desires a Wicked Lord&lt;br&gt;* When a Lady Kisses a Scot&lt;/p&gt;" />
