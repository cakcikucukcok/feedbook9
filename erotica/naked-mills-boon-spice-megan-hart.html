  <title>Naked (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Megan Hart</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;No strings. No regrets. And no going back. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t think he wanted me. And I wasn&#39;t about to get involved with him, not after what I&#39;d heard. Sure, Alex Kennedy was tall, dark and unbearably hot, but I&#39;ve been burned before. When I solicited him to model for my erotic photography book, I didn&#39;t expect such a heated, passionate photo session. And now that we&#39;ve crossed that line, our bodies aren&#39;t the only things that have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But I can&#39;t give my heart to a man who&#39;s so… unconventional. His last sexual relationship was with a married couple. It&#39;s enough that my ex-fiancé preferred men, I can&#39;t take that chance again no matter how much my body thrives on Alex&#39;s touch. I can&#39;t risk it, but I can&#39;t resist it, either. Alex can be very convincing when he wants something. And he wants me.&lt;/p&gt;
