      <meta name="description" content="Beefy Side of Life contains two erotic stories about big, beautiful, heavyset men who are on the stocky through to chunkier end of the scale. These stories have previously been published as stand alone titles.  Chubby Love  Red is a widower who was married to a big, beautiful woman. Hobie is a gay chub who finds the slimly-built Red very attractive. Red notices the chub&#39;s interest in him, and the fact that Hobie has huge manboobs, which he find strangely enticing. Little by little, Red begins to explore his feelings for the chubby dude, and he begins to wonder if he has it in his power to make the young man happy.  Micro Husky  Cliff is a man like no other. He is big, beefy and furry but has been seriously short-changed in the trouser department. In fact, there is nothing to be seen there at all. Blaine doesn&#39;t give a fig about that. What he discovers, at his local health spa, is one the biggest, furriest, shapeliest rumps he has ever seen and he knows that he wants the older man." />
