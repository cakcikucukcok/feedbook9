  <title>Wake Up - Jack Stratton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slowly waking up in the morning, two lovers play a new game. Bondage, rough sex, and erotic facesitting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she clicked shut the first cuff on my wrist, I raised an eyebrow. She gave me innocent eyes; I yawned. She lazily walked around the bed and pulled my other hand into the other handcuff. Then she made her way to the foot of the bed and found the rope I&amp;rsquo;d left there. I looked down, straining my neck a bit as she tried to approximate the knot I&amp;rsquo;d made around her ankles a few hours before. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how accurate it was, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pull my legs free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She pulled the blanket and the sheet off of me and I felt, suddenly, the weight of my powerlessness. She looked down at me with her hands on her hips, naked, smiling, planning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you ready to earn your coffee?&amp;rdquo; she said with a challenging glint in her eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll be cold by then,&amp;rdquo; I answered calmly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She rolled her eyes and knelt on the bed next to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The slap was, to be honest, a little too hard and a little too close to my ear. The world swam and spun for a moment." />
