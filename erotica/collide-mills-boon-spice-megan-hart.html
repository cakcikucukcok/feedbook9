  <title>Collide (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Megan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;A childhood accident left Emmaline vulnerable to disturbing fugue states that last minutes but feel like an eternity. The blackouts are unsettling but manageable. . . until she meets Johnny Dellasandro. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The painter gained fame in the &#39;70s for his debauched lifestyle and raunchy art films. His naked body achieved cult status, especially in Emm&#39;s mind, she&#39;s obsessed with the man, who&#39;s grown even sexier with age. Today he shuns the spotlight and Emm. . . until she falls into a fugue on his doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In that moment she&#39;s transported back thirty years, crashing a party at Johnny&#39;s place. The night is a blur of flesh and heat that lingers long after she&#39;s woken to the present. It happens again and again, each time-slip a mind-blowing orgy, and soon Emm can&#39;t stop, though every episode leaves her weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s scared by what&#39;s happening, but she&#39;s even more terrified of losing this portal to the Johnny she wants so badly. The one who wants her and takes her every chance he gets.&lt;/p&gt;
