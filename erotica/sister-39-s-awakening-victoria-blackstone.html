  <title>Sister&#39;s Awakening - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
I had it all: a tall, handsome man, a warm, cozy home, a ring of promise on my finger... But as time passed I began to wonder if maybe I&amp;rsquo;d promised myself to the wrong man. My allegiance to my fianc&amp;eacute; began to falter the moment my brother began to ease himself into me, and any remaining commitment to him evaporated the moment Connor bottomed out in me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
I bit my lip to keep from smiling. I cleared my throat then again leaned over him, brushing my lips to his. Before he could speak, I moved my lips to his ear and nibbled it. &amp;ldquo;We were kissing,&amp;rdquo; I whispered, my stomach rolling with nerves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pulled back to see his eyes, lip caught in my teeth. He studied me a moment, likely trying to make sense of my words. His brows drawn, he said, &amp;ldquo;Like, chaste?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Seriously?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, unable to suppress a smile. At his confused look, I closed the distance between us, pressing my lips to his then deepening the kiss, teasing his tongue with my own. I pulled back to focus on his eyes, smiling, shy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, biting my lip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Jesus, baby.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head, the smile leaving. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sorry, I...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I held his gaze, waiting, hoping he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put a stop to my fun. His gaze dropped to my nightie, to my chest. &amp;ldquo;And you want to go out there like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, my excitement, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, showing in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re showing,&amp;rdquo; he said, his tone low and husky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t mind if he sees you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s been looking since we were kids.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded slowly. &amp;ldquo;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to just look, does he?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head, and for several long moments our gazes remained locked, my eyes full of excitement, his full of questions. He blew out a breath. &amp;ldquo;And if I tell you I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable with you going out there like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded, waiting, anxious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, he blew out a breath. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t keep you from him, can I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I cupped his cheek, willing him not to make me choose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He continued to hold my gaze. Eventually, though, he nodded. &amp;ldquo;Go spend some time with your brother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gave him my warmest smile, then I leaned down to kiss him. &amp;ldquo;I love you,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And I, you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I moved toward the door, my gaze on his, a smile pulling my lips. I stopped in the doorway, my conscience screaming at me to clarify my intentions, to give him all the information he needed to make an informed decision. I knew, of course, that if he was fully aware of my intentions, he could put his foot down, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want this to come back to bite me. No, he deserved my honesty. My gaze on his, I ran my hand in small circles around my belly, building up my courage, then, before I could change my mind, I reached for my panties, and held his gaze as I slipped them over my hips and down my thighs. I brought them up to my nose and inhaled, my scent filling my head as I walked slowly back to him. I set them on his pillow, beside his head, then backed toward the door, my gaze on his, his moving back and forth from my eyes to my thighs and back again. He didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me when I reached for the door handle, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me when I raised my hand, wiggling my fingers at him. He remained silent as I pulled the door closed." />
