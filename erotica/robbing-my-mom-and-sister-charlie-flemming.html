  <title>Robbing My Mom and Sister - Charlie Flemming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Rob still needs to get money and still needs what&amp;#39;s in his mom&amp;#39;s safe. However, this time his home invasion is when his sister is home as well. Is he going to get what&amp;#39;s in the safe, or is he going to fuck the shit our of his hot mother and sister instead?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
My cock was straining in my pants watching my gorgeous mother and sister exposing themselves to me. But I needed what was in the safe or the mob was going to kill me, &amp;ldquo;Look, don&amp;rsquo;t make me pull this thing out and-&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom!&amp;rdquo; Carol suddenly shouted, &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s going to pull his thing out! And our pussies are out in the open!&amp;rdquo; She didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fully understand what was happening here either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Am I being unclear about something?&amp;rdquo; I asked, just feeling downright confused, &amp;ldquo;I mean, all I want is-&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just shut the fuck up and lick my pussy.&amp;rdquo; Mom ordered as she stuck her ass up further in the air. &amp;ldquo;And you better make this home invasion worth our while.&amp;rdquo;" />
