Darren . . . The Good. Hes charming, polite, nonconfrontational, a gentleman, and a sweetheart in search of true love. Hes the one that youll get to know first. Darren is the one who is passionate and slow during lovemaking. Hes marriage material.	
Chuck . . . The Bad. The troublemaker of the trio who is calculated in his approach. Chuck wants to dominate all parts of your bodymaking love isnt his forte. Hes aggressive, unrelenting and requires a different type of sexual satisfaction. Chuck is the one you better get to know or else hell venture elsewhere.
Nino . . . The Insatiable. His personality is downright ugly when its tested. Confrontations are his specialty, so follow his commandsor suffer the consequences. His high testosterone impulses must be fulfilled, preferably through intense, sexually selfish domination. If Nino is having a bad day, look out, or you might be the recipient of his thrashing." />
