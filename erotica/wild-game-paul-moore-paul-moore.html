  <title>Wild Game -  Paul Moore, Paul Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Note: illustrations will appear only in the Microsoft version of this book. Crystal is completely devoted to her Mistress - mind, body and soul. Even the cruel tests of endurance and loyalty that her Mistress subjects her to leave her fidelity unshaken. During a Summer outing, however, Mistress proposes a simple game of hide and seek that turns deadly serious when Crystal becomes lost in the forest. Hunters - rough, backwoods brutes find her naked in the woods and Crystal believes she&#39;s been saved. But her rescuers quickly reveal that they are really cruel abductors, bent on brutally using her body until they break her. Planning to sell her as a sex slave, she&#39;s held captive in a crude cellar, abused over a sawhorse, forced to take their beatings and perform on command - faced with the choice of grieving for her lost love or embracing life as the sexual toy of her new owners. &quot;My final descent into slavery has required only one small final step toward the abyss. It is as though the last year has been a prologue to this moment. Below the surface, under my desperate terror, is a sort of acceptance, a feeling of inevitability and calm. Mistress taught me to enjoy the simple pleasures that come my way, and accept them with gratitude. In this level of hell I have found the true heart of masochism, where the pain becomes the end and not the means.&quot;" />
