  <title>You Like To Watch - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s the first night of Laura and Phil&#39;s vacation and she&#39;s looking forward to some seriously hot sex, and letting Phil watch! Phil is always upset when she dresses slutty and picks up men to bring back to their house, but Laura knows that&#39;s all part of his game, denying the fact he loves it.
When bad weather keeps them from leaving the hotel, Phil gloats she&#39;s not going to get what she wants tonight. But when room service is delivered by a good looking young stud named Kevin, Laura&#39;s the one gloating! She plans on giving Kevin the tip of a lifetime and as always Phil is left to just sit and watch. Or is he?
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
“Kevin.” He said, giving her another nervous smile, “Well, I’ll let you folks enjoy your evening.”
“What’s the hurry honey?” She purred, “With this weather you can’t have a lot of people checking in.”
“No, it’s pretty slow.” He said glumly, “Not many people on a Thursday, never mind the way this storm kicked in. This was the first trip to a room I’ve made in an hour.”
“Aww, that must suck, especially for tips.” She told him. “You like tips?” She cocked her head and winked, “Nice big firm tips.” Laura stared him in the eye, “Seems like you’ve been looking for some.” She lowered her gaze pointedly to her chest where her nipples were prominently displayed through the robe. “So you have no reason to hurry back down to the desk do you, Kevin?”
“Um, no.” He returned her smile, and her stare, his eyes once again seeking her tits, but this time not trying to hide it.
A wave of heat flowed through her when she realized he wasn’t that nervous or naïve.
“That’s good to hear.” She cooed delightedly, “Because you’re right, it’s pretty slow around here and I’d love some company.” Laura stepped closer to him and lowered her voice to a seductive purr, “You want to keep me company, baby?”
She turned from him and slowly strolled over near the couch, putting some extra swing in her hips and getting wetter by the second as she felt his eyes on her. She stopped in front of the couch and turned to see Phil, standing in front of her.
“Don’t you dare.” He hissed.
“Go sit down.” She told him, pointing at the chair across from the couch. When he didn’t move she added, “Now.”
Their eyes met and within seconds he lowered his gaze and obediently walked over and sat down.
While speaking, Laura had grabbed the ends of the belt of her robe. She tugged them slightly, just enough for the robe to open a little more. Enough to show more of her breasts, right down to the edge of the pink skin surrounding her nipples.
“Laura!” Phil spoke up, “The kid has to get back to work.”
“Oh, he’ll be working.” Kevin was now standing in front of her, “You’ll be working hard for me won’t you?”
She put her hands briefly on his stomach and shivered at how hard and flat it felt. She wanted to see what else was hard, but instead, lightly caressed his cheeks with her fingers before beginning to unbutton his shirt.
Her eyes were on his and despite the way they widened in surprise; he made no attempt to move, just stood there staring at her, a look of desire spreading across his face.
“You could get him…”
“Oh, just shut up!” She snapped, still unhurriedly working her way down Kevin’s shirt. To her chagrin he stepped back from her and glanced at Phil.
“But, that’s your husband right?”
“Right and my husband loves to watch me bang other guys, especially young hot guys.”
“He doesn’t seem to.” Even as he spoke he let her start again on his shirt. His eyes were bright and she noticed him trembling.
“He loves it, don’t you Phil?” She stared over at him, “You like to watch, don’t you?”
“Yes.” He said softly.
“Why do you like it, Phil? Tell him why,” she breathed, her hands trembling in anticipation as she fondled his well muscled chest and stomach.
“Because I love seeing her satisfied and I can’t satisfy her.”" />
