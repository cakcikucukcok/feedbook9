  <title>My Promiscuous Amsterdam - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amsterdam&#39;s infamous Red Light district with its taunting prostitutes, Porn Shop windows, live sex shows and dangerous S&amp;M sex luridly beckons Marlena with a crooked finger. The aspiring young artist from the American Midwest wins a scholarship to an exclusive art school in this foreign city. But when she arrives, she&#39;s suddenly thrown to the erotic wolves of her own teaming, pent-up lust. Without her husband, Neil, to take care of her she&#39;s lost and confused, unable to restrain her immoral thoughts. Even her arrogant art instructor, Roelf Jansz, baits her. Berating her insipid, uninspired life, he insists she pose as his live model. When she refuses the outrageous request, her erotic conflict only becomes more brutal. Frantic for someone to guide her, she turns to a friendly stranger she meets in the hotel bar. Jackson Nichols, gorgeously handsome, steady and kind, he knows her like a book, and yet, his sexual charisma arouses everything she hopes to deny. He walks her through the Red Light District, urges her to accept Roelf&#39;s modeling offer, and with subtle but commanding sincerity leads her down the path of her submissive nature. She tries to resist her inner hunger, but cannot. Marlena&#39;s guilt over her marriage conspires to stop her, but she seems destined to exchange her wedding ring for Jackson&#39;s leather cuffs. As his sworn property, she&#39;s obliged to follow his every order, to submit to the punishment she yearns for, the sexual use she craves and the tawdry exhibitions at the hands of strangers. A visit from her husband changes nothing, she&#39;s another man&#39;s property now. Her dazed husband can only sit and watch in disbelief as she performs vulgar sexual acts on demand." />
