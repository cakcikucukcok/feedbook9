  <title>Spanked On Her Wedding Day - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victoria is to be married to man she never met. The Duke of Sutherland may be dark and handsome, but he is a stranger to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But the Duke of Sutherland has a dark side that Vicky never dreamed possible. His twisted desires awaken a passion inside her that she never thought possible, as pleasure and pain mingle into one sinful, delicious whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Vicky, there is no but. Your father ensured you would be adequately provided for by agreeing to this marriage with Sutherland&amp;#39;s father.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a gasp, Vicky turned to look at her step-mother. &amp;quot;You mean the current Duke of Sutherland isn&amp;#39;t the one who arranged the match? How do you know that he even wanted to marry me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What does it matter dear? He wants you now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s made the whole thing even worse!&amp;quot; Vicky wailed. &amp;quot;He didn&amp;#39;t even arrange the marriage himself. And why didn&amp;#39;t he perform a proper courtship? Why is he waiting until the day we are to be wed for me to meet him? Is he disfigured? Lame?&amp;quot; Vicky gave another shudder. She might end up with a man she would have to spend the rest of her life taking care of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hush child, there is nothing wrong with the Duke. He is quite dashing, if a tad unconventional. He prefers his country estate, which is why you&amp;#39;ve never seen him up and about London. But I&amp;#39;m sure once he has a pretty wife on his arm he&amp;#39;ll be far more visible.&amp;quot; She smiled, and a far-away look came into her eyes. &amp;quot;To think you will be the Duchess of Sutherland, mother to the future Duke.&amp;quot;" />
