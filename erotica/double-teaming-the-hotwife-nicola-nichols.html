  <title>Double Teaming The Hotwife - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two men can be better than one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She loves Dave, but when it comes to sex, he can&amp;#39;t keep up. When they move into a new apartment, she learns that the building&amp;#39;s twin hunky maintenance men are willing to help her with that little problem. When they double down on her, both giving her the benefit of their full attention, the world seems a better place. But where is that leading?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knew she shouldn&amp;#39;t have given Dave such a hard time about everything that was wrong with the apartment. It wasn&amp;#39;t all his fault; she&amp;#39;d helped pick it out. She&amp;#39;d thought it was great and agreed to sign the lease. In retrospect, she&amp;#39;d gotten caught up in them finding their first place together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When they got married, they moved into his studio apartment. It was tiny and pretty awful. When he got a new job, making more money, they&amp;#39;d started looking for something better. They&amp;#39;d found this one and glamorized it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that she was here, she found there was a lot to dislike. Somehow it didn&amp;#39;t seem like the same place as when they did the walkthrough&amp;nbsp; when they&amp;#39;d first looked at it. But now that she was setting her things up in it, she found lots of things not to like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right off the bat, she&amp;#39;d realized that her parking spot was a long way from the elevator. That would be a pain on shopping days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a monotony to the place too. Everything was neutral. No color.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final straw was the dishwasher. She washed things as she unpacked them, and that&amp;#39;s when she discovered that the dishwasher was probably a piece of crap that would die on her at any moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those things made her certain she&amp;#39;d find more wrong as she learned about the place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, like Dave said when she bitched at him about her issues, it wasn&amp;#39;t like they could afford anything better. And this one had some nice features, not the least of which was that it was convenient... close to the office where he worked. &amp;quot;You work at home,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And now you have room.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was true. But it also meant that she would be the one dealing with those myriad little things, with all the problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had to admit that the place had a great balcony. The view wasn&amp;#39;t anything spectacular, but it did give her a view she liked, overlooking the city, seeing it alive and humming below her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Looking down made her smile, remembering their first night in the apartment. After the movers left, they&amp;#39;d worked until dinner time, then Dave had led her out there and they&amp;#39;d touched as they looked at the city lights. He had kissed her, making her feel all warm." />
