  <title>Dominated By Three Hunters - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daisy likes to take a little exercise by strolling alone in the woods. But today she is going to be put through her paces in a different way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three hot, alpha male hunters have decided to teach her a real good lesson. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once, rough, hard and without protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, I stepped into their campsite. There were three tents, along with a log bench and several duffel bags filled to the brim with hunting equipment. I shivered - hunters usually weren&amp;#39;t the most pleasant bunch. Trembling, I approached the man closest to me - a brunet with uneven stubble and impressive biceps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Excuse me-&amp;quot; I mumbled. &amp;quot;My name&amp;#39;s Daisy - I&amp;#39;m lost. I was wondering if you and your friends know how to get back to the city-&amp;quot; My voice was cracking and hoarse, totally unsexy. I hoped that these men were decent enough to pity me. When the brunet turned to face me, I actually jumped a little in shock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Daisy, huh? My name&amp;#39;s Kevin. Sure- I guess me and the guys can help you. But really, we&amp;#39;re not just gonna give you directions for free.&amp;quot; He stated vaguely, voice rich and deep. I felt my cheeks heat up - Kevin was an attractive man by any standards, by far the most attractive I&amp;#39;d seen in a while. The guys at work couldn&amp;#39;t hold a candle to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He turned to look at his friends - one a blond of less impressive height but more impressive bulk, the other a noiret of an imposing height.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Guys - c&amp;#39;mon over. We have a little visitor.&amp;quot; Kevin grinned, and though I didn&amp;#39;t like the condescension inherent in his tone, I stayed put, nervous grin plastered stupidly on my face as always. I was sure that I looked a mess, cheeks pink and hair frizzy. I prayed that these men were just playful, the sort of guys with crude senses of humor." />
