  <title>Popping Cherry - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cherry likes to tease. Nothing makes her more excited than leading men on, then dropping them before they can go too far.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But a long weekend with Sam provides unforeseen temptations. He&amp;rsquo;s not one to take her teasing ways lying down. Unless he&amp;#39;s lying down with her! Because Sam has a dominant side. And he&amp;#39;s dedicated the weekend to&amp;hellip;Popping Cherry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m glad we were able to spend some time together, Sam.&amp;rdquo; She made her voice a caress. &amp;ldquo;Who knows when we&amp;#39;ll be able to hang out again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He shrugged, keeping his eye on his bobber, which had begun to move in an interesting fashion. Did he have a fish on the line? &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re welcome to come up and visit any time you like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not like that, Sam.&amp;rdquo; She moved closer and let her hand stroke his arm. &amp;ldquo;Alone. Just the two of us.&amp;rdquo; Now, closer still, until the swell of her breast was pressing into the bulge of his bicep. She leaned until she could breathe into his ear. &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;#39;t you like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;She could see the tension building in his body, the way his free hand clenched as he fought for control. &amp;ldquo;Cherry&amp;hellip;don&amp;#39;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;#39;t what?&amp;rdquo; she teased, letting her hand fall oh-so-casually on his thigh. Slowly she moved it higher, until it was resting over the hot bulge of his crotch. &amp;ldquo;My,&amp;rdquo; she breathed. &amp;ldquo;What a&amp;hellip;big&amp;hellip;boy you are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remember, Cherry,&amp;rdquo; the voice seemed to come from a great distance. &amp;ldquo;I warned you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wha&amp;hellip;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Her head spun as she found herself thrown suddenly to the ground. Her arms were stretched up high over her head, her wrists pinioned effortlessly in one of Sam&amp;#39;s large hands. His other hand was engaged in pulling her shirt up over her head, a task which he managed with ridiculous ease.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sam, what are you doing?&amp;rdquo; Her voice was high and thready.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exactly what you want me to do,&amp;rdquo; he gritted. He used her shirt to bind her wrists together. &amp;ldquo;Wendy told me about the games you like to play. And I&amp;#39;ve seen it myself over the last few days. You&amp;#39;re good, I&amp;#39;ll give you that. You play the shy little vixen to perfection. And I bet you really get off on watching men grovel and beg.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tried to warn you. Remember, the first night? I asked you if you knew what winning would be like? Congratulations,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;ve won. And this is your prize.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He stood and went to the car, returning with a length of clothesline. Wide-eyed, she watched as he tied it firmly around the tree, then to her wrists. Bound, she found herself unable to move more than a few inches to either side. Her mouth grew dry from fear, and another, unnameable emotion. This wasn&amp;#39;t big, gentle Sam, who had barely spoken a harsh word to her in all the years she had known him.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or maybe,&lt;/i&gt; her mind whispered to her, &lt;i&gt;you&amp;#39;re seeing the real Sam for the first time. The one he hasn&amp;#39;t shown to anyone else.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is how it&amp;#39;s going to go, Cherry,&amp;rdquo; he said, kneeling down so he could look her in the eye. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m going to take all your clothes off. And then I&amp;#39;m going to take all of my clothes off. And I&amp;#39;m going to do whatever I want to you.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;#39;t want me to do this,&amp;rdquo; he continued, drawing one finger down her cheek, making her shudder, &amp;ldquo;all you have to do&amp;hellip;is say &amp;#39;no.&amp;#39;&amp;rdquo;" />
