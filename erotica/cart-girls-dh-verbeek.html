  <title>Cart Girls - Dh Verbeek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Mike and Jack walked down the path to the beverage cart but didn&#39;t see anyone attending the beverage cart. &quot;Well, someone must have parked it here,&quot; Jack said, looking over the stocked beverage cart and opening a few containers to inspect the contents. Jack walked around the back of the beverage cart and noticed some sneakers behind a bush. &quot;Mike, look over here,&quot; he said. They pulled back the bush and immediately Mike turned and ran a few feet. He bent over and violently vomited from the sight of what he had just witnessed.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sandy Creek Country Club is thrust into the center of a horrific scandal when one of its cart girls is found murdered on the thirteenth hole of the golf course. Lieutenant Ron Carr, the lead investigator on the case, struggles to connect the meager evidence to any of the suspects.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lieutenant Carr receives help from the county medical examiner, Dr. Jean Loreno, an attractive single mother who is looking for a father for her son, Jake. Carr and Loreno spend hours together examining the evidence and interrogating the long list of suspects-and everyone is a suspect. The two begin to develop feelings for each other, but will the grueling task of solving the murder get in the way of their growing relationship?&lt;/P&gt;" />
