      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In summer, Bellas inn by the lake vibrates with the carnality of a whorehouse in any season.  The young widow, Bella Fauré, wants only to run her beloved Inn and enjoy the men she entertains on the side. Her favorite lover, Daniel, listens to her sexual tales and takes notes for an erotic novel of her stories. But theres a dark side to Bellas life and a reckless past. Her husband&#39;s brother Claude still retains a hold on the lovely submission, one that she cannot easily shake, and time and time again, she plummets into his world in order to satisfy his recurring need. Though she despises the man, she is driven by a body that enjoys the extremes of lust he offers. Claude takes in cellars, attics and the boathouse by the lake, with whips and bondage and other tortures that leave her breathless.  Her sex life overwhelms the imagination. But can she finally cut the ties with Claude? And what of Daniel&#39;s role. A novel brimming with tender sensuality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
