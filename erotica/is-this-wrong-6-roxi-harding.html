  <title>Is This Wrong #6 - Roxi Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&amp;quot; he asks. She looks into his eyes and nods. &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I want you to be my first.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Everybody remembers their first time. But when you&amp;#39;re a little brat and that first time is with the prince of the house&amp;hellip;well, that&amp;#39;s definitely something you&amp;#39;ll never forget!&lt;br /&gt;
Read all about it!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
In between Daniel and his 18-year old stepsister Chloe sits a campfire that Chloe built. It burns merrily, crackling along as the two of them sit together, staring at the flames. Daniel reaches over and picks up one of the pieces of wood he found for kindling. He stokes the fire for a moment, causing sparks to swirl up into the air, and then places the stick among the flames, letting the fire consume it.&lt;br /&gt;
Chloe sits staring into the fire. She wonders what they&amp;#39;re going to do tomorrow&amp;hellip;go for a walk? Take out the canoe? Maybe just forget all those plans and sit around reading and talking.&lt;br /&gt;
So long as she&amp;#39;s with her stepbrother, she&amp;#39;s all right.&lt;br /&gt;
Daniel glances at his stepsister, thinking about what she would look like underneath those clothes, thinking about her tight little body and her innocence. He&amp;rsquo;s been hard in his pants for the last half hour.&lt;br /&gt;
Chloe gets up.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to get a snack from the cooler,&amp;quot; she says to her stepbrother. &amp;quot;Do you want anything?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Daniel considers for a moment and then nods, getting up to join his little sister as she goes to where they&amp;#39;re keeping their food.&lt;br /&gt;
She opens the lid of the cooler and looks inside. Daniel steps up beside her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hmm,&amp;quot; she says, looking around. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what I want to have.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
She looks up at her stepbrother, her eyes meeting with his.&lt;br /&gt;
Everything that Chloe is looks incredible to Daniel. Her tiny little body, the way she looks at him all the time. His arousal stirs in his pants and all he can think about is having sex with her, then filling her womb, giving her a baby.&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s all he can think about right now.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah,&amp;quot; Daniel sighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What is it?&amp;quot; Chloe asks her stepbrother, and Daniel looks at her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah, it&amp;#39;s just&amp;hellip;well, my sex life lately has been&amp;hellip;not so great.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh?&amp;quot; Chloe says, and she looks actually sympathetic.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; Daniel tells her. &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I just need some sort of release.&amp;quot;" />
