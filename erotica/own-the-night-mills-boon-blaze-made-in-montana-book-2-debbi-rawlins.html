  <title>Own the Night (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Made in Montana, Book 2) - Debbi Rawlins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;After several years’ absence, Noah Calder has returned to Blackfoot Falls, Montana to be the town&#39;s sheriff. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He still isn&#39;t sure if this is the life he wants, but he owes his family and he always pays his debts. The last thing he expected was to meet a woman who tempts his sense of duty. But can she bring him to his knees? Alana Richardson has never met a man like him. He&#39;s everything she could want. Could it be that she’s starting to fall hard?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t seem to matter once it all falls apart. Her mother shows up and Alana is humbled to learn she’s not the strong woman she’s always considered herself. She has to make a hard decision. Will she choose Noah? Even after she discovers his interest in her was merely as a suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
