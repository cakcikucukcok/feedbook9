  <title>Seeded by the Neighbor&#39;s Dog - Kimmy Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trish is on summer break from college, and while she is home she is hell-bent on seducing the hot neighbor guy. The first day of summer, she makes sure to strut into her backyard wearing a tiny bikini to sunbathe in. Only problem is, her neighbor isn&#39;t home, but he did leave his dog outside. When the friendly mutt wanders over to say hello, Trish happily accepts the dog&#39;s company. Trish is lonely and horny though, and cuddle time with the neighbor&#39;s friendly dog turns into much, much more than she bargained for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Fine, we can cuddle for a little while I guess,&quot; I resigned, putting my arms around him and hugging. &quot;I guess you don&#39;t get enough love at home, huh?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spread my legs and let the dog lay between them, so I wasn&#39;t losing circulation. A tiny thought popped into my head, acknowledging how it felt kind of nice to have a body between my legs- even if it was just a friendly dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if reading my mind, the dog started moving in a humping motion, and I felt my pussy being poked at with something stiff. I glanced down and my eyes widened at the sight of the dog&#39;s fully erect, reddened cock probing at my pussy through my bikini. I had never even seen an erect dog before, and couldn&#39;t believe how human-like it looked. Despite myself, my pussy gushed with anticipation." />
