But in her trance, Marki acts on her desire for Jason. This time, Tess wants to share in the same experience. Tess watches Jason service Mom, giving her what she always wants. Jason and Tess, as twins, have a deep connection--and Tess wants more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tess and Mom were sitting up on recliners. Mom, whose name was Marki, was forty-five years old and her 42DD bust was still impressive. She had been working out lately and her abdomen and long legs were becoming more toned all the time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jason looked Mom over. She had always been pretty, despite her concerns about getting older. At five feet, ten inches tall, she needed a lot of sunscreen. The sun shone on her dirty-blonde hair, keeping it naturally bleached. After all, she had taken the kids skinny-dipping all their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tess truly looked like her mom&amp;#39;s daughter. She was even taller, had honey blonde hair, wore a 38DD bra, and her very curvy hourglass shape was fit, as befit a recent college grad who had attended on a volleyball scholarship. Now she was observing Jason with a little smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;On my way, Sis.&amp;quot; With a grin, Jason picked up his replica old-time watch on its chain and walked toward Mom and Tess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mother and daughter were enjoying the view without embarrassmentno reason for them to be embarrassed, given that they were both nude, too. After all, they were both eyeing him as he approached.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All finished with your swim, hon?&amp;quot; Mom asked, looking up at his face as she rubbed sunblock onto one arm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah. I always feel better after I do a few laps.&amp;quot; He took the sunblock container from her and started putting it on her shoulders. The contact with her skin felt smooth and firm under his hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You like what you see?&amp;quot; Tess teased. She sat up straight, shoulders back, so that her bust was proudly forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure!&amp;quot; Jason grinned and took another looklong and luxuriousat his sister. Then he met her gaze. He intended to match her playfulness, but something in her eyes meant more than that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As his twin, she was like his other half. His grin faded as he lost himself for a moment in her teasing gaze. At the same time, his hands slipped around Mom&amp;#39;s sides, under her arms, to work sunblock onto her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tess&amp;#39;s gaze shifted to his hands and she tried to stifle a little smile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jason had put sunblock and lotion on Mom any number of times, so he was not surprised that she made no objection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tess&amp;#39;s eyes followed the movements of his hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gazing at Tess, Jason massaged and kneaded Mom. The combination of watching his sister and feeling Mom in his hands sent adrenaline running through him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom laughed gently. &amp;quot;Not that I mind, but I think you&amp;#39;ve done a complete job on these.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tess giggled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still not embarrassed, Jason put more sunblock on his hands and slipped them along the sides of Mom&amp;#39;s torso, then forward to her abdomen. Her body was warm from the sun and her skin smooth, barely wrinkled or lined. Then he breathed deeply and thought about Mom&amp;#39;s hypnosis session. It was time." />
