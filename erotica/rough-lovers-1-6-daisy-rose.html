&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I have... something to confess,&amp;quot; he said, clenching his hand to fists as we sat side by side on the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was not the first time on his bed, but it was the first time that we were going to bring things to the next level. &amp;quot;Something fun?&amp;quot; I teased, trying to lighten the mood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;#39;t even crack a smile. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I took a woman to bed,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stared at him for a moment and tried to imagine him in bed. I&amp;#39;d felt the muscles under his shirt. &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; I asked, willing my mind to stop straying to imagining him naked. Too late. He was so incredibly hot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I had- have kinks. I just... if you ever find that I&amp;#39;m being too rough, you just need to let me know,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart skipped a beat. I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to look him in the eye. &amp;quot;What kind of fetishes?&amp;quot; I asked, my voice barely a whisper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Domination... humiliation... rough sex...&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; My eyes grew bigger at the end of each word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked like he regretted the words that came out of his mouth the moment he said it. Excitement bubbled up in my stomach, through my esophagus and I felt my throat tighten painfully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My husband - how weird and satisfying it was to say that, even in my head - stayed completely silent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Look,&amp;quot; he said, as if trying to backpedal. There was a slight shake to his voice that I found completely endearing. He may look like he could break a person in two with his bare hands, but behind closed doors, he was the gentlest man I knew. I had been so wrong about him. &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have to- I mean. Forget I said anything...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could kick myself. My hand slid over his and I looked at him, the desperate need in my belly wriggling back from deep slumber, where I had hidden it for the longest time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I just- I&amp;#39;m sorry I said anything,&amp;quot; he said abruptly. &amp;quot;Pretend this conversation never happened.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I blurted louder than I intended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are- are you serious?&amp;quot; I stuttered. &amp;quot;About what you want in bed?&amp;quot;" />
