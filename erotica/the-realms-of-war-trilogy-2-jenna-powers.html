  <title>The Realms of War Trilogy 2 - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Elves of Erun continue their journey towards possible safety up north. Leila, Aewyn and Ariel continue to encounter the strangest of creatures as the Elves try to survive. The secret to the goblin aphrodisiac is revealed as Ariel meets the source of the potion. The lust potion continues to capture them. This trilogy bundles the Realms of War 4, The Realms of War 5 and The Realms of War 6.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Realms of War 4: A House of Glass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As an army of Elves head overseas and another head out to meet with a convy, Meriel notices her mother acting strange. After following her, she comes to find that her mother&amp;#39;s strange actions lead to ogres invading the castle! The ogres overwhelm the castle and the female Elves end up being their sex toys. Meriel watches the events unfold and ends up in the cluthes of horny ogres and trolls...&lt;br /&gt;
Warning! This 10,139 word explicit story contains fantasy sex with multiple trolls and an elf princess and queen. This story includes oral sex, anal sex, double penetration and triple penetration. Meriel is powerless as she&amp;#39;s taken by trolls, and her mother, the queen, doesn&amp;#39;t fare any better with ogres. The realms of war takes off with the fall of Erun.&lt;br /&gt;
It is highly recommended that the Realms of War Trilogy 1 be read prior to reading A House of Glass but not required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Realms of War 5: The Call of Krakenos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During a small break, the Elven High Priestess, Ariel was captured by trolls, who had their way with her. As her allies arrived, she was taken deep inside a dark, mystical cave. When she awakes, she finds herself naked and the mythical, ancient, beast, known as the Krakenos is waiting for her. His powerful secretions make Ariel extremely vulnerable. Does she survive the encounter with the beast?&lt;br /&gt;
Warning! This explicit story contains fantasy sex with a female Elven High Priestess and a tentacle covered beast known as the Krakenos. This story includes oral sex, anal sex, double penetration and triple penetration. Ariel has quite the sticky situation on her hands!&lt;br /&gt;
It is highly recommended that The Realms of War Trilogy 1 and The Realms of War 4 be read prior to reading The Call of Krakenos but not required.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Realms of War 6: The Lich King Rises&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Elves manage to reach the frozen castle of Winterhall and tour the castle alongside their Dwarven allies and feel an ominous presence. As the cold winter night creeps upon them, sentries goes missing and Leila is knocked out. When Leila awakes, she&amp;#39;s tied to a wall, and her fellow Elves surrounded by beasts. Can Leila, Aewyn and Ariel make it through their ordeal with the Lich King&amp;#39;s army?&lt;br /&gt;
Warning! This explicit story contains fantasy sex with a female Elf and a Werewolf and a Frost Giant. This story includes oral sex, anal sex, double penetration and triple penetration. The Lich King rises for the Elves!&lt;br /&gt;
It is highly recommended that The Realms of War Trilogy 1 and The Realms of War 4 and 5 be read prior to reading The Lich King Rises but not required." />
