  <title>That Sort of Thing - Jack Stratton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of a woman named Valentine who meets a charming writer of risqu&amp;eacute; stories. As she is seduced by his words she is also confronted by the guilt of playing his taboo games. Will reality live up to the dirty fantasies?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You mentioned the story about the blonde,&amp;rdquo; he said, with his eyes on her legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His gaze made her feel sexy. She sipped the bourbon and winced a little as it burned in her throat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Right. I think it was one of your earlier stories. There was a man and a blonde girl. She was younger than him. They were in a restaurant and he was telling her what to do,&amp;rdquo; she said, trying not to look at him so that she could speak without being embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What did he tell her to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took another sip, for courage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He told her to pull up her skirt when the waiter wasn&amp;rsquo;t near,&amp;rdquo; she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And touch herself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled again. She wanted his hands on her, like in the cab. She wanted him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Pull up your skirt,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She scoffed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not one of the girls in your stories,&amp;rdquo; she said with a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;" />
