  <title>Cuckold&#39;s Chosen Path - J.C. Wittol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nick and Nicole are the quintessential suburban couple: great jobs, two fantastic kids, and successful careers. Bored with their safe, predictable lives, they embark on a relationship with Collin, a wealthy, gorgeous executive.
Collin and Nicole are perfect together. An overwhelming lust and passion soon defines them. Nick finds himself accepting the role of Cuckold Husband, and he becomes addicted to watching the sexy couple. When Collin and Nicole decide to spend time alone, Nick struggles to deal with being excluded from their relationship.
As Collin assumes a dominant role, he starts making demands. First among them, is to remove her wedding rings. Nick objects, leaving Nicole in the middle, and the explosive argument that follows could endanger their budding relationship.
Cuckold’s Chosen Path is the continuing story of Nick and Nicole, and their choice to take the path less traveled.
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
My body sank onto the bed, as my mind tried to make sense of everything. I’d gone from sitting alone in the hotel lobby, tortured by my imagination, to listening to Collin calmly dissect the entire cuckold/hotwife relationship dynamic. Now I found myself alone again, dismissed by the horny couple, and once again being water-boarded by my vivid imagination.
To say we’d covered some serious ground tonight would a severe understatement, and I struggled to bring it all into focus. I could almost hear my heart beating, and adrenaline still coursed through my system. My hand absently wiped the sweat from my brow. A logical person by nature, I tried to collect my thoughts.
I failed miserably.
A confused, conflicted, and excited cuckold husband, it summarized my situation perfectly.
So much to this lifestyle appealed to me, so much that I enjoyed, but I still struggled with the loss of control. That was the problem. I’d lost the ability to control the outcome, and truthfully, I didn’t have much influence either. I’d even lost control over my own lust. I felt perpetually excited around them, and that, most of all, worried me.
I didn’t want to admit to Collin and Nicole that I loved watching them. I sure as hell didn’t want to admit that I found masturbating to visions and memories of them together more satisfying than having sex with Nicole myself. The consequences of those admissions were incomprehensible. As I mentioned before, I’m an analytical person, process oriented and all that stuff, and as I lay on the bed sifting through my emotions, I realized my biggest emotion wasn’t lust or excitement.
It was fear.
Fear for my marriage.
Fear for my masculinity.
Fear of an unknown future.
Decision time.
I took a deep breath and held it. I wanted to hold Nicole, kiss her, and fall asleep with her in my arms. I also considered throwing her on the bed and having my way with her. She’d let me, I knew she would, and I could reclaim her as mine. Maybe I’d even insist this relationship stop, and we’d resume our normal suburban marriage.
Normal. Safe. Boring.
A black and white future, and after experiencing the vivid colors of a cuckold relationship, I couldn’t accept that future. I’d take the emotional highs and lows, and the constant vacillating between fear and lust, over a safe, boring future.
I believed Nicole when she said she would stay with me; however, I knew she really wanted to spend the night with her boyfriend. She’d stay with me because she felt obligated, not because she really wanted to be with me, and that felt wrong on multiple levels. I realized I couldn’t ask her to stay, I couldn’t deny her the pleasure she got from her new relationship. I signed up for this “boyfriend” situation and understood the risks. I might have underestimated the effect it would have on me, but that wasn’t Nicole’s issue to deal with, it was mine. We’d only been in this relationship for a short time, but I knew what I wanted, what I needed.
I made my choice." />
