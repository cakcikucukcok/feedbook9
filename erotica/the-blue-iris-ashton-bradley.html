  <title>The Blue Iris - Ashton Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the world of the dammed, the forgotten, the left behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born into a world condemned by Lucifer and without God, Ainsley is traumatized, afraid, and hunted. Her life is an unending storm of sorrow, fear, and grief, and its almost more than her eighteen-year-old soul can bear. Orphaned at six, she has every excuse to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is also the last human alive, and her experience is about to become even more incomprehensible. She meets an angel named Gabriel, one of the most loyal angels in Gods army. When he meets Ainsley, his heart breaks for her suffering. Unable to bend to his Fathers will, Gabriel finds himself falling in love with Ainsley. He is willing to sacrifice anything and everything for her, even if the cost is his soul. Condemned to earth for his disobedience, he is exposed to carnal nature for the first time in his eternal existence. Subjected to desire, lust, and hunger, the fallen angel not only has to protect his love from demons, he also has to protect her from himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lucifer also desires the young woman for his own selfish, prurient needs. As the sole female human in existence, Ainsley is the only one capable of producing his unholy heir. For this reason, he will stop at nothing to obtain her for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;But God has an agenda of his own as well &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
