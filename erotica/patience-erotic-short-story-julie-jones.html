  <title>Patience - erotic short story - Julie Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I‘m going to let you fuck me now, Max. Be gentle, be slow, make it last&quot;
Max Campbell is used to having things his way. Eddie Patterson is used to giving it to him. Lovers and ex colleagues, Max and Eddie are no strangers to a stolen touch or a frantic shag in the company bathrooms. That was, until Eddie decided to sell his shares and leave town. Horny and tired of wanking alone and having meaningless one-night stands, Max jumps in the car to go see his old friend, desperate to have his way with him.
But Eddie has other plans. He‘s going to make Max work for it. Hard. But with a little bit of patience, it might just be worth the wait...
