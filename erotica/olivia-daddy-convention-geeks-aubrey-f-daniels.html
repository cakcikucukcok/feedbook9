  <title>Olivia &amp; Daddy: Convention Geeks - Aubrey F. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Olivia is adjusting to her new life with her Daddy. Finally getting to spend quality time together, they take a holiday to a Convention together, enjoying cosplay and each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Olivia took a deep breath and slowed her fingers down to simple exploratory movements. Probing around herself and feeling everything. Enjoying the moment before at last, she stopped altogether. She rose from the bed, nude, did not bother with putting any clothing on but instead began to first lay out Daddy&amp;rsquo;s costume and clothing for the day. She made sure his hygiene supplies were where they were supposed to be and he had a fresh towel and wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the short week, they had begun their special relationship, she learned how he likes his morning coffee. The maker in the room was not as sophisticated as the one in their home, but it would do. It was a Keurig coffee maker, and upon seeing the flavors available she had a wonderful idea to really start his morning right. Quietly taking the phone into the bathroom she made the call, knowing she was causing herself more torture but knowing how much it would please him, and after all, isn&amp;rsquo;t that where she received her true satisfaction?" />
