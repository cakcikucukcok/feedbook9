  <title>Little Secrets - Catherine LaCroix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After two hot and steamy weeks spent in the care of his mysterious new lover Lilith, Tristan wonders about her motives and his future. Being offered every comfort and luxury he could ever imagine in her abode only serves to raise more questions. His curiosity starts innocently enough, but the secrets he uncovers will change their relationship forever.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
The heat that Tristan was now intimately familiar with blanketed the room as he opened his eyes. How long had he been there? How long did he intend to stay?
“Hello there, little love.” Lilith lay at his side, clad loosely in the black, silk bathrobe she favored so much. “Did you sleep well?”
“Always,” he smiled. But his throat was dry and it was hard to keep his eyes open. Yet Lilith still remained seemingly untouched by the overwhelming temperature. Despite his nudity, sweat covered his body.
“You’re adorable when you’re asleep. Sometimes you talk when you dream, but most times you cuddle.” She brushed a perfectly manicured hand through his hair and caressed his face.
“I wish I could say how you are when you sleep.” Not once had he ever awoken to see her sleeping beside him.
“I’ve had a long time to learn how to go about my day without much rest,” she grinned, her ivory teeth and devious smile insinuating things that made him shiver. Her hands moved to his waist and she pulled him closer. “You have so many things on your mind for someone waking up with a scantily clad woman beside them.”
Her skin was like a magnet to his fingers; he had to touch it, to feel it. He stroked her throat, letting his hand wander. The sweet smell of her drove him crazy. Despite his urges, he pushed them back for a few moments, trying to concentrate on the questions that gnawed at him.
“Lilith, how long have I been here?”
She bit her lip and tilted her head to the side; a cautious look that said she didn’t want to tell him. The simple gesture made his heart skip a beat and he wanted to kiss it off of her face.
“Two weeks?” Lilith replied quietly—almost a question. Her hand went to his shoulder.
“Two…weeks…” He rubbed his temples with his palms. Every time they’d shared an intimate moment together, he’d wanted nothing more than to stay here with her, wherever this was.
But that was just it, he barely knew her still—the only real secrets she shared were physical. She continuously promised him the world and anything he even suggested he missed or wanted always appeared for him the next time he ventured into the living room—generally after he’d slept for some time. Including all of his things he’d left at home. Despite him only giving her a general idea of where he once lived.
“Tristan?” She tipped her head toward him, her forehead touching his. “Are you mad at me?”
“No…no that’s not it.” Her lips drew him in and he found his against hers before he could stop it. Even after two weeks of exploring her, memorizing her, every time they touched it sparked a lust in him he’d never felt before." />
