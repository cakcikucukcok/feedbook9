  <title>Caught Exhibitionist - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jasmine isn&amp;#39;t half as innocent as she looks. She&amp;#39;s a shy swimming instructor by morning and a daredevil exhibitionist by night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lost in the middle of a town he knows nothing about, Tyler is relieved when he sees a young woman in the middle of the road. He approaches her quietly and stops just as he was going to make his presence known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She- she is taking her clothes off...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every warning light programmed into her subconscious mind went off, the ones that protected her from making horrible mistakes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her fight or flight response kicked in and it took everything in her to keep her feet planted on the floor and not turn around and pretend she didn&amp;#39;t see him. She blinked repeatedly, hoping against all odds that he was just a hallucination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She held her dress close to her body even though it did little to hide the fact that she was naked and had been pleasuring herself just moments earlier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He had seen everything. She was sure of it. The look in his eyes was one that she had seen before. Jason had the very same look when he saw her in the library and took her for the first time. He looked like he was ready to devour her whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The strange man who appeared out of nowhere was undoubtedly handsome. She had this strange feeling that she had seen him before. His hair was braided intricately to form neat cornrows that disappeared into a tightly braided ponytail and his eyes were emeralds that stared straight into her soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His cheekbones were pronounced and perfect. Down his muscular neck was an equally muscular body, hidden beneath a well-tailored white shirt that clung to him into the darkness. He looked like a professional sports athlete attending a press conference. He had the height of one, that much was certain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes moved further downwards and her cheeks flamed red. She focused her eyes back onto his face. How could a guy be so gorgeous? Everything about him screamed masculinity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was average height but she needed to strain her neck to look up into his face. He looked terrifying in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stayed rooted in spot as he approached her. The more she looked at him, the more familiar he looked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hello, gorgeous,&amp;quot; he said as he reached her, his hand moving forward to wrap around her waist. It was like he had known her for years. But she hadn&amp;#39;t seen him before. This was the first time they&amp;#39;d met.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;H-hey,&amp;quot; she managed to stutter out, knowing that her cheeks were redder than roses. Her dress clung hopelessly to her body and she knew it was hopeless to try and explain anything to him. Was there anything to explain? Maybe he would spare her the embarrassment and pretend he hadn&amp;#39;t seen anything?" />
