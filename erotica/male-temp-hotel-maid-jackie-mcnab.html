  <title>Male Temp: Hotel Maid - Jackie Mcnab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After being laid off for months, Joe and Jen are about to lose everything if they can&amp;#39;t make the minimum payments in just a few weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are excited to be given temp jobs at a nearby hotel, but Joe is a little perplexed that they have requested him as a hotel maid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He starts to understand why he&amp;#39;s been chosen when he finds out his uniform is a pair of sheer women&amp;#39;s panties and he will be working for a small group of hot men in a private presidential suite, with his wife watching. Both of them find this entirely new experience mortifying, but secretly exciting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At first, Joe is paralyzed with fear at the thought of cleaning a hotel suite in ladies panties while being watched but is even more humiliated when his wife gets busy with two men in front of him while he cleans. His humiliation soon turns to excitement as the day of work unfolds, especially when he sees the surprise his gorgeous female boss has for him in between her legs!" />
