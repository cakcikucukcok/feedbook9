  <title>Club Bar - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sally&#39;s lucrative new job in the private bar is to serve the billionaire gang of customers in every way imaginable.
She is humiliated when the men quickly take and fill her for the first time, right there in the bar. Soon, she is yearning for the large, well-hung members of the club, all intent on emptying their loads into her.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;Aren&#39;t you a little too young for this job?&quot; Edward Jones said, looking at me with those same mesmerizing eyes that had drawn me to the bar in the first place.
This was the first time he had talked to me and I was awestruck. His jaw line was even more pronounced up close and his shoulders were broad and manly. Clear hazel eyes glared down at me, making our height difference even more pronounced. I was wearing high heels and even that didn&#39;t add to my height enough. He towered over me like an angry god of some sort.
I looked up at him blankly, my mind not making the right connections of synapses to be able to come up with a clever response. Or any response for that matter...
&quot;You have been briefed, yes?&quot; he asked when I continued staring dumbly at him.
&quot;Briefed?&quot; I echoed nervously, feeling goose bumps appear on my arms as I thought about the odd call I answered just an hour ago. The woman that they had hired to appear was a no-show and I was called in at the last minute.
&quot;Yes. Have anyone told you what you&#39;re supposed to do?&quot; he asked impatiently, tapping his steel-toed boots against the wooden floor.
I felt like an idiot, but all I could think of was how incredibly handsome he looked in his leather jacket. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been briefed,&quot; I shook my head. &quot;Samantha, the girl who was supposed to come-&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re not Samantha?&quot; he said in a accusing tone that made my eyes fill up with nervous tears.
Get a grip of yourself. You&#39;re eighteen, not twelve!
&quot;I&#39;m Sally, Sir,&quot; I said, extending a hand in front of me.
&quot;Well, Sally. I hope my idiot of a manager told you what you&#39;re supposed to do. I don&#39;t want you running off like Samantha too,&quot; he said.
I felt an instant need not to let him down and nodded eagerly. &quot;I&#39;m ready to do whatever it takes, Sir.&quot;
The corner of his lips curved up into a half-grin, half-snarl and I felt warmed all the way through. &quot;I like that attitude. Have a seat,&quot; he offered, pulling out a chair for me.
