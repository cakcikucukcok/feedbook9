  <title>Mediplex - Mediplex Story No.1 - Morgan Destera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mediplex is an ongoing serialization, the story of one family&amp;#39;s journey through a sexual utopia. After a mutable disease reshapes society, the family seeks shelter at the Mediplex, hoping for relief and hoping their own oddities may help others. There are only two rules in the Mediplex - consent is a must, and abuse is forbidden. How easy will it be for the adults to overcome the social mores they grew up with? And how kinky can the Admin be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dammit!&amp;rdquo; he yelled, almost crying. &amp;ldquo;You know what my problem is! Why make it so humiliating?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria put the thermometer on the tray and approached him. He stood his ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I have to act in the way I was ordered to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;d that damned virus. Dad may have been cured, but I was born after it all started. It affected him worse than we thought. Yes, I&amp;#39;m intersexed. And yes they are both fully functioning. And now at my age I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria leaned over and hugged the boy. She stayed at his level so he could see down the front of her blouse at the ample cleavage. He reached for it, like a child reaches for a security blanket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How old are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You already know that. That&amp;#39;s all in the paperwork you took earlier. I&amp;#39;m 18.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hands slipped inside her blouse and found she had no bra hampering him. His fingers squeezed her flesh and thumbs grazed her nipples.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yet you look so much younger. It&amp;#39;s The Pitting. It can cause developmental issues. But you&amp;#39;re the first intersexed we&amp;#39;ve seen with that abnormality. Physically, your mind is 18, but your body is about 11, I&amp;#39;d say. Developmentally, you are just a raging bag of hormones,&amp;rdquo; she cooed. She removed his hand from her breasts and led him back to the table. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;#39;t know what part of yourself to follow. Your cock says let me in. Your breasts say suckle me. Your pussy gets wet and aching. Poor boy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria unbuttoned and slipped off her blouse. &amp;ldquo;It may be a bit too early to tell, but when you look at me, what do you want to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris swallowed hard. &amp;ldquo;I &amp;ndash; I want to suck your breasts. I want to be held.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And your penis?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris glanced down. It was semi-hard but not aching. But his vagina was sending signals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria leaned over him. His pants were still down. She took his small penis into her hand, rubbing it lightly but thoroughly. As it started to come to life in her hand, she drew it into her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris&amp;#39;s head went back and his eyes closed. Never had he felt anything so moist and exquisite as her mouth on his dick. He could feel her tongue swirling around it. He could feel the suction, egging the flesh to life. Then her mouth moved up and down slowly on his shaft, the faster. He thought he would never ever feel anything as good ever again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ohhhh,&amp;rdquo; he moaned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria&amp;#39;s other hand reached up to caress one of the boy&amp;#39;s &amp;ndash; but was he really a boy? &amp;ndash; small breasts, then the other. What she would give to have the equipment this man had! To be able to experience every possible sensation. Her own pussy quivered at the thought." />
