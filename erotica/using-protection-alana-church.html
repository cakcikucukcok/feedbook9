&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think we should talk,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;d rather not,&amp;rdquo; she said, her eyes promising...what?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nicole...&amp;rdquo; he sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp;ldquo;I thought about it all day at work. I&amp;#39;m not going to hide it and I&amp;#39;m not going to fight it any longer, Patrick. I want you. I want you in my bed, as my lover.&amp;rdquo; She placed a hand on her belly. &amp;ldquo;I want you inside me, as my lover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And Danny?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;Your friends? The firm? What will we do about that? Some people,&amp;rdquo; he said, understating the case tremendously, &amp;ldquo;might not approve.&amp;rdquo; In St. Louis, the stands erupted as the Cardinals hit another home run.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If we got married, sure,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t think there is any way we could make that work. Not without leaving town and starting over where no one knew us. But there are hundreds, thousands of people in this city who are intimate without being married. There is no reason not to be lovers as long as we keep it quiet. And if things work out between us, one day, when Danny is old enough to understand, we&amp;#39;ll tell him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But why should we deny ourselves the chance for happiness when it is right here in front of us? Pat, do you love me? Do you want me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good God, yes,&amp;rdquo; he said hoarsely, his voice strained with emotion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And I want you,&amp;rdquo; she replied. She rose up and straddled him. Behind them, her phone buzzed on the counter. They both ignored it. Slowly, she lowered her lips to his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They made out for what seemed like hours, a slow, gentle series of kisses that brought them to a fevered pitch of excitement. Nicole was in no hurry, savoring the slow rise of desire, and Patrick had no need to push her. He cupped her buttocks in his hands, his fingers teasing at the hem of her shorts, the tips tickling the inside of her thighs. She giggled as her skin quivered, her mouth open wide, her tongue darting into his mouth to wrestle with his. Slow and sensual, she pushed her breasts against his chest, purring deep in her throat as his hands rose up to undo the buttons of her shirt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feather-light, his hands brushed across her lace-covered glories and he dropped his face to nuzzle the delicate skin of her chest. Groaning, she rocked against him, grinding her aching sex on his hot shaft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He winced and pulled away slightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you keep that up,&amp;rdquo; he warned her, &amp;ldquo;I am going to be too raw to do you any good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, we can&amp;#39;t have that, can we?&amp;rdquo; she said. She curled a hand around his length, softly stroking. &amp;ldquo;Maybe we should get all of these stupid clothes off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was just unclasping her bra when there was a tremendous crash at the door. Nicole jerked up, her face draining, staring towards the front hall like a scared rabbit. Holding her shirt across her chest, she ran for her phone. Reading what it said, she whimpered in fear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I&amp;#39;m coming over, bitch. U better be ready for me if u know whats good for u.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He&amp;#39;s here,&amp;rdquo; she gasped as another blow shook the doorframe." />
