  <title>Brittany Loves Daddy - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy, can you come help me for a second?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Sure baby, be there in a minute.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s how it all started. My daughter had just turned 18 a week ago and was getting ready to go to school, she was a senior in high school this year. She is very beautiful with long dark hair and green eyes, nice athletic body with curves in all the right places. Long smooth legs and a perky chest make her a much looked at girl.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;ldquo;Daddy, can you come help me for a second?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure baby, be there in a minute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s how it all started. My daughter had just turned 18 a week ago and was getting ready to go to school, she was a senior in high school this year. She is very beautiful with long dark hair and green eyes, nice athletic body with curves in all the right places. Long smooth legs and a perky chest make her a much looked at girl. I even look at her &amp;lsquo;in that way&amp;rsquo; sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I left my wife a few years back. My daughter had decided to stay with me. We had a close relationship and I treated her like a queen while her mom was always badgering and complaining about this or that. So, much to my ex&amp;rsquo;s dismay, our daughter Brittany had told her she would be staying with me. I remember that day and I smile all the time about it. We hugged and had a great dinner out that night. We were like a couple, except for the sex part.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brittany would walk around the house in her little nighties all the time. Either that or her cute white nightshirt, which seemed to get shorter every year. This morning had been no different. I woke up and went to the kitchen and saw Brittany standing by the counter in her nightshirt that came just below her cute little but cheeks. I noticed her smooth long legs immediately and walked up behind her giving her a little kiss on the shoulder saying, &amp;ldquo;Good morning sweetie pie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good morning daddy, did you sleep well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well as I could, it was a little cold last night.&amp;rdquo; I mumbled&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy! you should have come and got me, we could have snuggled up together to keep warm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a good idea, to bad I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of it last night. Besides, it might look a little strange for a dad to be sleeping in the same bed with his 18-year-old daughter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Who would see? We are the only ones here dad, so next time just come and get me ok? It&amp;rsquo;s no big deal, we snuggle on the couch all the time watching TV at night.&amp;rdquo; She had a point, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between snuggling on the couch and snuggling on the bed &amp;hellip;. hmmmm. Well, I guess there is a little difference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She went up to get ready for school as I finished my breakfast. Her words were burning through my mind. Did she just ask me to let her sleep with me? I was absently turning the pages of the newspaper thinking about our conversation, probably reading too much into it when I heard her calling me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy, can you come help me for a second?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure baby, be there in a minute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was walking up the stairs in my morning robe, smelling the sweet-scented perfume in the air. She always smelled so good, sometimes I would run my nose along her neckline sniffing in her sweet aroma. She would giggle and give me a hug. I walked to her room, the door was open and I peeked in.&lt;br /&gt;
