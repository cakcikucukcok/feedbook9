  <title>The Way of a Man with a Maid - Anonymous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;She&#39;s your maid, and so-to-speak your property, dear,&quot; I replied softly, &quot;so arrange matters just as you like. I&#39;ll leave it all to you and won&#39;t interfere unless you want me to do anything.&quot;
She kissed me gratefully, then turned her eyes on Fanny, who during this whispered conference had been standing trembling, her face still hidden from us, her legs pressed closely against each other as if to shield her cunt as much as possible from our sight.
I saw Alice&#39;s eyes wander over Fanny&#39;s naked body with evident pleasure, dwelling first on her magnificent lines and curves, then on her lovely breasts, and finally on the mass of dark curling moss-like hair that covered her cunt.
