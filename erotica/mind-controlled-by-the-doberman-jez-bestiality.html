      <meta name="description" content="What was going on? Why was I hearing my Doberman&amp;rsquo;s thoughts in my head? Why was I&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh God! This is sick! Wrong! Filthy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Still, I obeyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Come to me. Atlas&amp;#39;s thoughts sang through Stella&amp;#39;s dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without waking, the young 19-year-old woman slipped from her bed, leaving her slumbering boyfriend and padded downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Atlas, the large doberman, waited in his crate, knowing she&amp;#39;d come. When she entered the kitchen in only her see through nightie, he smiled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dutifully, she opened his crate and lowered her head, greeting her lord and master.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled. Good girl. He strutted out of the dog kennel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;d finally taken control of her mind. No longer would he have to sleep in the kennel or go to obedience school. She was his bitch now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiss me. He ordered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her long, slender fingers brushed over his face, then she pressed her lips against his, peppering his muzzle with searing, hot passionate kisses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stella tickled his chest with her long fingernails. He groaned and tapped his paw on the kitchen floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you want, master?&amp;quot; Her scalding breath washed down his ear, sending tingles through his powerful frame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why do you think I called you, my bitch?" />
