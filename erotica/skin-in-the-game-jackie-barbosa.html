  <title>Skin in the Game - Jackie Barbosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angela Peterson was always the quiet, shy kid growing up in Harper Falls, crushing on the high school quarterback and honing her football strategy skills. Now grown up and coaching the high school team, she&#39;s shocked when that same sexy quarterback returns to Harper Falls, asks her back to his hotel room...and then tries to steal her job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Injured NFL quarterback Cade Reynolds is in Harper Falls to take over as interim head coach, and he never thought the tall, blond bombshell he propositioned would offer up any resistance. Not to a repeat of the amazingly wild night they shared and certainly not to his coaching position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Harper Falls High Eagles are Angie&#39;s team, and even the hometown hero won&#39;t take that away from her, no matter how hot he is. As the two engage in a battle of wits and wills, this is one game neither is prepared to lose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
