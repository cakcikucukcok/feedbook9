  <title>Down There - William Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is cheating congenital?
Thats the question plaguing William Wilson, a courtroom lawyer, as he tries to escape The Syndrome. But just one more delicious fling
Bad decision, for now he finds himself faced with a ruinous personal injury law suit being brought against him by a young white woman half his age claiming mutilating personal damages from their brief bathroom tryst. Is she playing the race card in reverse?
Its not helpful that Wilsons marriage has already been plagued by the color consciousness of his light-skin wifes family and friends. Its not helpful that his rich mother-in-law has vowed to bust up the marriage for the sake of her own bloodline and her grandchildrens skin. And hair
As the forces of sex, class and color wage ruthlessly against his career and family, against his lifestyle and sanity, the one person he can call upon for the answer, and for deliverance, is ironically stalking him.
Authentically rendered, Down There is a morally and politically brave excursion into human obsession." />
