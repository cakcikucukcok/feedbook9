  <title>The Lady Disk Jockey (Annotated) - Carl Van Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This vintage adult paperback presents lurid themes from the bygone era of the 1970&amp;rsquo;s which emphasized the human sexuality movement, erotic literature, &amp;quot;under-the-counter&amp;quot; culture, and mass media markets aimed at mature audiences. In this book, Sally Sue Bennett is a victim of immoral men&amp;hellip; and as an innocent victim has no choice but obey. Is the story sad because she finds herself caught in a web of depravity and perversion she never dreamed existed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Honey, honey&amp;hellip; Darling&amp;hellip; try to be gentle?&amp;quot; she begged even as she felt the smooth rubbery head pressing relentlessly against her tight, resisting hymen. Sally Sue wished fervently that with one lunge he would enter her, would end the agony of suspense as her maidenhead was torn away and her virgin blood flowed through the wide-stretched trembling flesh of her ass-cheeks to soak the sheet below her sweating body. She strained up to the thick shaft of throbbing flesh, but nothing seemed to help. His penis was just too big!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Christ, you&amp;#39;re tight!&amp;quot; Bob gasped as his tall lean body hovered above her slender nakedness and her arms gripped him tightly. Again and again his long rigid cock prodded and probed, without breaching the barrier, until he said, &amp;quot;Say now, Sally Sue, I know a way to fix the trouble. You&amp;#39;re juicy enough&amp;ndash;I never felt a wetter pussy in my life. But I&amp;#39;m dry! If I was wet and slick too, it might go in like a dream. How about wetting me up?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; the girl said in all innocence, her mind trying to ride over the hurt she&amp;#39;d momentarily felt when he blurted out about knowing how other girls got wet and ready for him. Well, she reasoned, her new husband was so excited, she would have to forgive him, but sometime she&amp;#39;d ask him not to use words like that to her. She could not imagine just what he had in mind. Surely he didn&amp;#39;t want to release her from his intimate clutches and have her go into the bathroom and get a glass of water and wet his rampant penis! &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t understand, Bob&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Take it in your mouth for a couple of minutes&amp;hellip; make it slick. Your mouth is enough to give a mummy a hard on!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my God! Sally Sue thought in horror. How could he ever suggest such a vile thing&amp;ndash;opening her mouth to his male flesh! It was unspeakably filthy! She was so shocked that all desire left her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll try to forget you ever said such a thing,&amp;quot; she groaned. She stirred, her body sinuously undulating beneath him, and she felt the smooth, knoblike head of his cock pressing through her tender vaginal lips. &amp;quot;Do it to me! I don&amp;#39;t care how much it hurts anymore! Just do it!!&amp;quot;" />
