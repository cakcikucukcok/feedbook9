  <title>Neighborly Tryst - Bill Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roxanne is very unsatisfied with her marriage. She has nothing in common with her husband and their sex life is less than thrilling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she and her husband overhear their new neighbor having a wild night, Roxanne becomes determined to find out how to get that type of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a typical Friday night for Roxanne and Danny. The young married couple who have been sweethearts since high school both get home from work, shower, get dressed, and go to dinner. The pair arrives at their favorite restaurant and orders their usual meals. A large salad is soon placed in front of Roxanne and plate of pasta is set in front of Danny. Roxanne tells Danny about her day and then he does the same. The conversation is light. Not much is new in the lives of the young couple. The meal ends and they proceed to the movie theater for a show. They hold hands during the film and discuss their individual likes and dislikes of the movie during the car ride home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is late when they arrive home to their small apartment. Each spends some time in the bathroom preparing for bed. A single lamp on a bedside table illuminates the room. Danny&amp;#39;s thin body is covered only by a pair of boxer shorts as he lay in bed waiting for Roxanne. She enters the room soon after wearing one of his old t-shirts and white pair of panties. Danny&amp;#39;s eyes move up and down Roxanne&amp;#39;s 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot; body as she walks toward the bed. Her slightly curled brown hair reaches all the way to her mid-back. Her green eyes sparkle in the dim light. Her 32DD breasts threaten to tear through the tiny shirt she is wearing.&amp;nbsp; He smiles at her, knowing how lucky he is to have her." />
