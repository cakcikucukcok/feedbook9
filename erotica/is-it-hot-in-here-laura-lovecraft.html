  <title>Is It Hot In Here? - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All week Miranda&amp;#39;s looked forward to going out on Saturday night pick up a hot young stud, but when the thermostat breaks she&amp;#39;s stuck waiting for maintenance. Sitting there alone and sweating, Miranda isn&amp;#39;t happy. That changes when she sees Chris, the hot young maintenance man. Chris has his work cut out for him when Miranda decides she&amp;#39;d rather heat up than cool down!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I want you to rub my feet.&amp;quot; Miranda smiled at the way he froze with his hand in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What did you say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You heard me.&amp;quot; She stretched out her leg and wiggled her purple toes at him. &amp;quot;My feet are sore and you have such nice strong hands.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ma&amp;#39;am, I mean Miss...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Miranda.&amp;quot; She slid her foot down his leg and he jumped when she worked her foot up under his jeans high enough to touch his bare leg over his sock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Say my name.&amp;quot; Her smile was gone and she focused her intense gaze on his nervous one. &amp;quot;I want to hear you say it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Miranda, I don&amp;#39;t think that would be appropriate.&amp;quot; He stepped back out of reach of her foot, and zipping up his bag, picked it up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Chris, am I dressed like a woman who cares about being appropriate?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, but you were going out. I work here and you live here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just means we can cut right to the fun and we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about anyone needing to take a cab.&amp;quot; Miranda pointed to him. &amp;quot;Drop the bag and come rub my feet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he didn&amp;#39;t move, she shrugged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Way I see it, Chris is your job is to make sure everything in my apartment that needs tended to is taken care of and right now I have sore feet and something hot and wet that needs taken care of.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wet..oh, goddamn.&amp;quot; Chris whispered, and Miranda held back a laugh when the bag fell to the floor from his suddenly loose grip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wet, hot and sticky, kind of like the rest of me.&amp;quot; Miranda, slowly licked her lips. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been told it&amp;#39;s pretty sweet too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re screwing with me aren&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; Miranda could hear the nervous tremble in his voice and his face was beet red and she doubted it was the temperature in the room. &amp;quot;I could lose my job if I say yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Only if I told on you.&amp;quot; Miranda sighed. &amp;quot;But if you leave me here with my issues untended too, I might have to report you for not doing your job.&amp;quot;" />
