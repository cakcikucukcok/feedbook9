  <title>Carrie&#39;s Caprice - George Kalabry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Social networking and on-line gaming can be hazardous to your health, even when youre fully clothed. Carries predicament begins when she hooks up with a slick scoundrel. He turns out to be a drug dealer, and that makes him more exciting and desirable to an impressionable sixteen-year-old sophomore. Hungry for thrills and wild with innocence, she dives headlong into a situation she cant control. Her little trolly gets derailed, when she discovers that she is being used as a bargaining chip to satisfy a debt to a sex-starved ex-convict.
	Carries mother goes berserk on finding out that her daughter has become intimate with a college student: On weekends when he comes home from SUNY Brockport, the youngsters engage in a relationship that most married couples would envy. Carrie also seduces two of her teachers to wangle passing grades in their courses." />
