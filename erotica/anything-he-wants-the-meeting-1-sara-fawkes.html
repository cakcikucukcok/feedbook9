  <title>Anything He Wants: The Meeting (#1) - Sara Fawkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She never met a man like him before, a powerful billionaire who &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; gets what he wants.  Now she&#39;s about to enter an exclusive world of glittering opulence and all-consuming passion--where she&#39;ll explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy Delacourt&#39;s office temp position isn&#39;t quite her dream job but it pays the bills...barely. The highlight of her day is riding the elevator in the mornings with a handsome stranger. Tall, dark, and sexy as hell, Lucy knows he&#39;s way out of her league, but a girl can look, right? Everything changes the day the stranger seduces her. Completely out of character, she yields without a fight, but she has no idea her wanton acts with a man whose name she doesn&#39;t know will change her life forever. Because the sexy stranger is none other than Jeremiah Hamilton, billionaire CEO of Hamilton Industries, and one taste isn&#39;t nearly enough to satisfy his need. &lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other installments of the scorching serial novel Anything He Wants: The Contract (Part 2), The Secret (Part 3) and The Rescue (Part 4) and The Betrayal (Part 5) available now!&lt;/p&gt;" />
