  <title>Milk Slave on the Dog Farm - Jade Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jackie is in big trouble when her husband, Mark, finds out she ran up another credit card. He decides to put her to work on their dog farm feeding the dogs the milk they&#39;re hungry for. But the dogs want more than milk when they find her naked and spread wide open for them.
Excerpt:
&quot;You’re going to stay right here and you&#39;re going to feed these dogs until you&#39;ve worked off all of the money you racked up on that credit card.”
“What are you talking about? Feed them what?&quot;
I screamed out as my husband’s fingers pinched both of my nipples. He picked both breasts up again and then let them drop. The pain of the full weight of my breasts suddenly dropping shot through my body. Mark just watched them jiggle and sway for another minute, then stood up.
“You&#39;ll see.&quot;
Mark walked off and in my drugged-up haze I heard him unlock the dog cages. Suddenly I was surrounded by a group of large dogs. They immediately started licking my naked body and it wasn’t long before two of them found my nipples.
I gritted my teeth and screamed out as I felt the dog teeth clamp down around them and suck. I squirmed and wriggled around but I couldn&#39;t move my body out of the humiliating position my husband had put me in. I felt some of the dogs sniff me from behind, then cram their faces into my pussy.
I looked up at my husband, hoping that he would show some mercy and unbuckle the cuffs, but he just smiled down at me while he rubbed the hard bulge in his pants.
Suddenly I felt the milk start to come. I had never been pregnant or breast-fed before, but somehow I knew what was happening. Milk was pulsing through my breasts and was about to gush out of my nipples. I gasped as it exploded out of me and into the dog’s mouths. " />
