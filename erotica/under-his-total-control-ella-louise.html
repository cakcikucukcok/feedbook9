  <title>Under His Total Control - Ella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you fall for someone immediately, how well do you really know that person? That&amp;#39;s what Helen is forced to wonder when she finds herself naked, cuffed to a chair in her new boyfriend&amp;#39;s basement, completely at his mercy. He asked her to try something kinky, but what happens next will completely redefine her views of trust, sex, and love - if she makes it out at all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I met Mike for the first time at the laundromat. Of all the places you can meet strikingly handsome, heart-meltingly gorgeous men, I never suspected the laundromat would have been the place where I met mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To be honest, I never suspected I&amp;rsquo;d meet a man like him at all. But there he was, tossing his athletic shorts into the dryer and casting a grin my way when he heard my cell phone&amp;rsquo;s ringtone go off; I remember being surprised that anyone who looked like that would recognize and appreciate the Star Wars Imperial March.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like fate, he told me on our first date.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But now here I am, manacled in his basement. It&amp;rsquo;s been two hours since he left me here, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to wonder if he&amp;rsquo;ll ever come back. The old fashioned cast iron cuffs are chafing the skin around my wrists and ankles, and the stiff wooden chair is still chilly against my naked skin even after being exposed to my body heat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I breathe deeply and exhale a shaky breath, flexing my fingers to keep the blood flowing. I can&amp;rsquo;t shift much in my seat, but I can wiggle enough to keep my limbs from falling asleep. Of all my current discomfort and humiliation, at least I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with tingles and numbness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Mike and I first made love, it was perfect. I thought so, anyway. We were in my bed, he was on top of me, kissing me, running his hands over my curves to show me he loved my body even if I had been afraid to show it to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I assumed he thought it was perfect, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is why, when he asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d be up for trying something a little kinkier this time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too hard about it before I said yes." />
