  <title>Mom, I Know About You - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What is my mother doing on Thursday nights? Every single Thursday night of the month she dresses to kill and goes out, and she won&amp;#39;t tell me where she&amp;#39;s going or what she&amp;#39;s doing. Well, I&amp;#39;m going to follow her this Thursday and finally find out. I&amp;#39;ve wanted her since I was twelve years old and I&amp;#39;ll be damned if some other man is going to usurp my position as man of the house. No way. When I find out what&amp;#39;s going on, there will be hell to pay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dad died when I was just nine years old and it&amp;rsquo;s been just me and Mom ever since. We are all we need as far as family goes. I should respect her wish for privacy on Thursday nights but I just can&amp;rsquo;t leave it alone. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to know where she goes and who it is she&amp;rsquo;s seeing. It&amp;rsquo;s driving me nuts. It drives me nuts because she&amp;rsquo;s mine, and mine alone. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the way I&amp;rsquo;ve always fantasized about it. I&amp;rsquo;m old enough now, at the age of consent, and I want to seal the deal. I want inside her in the worst way. I want to fuck her until she&amp;rsquo;s raw and screaming my name. To that end, I make plans to follow her on Thursday night. I&amp;rsquo;ll find out what I need to know and then I&amp;rsquo;ll take her away from whoever it is she&amp;rsquo;s fucking. I&amp;rsquo;ll drag her luscious ass out of there and bring her home to show her who the real man in her life is. Me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She would never imagine that I would follow her. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes this so easy. She&amp;rsquo;s headed for a ritzy part of town and then pulls into the driveway of a mansion, the likes of which we would never imagine being able to live in. So, she&amp;rsquo;s got a sugar daddy. Still, I want to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I park on the street and walk along some hedges leading to the front door. She knocks three times and the door is opened by a man in a leather mask&amp;hellip;and not much else. What the fuck? I try to see through the windows but they are too high for me to see much. Then a light comes on in the basement level and I have a clear view. It&amp;rsquo;s a small window and I doubt if the inhabitants ever think to cover it. Good. And there she is&amp;hellip;being fondled by three men, one of whom pushes her to her knees and makes her suck his cock. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to cum in my pants&amp;hellip;or puke, I don&amp;rsquo;t know which." />
