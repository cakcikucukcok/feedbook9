  <title>Bound By Misery - Niki S. Cordell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She thinks she&#39;s living a normal quiet life.  Well, that&#39;s how it started out.   When a young girl witnesses the murder of her father-like figure, she becomes victim to a world of sex and crime.  The killers are after her and once they have her, she is forever in their debt. They can do anything they want to her. After all, she is kidnapped.   But what happens when love gets in the way? When passion takes over. When anger erupts. When the people you love die. When you&#39;re being held against your will by psychotic and sick criminals who will stop at nothing until you&#39;re left alone, cold, and scared until your mind has gone crazy.  Will she make it out alive? Will she even be sane if she does make it out alive?  **This book contains but is not limited to, violent explicit sex scenes, sexual abuse, foul language, torture, abuse, etc. They could be triggers for some. If you are easily offended by any of the listed above, turn back now. You&#39;ve been warned.**" />
