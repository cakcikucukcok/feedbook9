  <title>Shattered Innocence - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pampered, sheltered, and innocent Anna never thought she would be kneeling before her new employer, much less agreeing to do the perverted things he was suggesting.&lt;br /&gt;
Darius thinks her a challenge, someone he can claim, conquer, and ruin&amp;mdash;body and soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What would you like to do first: The room, or me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Excuse me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You heard me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What makes you think I&amp;#39;m going to do anything you say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You will,&amp;quot; he says, sounding so certain of himself that I knew it was only a matter of time before he won.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tell me what you know about apartment four twenty three.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve only been to the apartment once,&amp;quot; she said, looking straight at me. &amp;quot;He was devastating in every way conceivable. Like a film-star, one of those tough outdoor types. He&amp;#39;s handsome and strong, with bronzed skin from all his travelling and lean, clear-cut features. I thought he was black at first, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cause of his name?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she feigned surprise. &amp;quot;Darius could be a Caucasian name.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I rose my eyebrows and stared at her until she broke into a grin.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Alright, it was his name. I found out later that he was on loan from the subsidiary office in South Africa to the main company here&amp;hellip;and that his eyes were blue and he had dark brown hair which waved a bit at the front. He was so dreamy&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; she sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;I know what he looks like,&amp;#39; I wanted to interrupt, but kept myself in check and waited patiently for her to continue.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He came in about half an hour into cleaning. There wasn&amp;#39;t much to clean at all,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Was it the same for you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He has a way of looking at people, the kind of eyes that was either looking through you with arrogant indifference, or stripping you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stripping?&amp;quot; I gulped, wondering if our experiences were the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It was as if he could see bit of my body&amp;hellip;even before he got me to strip naked.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I found it impossible not to gape at her. I didn&amp;#39;t trust myself to speak so I stayed quiet.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I was sweeping the floor when he entered, like a dark god of some sort&amp;hellip;and when he offered me five hundred bucks to take off my shirt, I did it. Once I had my shirt off it was just a matter of taking one piece of additional clothing, one off after another. Then things just&amp;hellip;escalated and the next thing I knew, I was working naked.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A deep sigh escaped her as she recalled her time in the apartment. I wondered if she was aware of the noises coming from her lips. They were lewd, perverted sounds. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but deduce that she did a lot more than work in the nude for him.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did you&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; I started saying when she didn&amp;#39;t continue. &amp;quot;Did you do anything with him?&amp;quot; I wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she shook her head. &amp;quot;He just wanted to see me work naked,&amp;quot; she shrugged.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That must&amp;#39;ve been uncomfortable,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not really. It was&amp;hellip;oddly erotic.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Would you have&amp;mdash;you know?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
She turned to me, eyes wide, &amp;quot;Had sex with him? I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;quot; she shrugged. &amp;quot;There was something magnetic about him. I think I was ready to do anything with him. My clothes were off already anyways,&amp;quot; she murmured.&lt;br /&gt;
Then her eyes lit up and she squealed, &amp;quot;Did you do anything?!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I responded automatically. Then, in a less, panicked voice, &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; she sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you worked naked&amp;hellip;and then what happened?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing,&amp;quot; she said sadly. &amp;quot;I never got assigned back to the apartment,&amp;quot; she admitted, sounding thoroughly disappointed. &amp;quot;That was the easiest two thousand bucks I earned,&amp;quot; she giggled.&lt;br /&gt;
Coloring, I started folding my clothes, hoping she would stop talking and return to her work.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So, what happened with you today?&amp;quot; she asked&amp;hellip;" />
