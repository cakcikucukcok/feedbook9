  <title>Dominated - Malory Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The apartment&#39;s big enough for the three of us.&quot;
Falser words have never been spoken. Aching, lustful tension builds between the three roommates when Jane unwittingly moves in with her longtime friend-with-benefits Cain Hunter and her love interest, Samuel Smith.
When both men realize the roles they play in her lives, they decide to punish her in the most deviant, perverse method possible. Toys, whips, bondage, and more awaits Jane as she is dominated by the two alpha males, intent on making her theirs.
This standalone short contains steamy bondage, rough encounters, exhibitionism &amp; voyeurism, mmf, and spankings.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;Didn&#39;t have enough of me last time?&quot;
I was too busy staring at his face to remember why I was standing in front of his apartment with large haphazardly packed bags in each hand and a luggage beside me.
The man in front of me was perfection personified. He looked like he came straight from the showers. Water droplets clung from his half naked form.
It was hard to breathe with him being so close to me. I had to remind myself that I was at Cain&#39;s apartment. Or had I gotten the address wrong?
That was impossible. I could drive to Cain&#39;s apartment with my eyes closed.
So what was Samuel doing in Cain&#39;s apartment?!
&quot;I um... I-&quot; I blushed darkly, suddenly aware of how ridiculous I looked. I fixed my hair up somewhat and put on enough make up to cover the handprint on my cheek, but I still looked like a cheap whore standing in front of this Greek God of a man.
&quot;Jane?&quot; Cain&#39;s voice greeted from inside his apartment. A sense of relief fell over me at the sound of his footsteps coming towards me.
&quot;I was wondering if I could stay here tonight while you&#39;re still here?&quot; I explained weakly, trying to pull my gaze free from Samuel.
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not,&quot; he said. When he caught the look Samuel was giving me, he frowned darkly, &quot;Do you two know each other?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Samuel said, staring at me with a hint of smile. &quot;You could say that...&quot;" />
