  <title>The Sessions - Jack Aiden Pierce, Lindsay Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sessions&lt;/em&gt; is the book, &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/em&gt;, wanted to be, but wasn&amp;#39;t able to become. The main character, Ethan, is a practicing psychologist who was referred to therapy as part of a professional intervention program. &amp;quot;The Sessions&amp;quot; has two meanings. It refers to his erotic and taboo sexual sessions with women and his sessions with his therapist. Ethan is enigmatic. He is simulataneously selfless and selfish. He is likable, enviable, and erotically complex. But, because the book strived mightily to be authentic and honest, he can also be seen to be opportunistic and incorrigible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book explores the concepts of shame and guilt associated with human sexuality. It descends into the darkness of addiction. Above all, however, it is an erotic and powerful narrative. The images created in the reader&amp;#39;s mind are raw. They are born of a new, vital method of describing sex and human sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamics between the involved characters are ubiquitous. And for that reason, the narrative is acessible to all people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sessions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is at once thoughtful and profoundly sexual--some might say pornographic. It does not present watered-down sex. &amp;nbsp;Instead, it seeks to envelop the reader in a primal energy as it reveals Ethan&amp;#39;s sexual encounters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
