  <title>Polly Prude And The Virgin - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Polly Prude is horny! Her lover is away, and she needs a new man in her bed. Luckily, opportunity knocks in the form of Neil, a young man with confidence issues. And when Dr. Polly Peverly discovers that her patient is a virgin, it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before the clothes come off!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Polly smiled as she watched Neil undress. His reaction to her declaration of desire was everything she could have wished. Over the past few minutes she had watched as his expression changed from closely-contained terror to almost jubilant arousal and back again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sat quietly on the bed in the well-ordered bedroom. While she was serene on the outside, her mind roiled with pent-up lust. She bit her lip against her desire to shout at Neil to undress more quickly, to simply lay back on the bed and spread her legs so he could enter her as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No. Not for his first time. For him, it has to be special.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He kicked off his boxers, the waistband tangling around his ankle, so that it took multiple attempts before he was finally free of it. When he turned to face her, he was completely nude. Her breath hitched as she finally saw the whole of him. Not like Ronnie, no. Not like her brother. Neil didn&amp;#39;t have the size, the sculpted muscles brought on by years of training, the simple athletic grace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nor did he have the edge of the forbidden that brought such blazing heat to her lovemaking sessions with her brother. The taboo spice that had left them, more than once, almost clawing at each other in their rush to satisfy their desires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What he did have, however, was completely his. Sanity. Safety. And, she could sense, a single-minded desire to please her which was almost frightening in its intensity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be careful with this one, her mind warned her. He&amp;#39;s spent years pushing people away. Now he&amp;#39;s let you inside. If you hurt him, you may break him. Permanently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She rose and smiled at him, letting the tip of one finger barely brush the underside of his beautiful erection. His breath hissed between his teeth, and he shivered, closing his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are lovely, Neil.&amp;quot; She let her voice caress his name." />
