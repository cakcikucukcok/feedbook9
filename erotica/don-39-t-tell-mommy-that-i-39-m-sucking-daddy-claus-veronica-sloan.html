&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a curious smile, Cynthia rolled her shoulder against mine. &amp;quot;Has dad been talking about their sex life?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I blushed a little. &amp;quot;I know they don&amp;#39;t have one...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia ran her fingers through her honey blonde bangs. Her expression said this was a scandalous conversation but the gesture revealed the dirty gossip in her heart. &amp;quot;You shouldn&amp;#39;t get in the middle of it, Kay.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They always fight around this time of year,&amp;quot; I sighed. &amp;quot;More than usual, I mean.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; she sighed back. &amp;quot;My friends love Christmas but I just can&amp;#39;t wait for it to be over. I remember the only part I really liked was when dad dressed up like Santa. Wish he still did that, even though it&amp;#39;s silly.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A happy shiver ran down my spine. I still hadn&amp;#39;t told daddy about my present. &amp;quot;Mmm,&amp;quot; I purred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia&amp;#39;s eyes narrowed to slits. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s something up with you lately. I&amp;#39;ve only been back a few days but... Oh, God.&amp;quot; She grabbed my shoulder. &amp;quot;Kay, did you finally do it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was so focused on daddy that I couldn&amp;#39;t help grinning. &amp;quot;Not yet,&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s the guy?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not telling.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tell!&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Anyone I know?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Santa Claus.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She snorted as she laughed. &amp;quot;Uh-huh. Sure. Is he coming down the chimney tonight to stuff your stocking?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I hope so,&amp;quot; I said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Seriously, though. You have to use protection.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;quot;Nope. I want it to be perfect. I want him to feel me giving him everything.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia clucked her tongue. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not an option, honey. Birth control&amp;#39;s not enough.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not on it?&amp;quot; She smacked my arm. &amp;quot;Then you have to!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our conversation was sending nervous tingles up and down my naked calves. I bounced up on my toes and clenched the cheeks of my butt. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t tell mom, okay? I want him to have the best Christmas ever.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia opened her mouth to dispense more sisterly advice, then her teeth clamped shut with an audible click. She glanced quickly over the bannister again. &amp;quot;Wait a second. Who&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;him,&amp;#39; in this situation?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shot her a dirty, filthy, naughty smile. &amp;quot;I told you. Santa Claus.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My sister&amp;#39;s gray eyes grew into big, big circles. &amp;quot;Kaylee!&amp;quot; she hissed. &amp;quot;Are you insane?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I scooted my butt against her and grabbed her trembling hands. &amp;quot;Please don&amp;#39;t tell mommy,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I just want him so badly.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is crazy!&amp;quot; she said. She stared at me, breathing sharply, trying to find the sense in my hungry eyes. &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t--&amp;quot; She stopped herself and lowered her husky voice. &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t have sex with dad!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mommy won&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s something wrong with you. And if he knows then he&amp;#39;s in even more trouble than you are!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I squeezed her hands. &amp;quot;He doesn&amp;#39;t know yet. But we&amp;#39;ve been...doing things.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t think it was possible for her eyes to get any wider." />
