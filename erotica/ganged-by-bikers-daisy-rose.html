Michael is in for the ride of his life when he discovers the wallflower he remembers tutoring and deflowering has blossomed into a beautiful young woman.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
Erik could see the mountains from where he sat in his car. The drive had been a particularly long one, but it was comforting.&lt;br /&gt;
He had always liked long drives; it gave him time to think.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;#39;t enjoy where his mind was going as he drove towards the horizon. The sun was slowly setting and it reminded him of the night a few years ago with a beautiful young student who had someone managed to steal his heart completely.&lt;br /&gt;
And then vanish off the surface of earth as he knew it.&lt;br /&gt;
It had been a few years since the incident. He wondered why he was thinking about her now, of all places. He smoothed a hand over his hair and drew in a deep breath. The car spluttered and not for the first time that day, he considered stopping the car for a break. He glanced at the time on the dashboard. He was only a few hours away from his destination.&lt;br /&gt;
He had sat in the classroom for what felt like hours afterwards, thinking about what he&amp;#39;d done and why he felt so empty after doing it. It&amp;#39;s just sex after all. It wasn&amp;#39;t as if he hadn&amp;#39;t had meaningless one-night-stands before.&lt;br /&gt;
It felt different with her somehow. He felt complete with her.&lt;br /&gt;
He wanted to push her to the back of his mind and pretend nothing had happened but he never had the chance. She wasn&amp;#39;t there for him to pretend anything.&lt;br /&gt;
Her father had passed away unexpected and she was whisked away by a distant relative immediately after. There wasn&amp;#39;t even a funeral.&lt;br /&gt;
She was just gone.&lt;br /&gt;
His car spluttered and gave up on him completely and he swore harshly. The cars behind him honked and overtook him.&lt;br /&gt;
He got up and opened the hood of the car, then continued swearing as he realized he had no idea what he was looking at.&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, he wasn&amp;#39;t by the side of the road for long.&lt;br /&gt;
A pair of motorcyclists drove past and to his surprise, stopped. There was a man in a thick leather jacket and a woman following closely behind him. The woman hopped off first, walking past him to survey damage to the car. Smoke eased from the engines and she gave a short laugh.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Looks busted,&amp;quot; she said, her voice sounding oddly familiar to him. &amp;quot;What a shame,&amp;quot; she said, running her fingers over the convertible. He couldn&amp;#39;t help but stare.&lt;br /&gt;
The woman was looking at him oddly through the helmet, though he couldn&amp;#39;t see her face beyond the thick, darkened glass. What he could see, he liked. Her leather outfit clung to her every curve. She was a little on the skinny side, but perfect in every way imaginable." />
