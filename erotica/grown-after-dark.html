  <title>Grown - After Dark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A black blue-collar bull breeds a lavish Latina housewife for the entertainment of her rich white cuckhold husband.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
There you are minding your own business, sitting at the bar in this fancy hotel sipping on a kamikaze when this smiling idiot takes a seat next to you. He&amp;rsquo;s one of those straight-laced white guys ripped from the pages of GQ-types that looks like he just inherited the world as his oyster. You look like you, the big black junkyard mechanic that cleans up quite well thanks to a mall shopping spree from your former sugar mama sponsor. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you the typical nod and wave. Right off the bat, he offers to buy you another drink right off the spot. White men have often offered to buy you a drink plenty of times. Most believe because of your staggering height and noticeable girth that you must&amp;rsquo;ve played pro football in one life or another and are enjoying the fruits of your labor in Slow Savannah. Others are blatant in their wanton Mandingo fantasies. Either way, you politely tell them that you don&amp;rsquo;t swing that way. Your gay cousin from upstate has taught you well in the art of being politically gracious in declining their offer. But before you can though, the bartender is already sitting another kamikaze down in front of you." />
