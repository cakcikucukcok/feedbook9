  <title>Susie&#39;s Awakening - BJ Wane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the promiscuous Susie returns home from an evening of drinking and indiscriminate,though disappointing,sex, she&#39;s confronted by her irate brother, Jack. To her horror, she&#39;s upended for a humiliating spanking right in front of Jack&#39;s long time lover, Dave. When Jack realizes that this bare-assed spanking is turning Susie on, he knows exactly what his misbehaving sister needs. When Jack introduces Susie to his friend, Nicholas, she&#39;s astounded by the amazing man, his impressive size, his good looks, his cool, his calm, his no-nonsense attitude. &quot;&quot;The true test of a submissive is to do as she is told every time, even when it doesn&#39;t please her,&quot;&quot; Nicholas tells her.  Jack wants this man to train her. Although she&#39;s doubtful, an introductory session under this man&#39;s rule becomes the orgasmic bliss she&#39;s been hoping for. But can she truly submit to this man for more than night? It&#39;s a tall order, but just for the sexual benefits, Susie&#39;s willing to try. She&#39;ll spend a month at Nicholas&#39; exotic Maui estate where she&#39;ll be totally controlled by this dominant man, subject to punishment and a sexual training that will leave her breathless. Nicholas seems to know exactly what Susie most desires and is all too happy to administer the hard hot spankings that turn her on. When he introduces her to the pleasures of anal sex, she&#39;s left feeling totally used but thoroughly sated. Before this amazing vacation ends, however, Susie realizes that Nicholas&#39;s spanking discipline is heating up her romantic fires? is it possible that this arrangement doesn&#39;t have to end when her month in paradise is over?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
