  <title>Dream Angel Sister - Kethandra Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His exotic half-sister was always the pinnacle of erotic beauty to him, especially in that photo from long ago, a barely dressed angel radiating forbidden, divine sensuality. She had also been the source of his ultimate embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now she was here, in the same revealing costume, offering him a chance to make his most taboo fantasies very, very real.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I said that out loud, didn&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded agreement. &amp;quot;Yes. You did.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oops. Can I blame the THC?&amp;quot; A wide yawn followed the question. &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;ll add sleepiness to the blame list.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So a hit of pot makes you say thoughts out loud and makes you suddenly sleepy?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And horny.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, horny. I forgot that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She rolled her eyes. &amp;quot;Sure you did. Liar.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hesitated, caught. Then we both burst out laughing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stretched her arms out wide, the action pushing her chest out against the fabric. It was accompanied by a second yawn. She raised one eyebrow. &amp;quot;And pot apparently makes my little brother stare at his sister&amp;#39;s chest.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Uhh. I think I was staring at them before we got high. In my defense, that dress has always showed them off, and they are pretty much perfect.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She looked surprised at the compliment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know I was surprised I had actually said the last part. &amp;quot;Wait. Did I say that out loud?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We laughed again, harder, more nervous. Wiping a tear away from one eye, she asked. &amp;quot;Benny? You said this dress always displayed my little chest well. Do you mean in that old picture?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt like a caught teenager all over again. Words escaped me in a stoned rush. &amp;quot;Do you wanna know what happened to it? My mom threw it, shattered it against that wall.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pointed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wha...why would she do that?&amp;quot; Angelique looked hurt. Her voice was small.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had dug my own grave with my blurted outburst, leading her to the question I really shouldn&amp;#39;t answer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She was mad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;At me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; The pain on her face made my sister look so vulnerable. &amp;quot;Not mad at you at all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then...&amp;quot; I saw her lower lip start to quiver. &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because...I liked it too much.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Too much? Dad did hint about you really liking that picture but...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Alright.&amp;quot; I gritted my teeth, then blurted out my confession. &amp;quot;Mom caught me beating off, looking at it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stared, mouth wide open.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My shoulders dropped. My voice was low. &amp;quot;Way more than you ever wanted to know about your half-brother, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I reached for the vape pen, determined to numb my embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wait.&amp;quot; Her command stopped me. Her hand came out, palm up. &amp;quot;I think I need a hit first, to wrap my head around what I just think I heard.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I handed it to her, eyes down. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right. This might be better.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come here.&amp;quot; Long slim mahogany arms reached out to me. She stepped close before I could decide to move, hugging me tight. &amp;quot;That is so sweet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So sweet? Perving over a staged photo of my hot half-sister? She continued to hold me, until I felt my muscles begin to relax. Once I was past the worst of my angry shame I became aware of the feeling of her warm breath against my neck, her slim body pressed close to mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her next words were almost inaudible, especially as I was distracted by her lips brushing the tender skin under my ear as she spoke. &amp;quot;And it&amp;#39;s kinda hot.&amp;quot;" />
