Why is so much emphasis put on finding a good man? Well Nina wants this too. Has she accomplished her mission? Omar is sophisticated, handsome and well educated.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;She had traveled many places, seen so many different things and had so many experiences. But she still had not obtained the one thing; so many women cherish to help complete their existence, a good man. She realized a woman did not necessarily need a man, but someone to spend quality time with or someone to spend the rest of her life with would be nice. Nina sat and thought about all the loves she had lost over the years in these different places she had traveled. None of them made her heart skip a beat or made her soul ache. She felther priorrelationship had shown some progress toward lasting, but yet again happiness had evaded her. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;Then she meets Omar. Where had he been hiding all her life?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black&quot;&gt;His voice was so sexy, and he was a cutie! He had coco brown skin, hazel eyes and short black curly hair. He was dressed in a brown Armani suit, with nice shoes and he was looking scrupulous, she licked her lips as she replied back Hello. The conversation was pleasing. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
