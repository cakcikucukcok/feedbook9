  <title>You&#39;re Just What I Needed - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When love comes calling, does it make a difference whose blood is running in your veins? Apparently not. Justin looks so much like his father. The father whom he has never known, and I want him badly. Screw social mores and the taboo. I&amp;#39;m going to get his DNA tested...and then what? It won&amp;#39;t matter to me. But I just have to know if Justin is the child I was pregnant with when his father was killed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My God, he is the spitting image of David, the love of my life that was taken from me far too soon by a drunk driver. It&amp;rsquo;s eerie how much this boy looks like him. I wonder&amp;hellip;could it be him? The boy I had as a result of our love?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How old are you, Justin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Does it matter?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, I just wanted your entry in my diary to reflect the facts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m messing with him and, fortunately, he knows it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m twenty-four. How old are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Cheeky boy, you know better than to ask that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Time to let out the vamp in me. Time to get down to business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s very handsome, looking a bit older than his years. He&amp;rsquo;s tall, just like David. He&amp;rsquo;s muscular, and as I unzip his pants and pull out his cock, I see he is hung just like David was. He could be David&amp;rsquo;s clone. The more I see as I undress him, the more I realize what I have feared since first seeing him yesterday. He is my son. But he looks so much like David that I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself. I want to make love to him. I want to see if he makes love like David. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to take the chance he is not mine and David&amp;rsquo;s boy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love seducing young men. It is one of my favorite pastimes. Of course, most of them have no idea what they&amp;rsquo;re doing in bed, but I coach them along, tell them what I want. They leave happy and well satisfied. I have a list of them I can call on at any moment and they will come running. But something tells me I can&amp;rsquo;t just crook my finger at Justin. He&amp;rsquo;s going to be a challenge." />
