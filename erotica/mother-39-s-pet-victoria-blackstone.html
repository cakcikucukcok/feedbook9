  <title>Mother&#39;s Pet - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s a neglected woman to do when her handsome, hung son comes sniffing around?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Momma&amp;rsquo;s pet?&amp;rdquo; I murmured.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled around my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I cupped his cheek, once he released my fingers, and told him, with nothing but my eyes, how much I cherish him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I watched his gaze track to my vagina, so open and so desperate for attention, watched as he hungered for me. That hunger was intoxicating, leaving my nipples and my clit aching for his touch, but that desire was tempered with the knowledge that we could never be intimate. &amp;ldquo;Mustn&amp;rsquo;t lust after your mother, sweetheart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He moved against me, rapt, making me wonder whether he&amp;rsquo;d even heard me. It was a moot point, though; right or wrong, he does lust after me, he has since he entered puberty, and in my heart of hearts, I prayed he continued to lust after me until I grew too old to appreciate the attention. I lifted his chin with a finger. &amp;ldquo;You want in there, don&amp;rsquo;t you, baby?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded, smiling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I exhaled, my head shaking, my smile fading. &amp;ldquo;We can never be intimate,&amp;rdquo; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He held my gaze, waiting, but when I offered him a sad smile, he spoke, his deep, low voice sounding deafening, even over the drone of the television. &amp;ldquo;I need you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt the words, as much as heard them. The need he spoke of was clear in his eyes, and I knew that if the sofa wasn&amp;rsquo;t blocking my view of the front of his sweats, I&amp;rsquo;d see the physical manifestation of his need, as well. I closed my eyes, hoping to banish the mental image that formed, the one of his hard, young cock, so big and so thick and so desperate to please. He isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one with needs." />
