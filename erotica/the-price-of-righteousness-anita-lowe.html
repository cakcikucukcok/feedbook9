  <title>The Price of Righteousness - Anita Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hank Moore was a Chicago reporter in 1972 on the trail of a big case when he was murdered in an unsolved hit-and-run. He left behind a mourning wife and daughter, young Libby Moore. Even so, Libby is not one to give in to despair. Instead, she follows in her fathers footsteps, and three years later she is a feature reporter for the Chicago Sun. Her first assignment is covering a banquet to raise money for the families of Vietnam vets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banquet is organized by Maria Sanitonini, a powerful woman at the head of a rich Chicago family. Libby also makes the acquaintance of the young and charming Michael Sanitonini, and she cant help but give in to his romantic advances. Its an exciting time for Libby, with a new job and now a new love. Soon, though, Libbys investigative skills are put to the test as she develops suspicion for the Sanitonini clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has infiltrated all levels of local government, and Libby has reason to believe Michaels family might be involved. While visiting Maria Sanitoninis medical clinic, shady secrets begin to surface. Libby cant help but delve deeply into the darkness, while she also continues to search for her fathers killer. She quickly learns that doing what is right is not doing what is easy, and she might lose more than the man she loves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
