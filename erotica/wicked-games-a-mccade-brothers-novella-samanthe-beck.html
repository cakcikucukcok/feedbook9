  <title>Wicked Games (A McCade Brothers Novella) - Samanthe Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a battle of wills becomes a game of lust, one wrong move could be fatal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actress Stacy Roberts is ready to ride her rising star straight to Hollywood&#39;s A-list. All she needs is the famous Hollywood Hedonism party (check), one very naughty angel costume (check), and a few drinks to get her sexy swagger back (check, check). Tonight, she is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; aching for her hot, hard-bodied ex. Or worrying about the threatening letters signed by &quot;Your Worst Nightmare.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Detective Ian Ford, &quot;nightmare&quot; doesn&#39;t begin to cover it. Whatever demons prompted Stacy to cut and run have him tied up in knots. Worse, his ex is dressed to kill any man with a pulse, and Ian is seeing red. If Stacy wants trouble, she&#39;ll find it. Only Ian&#39;s going to make damned sure that the only trouble she gets is with &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.There are no rules. They either both win, or they both lose. But this time, there&#39;s an extra player--one who&#39;s determined to make sure this is the very last game Stacy plays...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released as part of the Lovers Unmasked anthology. Now available individually!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
