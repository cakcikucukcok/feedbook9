      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Liv never expected to rekindle her romance with her college boyfriend, who&#39;s now a hard-bodied, tattooed biker.  And she never imagined sharing herself with his entire gang.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shock can feel Liv pulling away from him, just like she did all those years ago.  Her lies are a painful reminder that she&#39;s not ready for anything more than a good time in bed, but he&#39;s not willing to let her go. He lost her once, and it&#39;s never happening again. Faced with losing the one thing he&#39;s always wanted, he must prove to Liv that what they have is more than physical and that his heart is in her hands.  But is she ready to give him hers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part three of HARD RIDE, a three part novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
