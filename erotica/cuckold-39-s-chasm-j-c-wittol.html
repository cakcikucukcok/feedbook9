  <title>Cuckold&#39;s Chasm - J.C. Wittol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The perfect cuckold relationship blows up when the needs of a cuckold husband, his gorgeous hotwife, her possessive lesbian lover, and her rich, handsome boyfriend diverge. They have it all&amp;hellip;until Cynthia pushes Nick in a new direction, and Collin makes him an incredible offer. No one can predict the outcome! Cuckold&amp;rsquo;s Chasm brings Nick and Nicole&amp;rsquo;s wild cuckold ride to an unbelievable conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia took a long drink of her Sangria, and while her face was expressionless, I sensed an underlying tension in her body.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
My voice made her jerk. She swallowed another gulp of Sangria, and gave me a shaky smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. I just need to get used to the idea of sharing Nicole. I&amp;rsquo;ve had her to myself, and it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic.&amp;rdquo; She sighed, and motioned at the door. &amp;ldquo;But she has Collin, and he&amp;rsquo;s been extremely welcoming. I just need to adjust, I guess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s any consolation, you&amp;rsquo;ve brought a lot of happiness to my wife, and I know she cares for you deeply.&amp;rdquo; It was my turn to sigh. &amp;ldquo;I know you two just met, but you&amp;rsquo;re already very important to her&amp;hellip;and to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thank you. That&amp;rsquo;s nice to hear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re welcome. It&amp;rsquo;s also one hundred percent true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What about you?&amp;rdquo; She squeezed my hand. &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you worried about all of this? Me. Collin. I mean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia left the question unfinished, but I knew what she was getting at, and it was an excellent question. The ride we&amp;rsquo;d been on lately was exciting and fun, but it had to end eventually. Would I be standing next to Nicole when it ended? Or would Collin? Or Cynthia?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was wracked with worry at first,&amp;rdquo; I replied. &amp;ldquo;Nicole and I spent a lot of time talking about her relationship with Collin. I was convinced she was going to fall in love with him, and sooner or later she&amp;rsquo;d leave me. I mean, he has everything, right? Money, success, good looks, an athletic body, and he&amp;rsquo;s genuinely a good person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;All that, huh? Now, I&amp;rsquo;m getting worried.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I straightened in my seat, and leaned forward. &amp;ldquo;But here&amp;rsquo;s the deal. Nicole will freely admit that she loves being with Collin, but she&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;i&gt;in love&lt;/i&gt; with him.&amp;rdquo; I made quotations with my fingers. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a huge difference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right. For women especially, there&amp;rsquo;s a difference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The other thing that makes me confident I won&amp;rsquo;t lose my wife is Collin has never asked for more. He&amp;rsquo;s never hinted Nicole should leave me. Not once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia cocked her head, and gave me a strange look.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nothing,&amp;rdquo; she said quickly, and raised her hand. I narrowed my eyes at her, and after a second she continued, &amp;ldquo;Nicole told me about the wedding ring issue. How you settled it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I just thought it was a good solution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I knew immediately there was more. &amp;ldquo;Cynthia. If there&amp;rsquo;s something more, please tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
My heart started beating quickly and fear spread slowly throughout my body. Was there more? Was my confidence misplaced? Did Collin want more from Nicole?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m new here, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know all the personalities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tell ya what&amp;hellip;why don&amp;rsquo;t you tell me, and I&amp;rsquo;ll help you interpret?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She hesitated a moment, then took the plunge. &amp;ldquo;Well, you know John? Collin&amp;rsquo;s friend?&amp;rdquo; I nodded, and resisted the urge to roll my eyes. &amp;ldquo;During Collin&amp;rsquo;s party, he kept asking Collin when he was going to pop the question to Nicole.&amp;rdquo; She looked at me carefully. &amp;ldquo;He seemed really serious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What did Collin say?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Collin just blew him off, but a few other people at the party picked up on it, and it became something of a theme. Finally I heard Collin say he&amp;rsquo;d make sure everyone got invitations to the wedding.&amp;rdquo;" />
