  <title>Unchained Desires - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anne isn&amp;#39;t a stranger to carnal desires. After all, she&amp;#39;s employed in a place where pleasure and pain are all in the day&amp;#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;
When two black alpha males pay for an hour of her time, she quickly finds out that she just needed the right kind of domination.&lt;br /&gt;
Anthony and Dante know their ways around toys. More importantly, they know exactly how to make Anne scream.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The pictures don&amp;#39;t do you justice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Blood rushed to my cheeks and I lowered my lashes over my eyes even though I knew he couldn&amp;#39;t see me. When I was able to look up again, my gaze went everywhere but the six foot tall, blue-eyed Greek-god just a few steps away. Instead, I stared at the massive room around me, beautiful paintings adorning the ivory walls.&lt;br /&gt;
A massive bed was behind me, but I couldn&amp;#39;t see it. My arms were hung above my head, heavy and aching ever so slightly. My toes barely touched the ground. It was hard to move, let alone turn around to survey my surrounding.&lt;br /&gt;
The only thing I was wearing was a cardboard masquerade mask to shield my eyes. He was wearing the same mask, but he was still in full suit. I had expected him to be naked.&lt;br /&gt;
When Tom asked if I was ready, I told him I was with certainty. But now that I was here, helpless with a man whose name I didn&amp;#39;t even know, I wasn&amp;#39;t so certain. This would be the first time I had ever done anything close to... whatever this was. Sex. That was it. Pure, unadulterated carnal pleasures.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never done this before,&amp;quot; I murmured, my voice barely above a whimper. I was frightened, but also incredibly aroused. It was hard not to be. The man in front of me was ridiculously good looking. His eyes were an intense shade of green that seemed to look inside me, awakening a desire that hid beneath the frightened nerves.&lt;br /&gt;
I shuddered as he circled me, drinking in the sight of my naked body with his eyes, so intense, so unfamiliar. When he spoke, his voice was so deep and rough that it vibrated through my body like an electric current passing through my bones.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a virgin,&amp;quot; I said, louder, since I wasn&amp;#39;t certain if he heard me the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He closed in on me like a panther approaching a prey that had no way of getting away. When he finally touched me, I gasped.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your fingers are cold,&amp;quot; I whimpered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sorry,&amp;quot; he said, not sounding sorry at all. His fingers grazed across my bare shoulders, leaving goosebumps in his wake. He danced his fingers over my shoulderblades and I trembled under his touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you want me to continue?&amp;quot; he asked, almost careful, as if worried I would say no.&lt;br /&gt;
It was tempting, but I nodded tentatively. &amp;quot;Yes. Please continue, sir.&amp;quot;" />
