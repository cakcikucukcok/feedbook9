  <title>In Love with the Other Man - Francina Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of the lives of four ladies: Denise, Keisha, Liz, and Tonya. Denise is living the most normal life she possible can with her husband, Eric, the man she loves and whom she will never leave. Keisha, a real estate agent, enjoys the single life until she meets a man named Robert, who is a handsome and rich bachelor. Keisha is very independent, living her life and doing her own thing; no man is going to change her lifestyle . . . or will he? Liz is married with three children, but she is still lonely because her husband, Mr. Frank, is never home. Liz meets a young man named Terrence and falls deeply in love with him. What will Liz do? Is she in love with the other man? Tonya does anything with anyone and lives the single life. Tonya doesn&#39;t care about herself, her five-year-old child, or her mother, even though she is still living at her mother&#39;s home. Watch out for Tonya; she may be with your man . . . or your woman." />
