  <title>My Tutor&#39;s Taking Me Everywhere - Candi Desires</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She takes in a shuddering breath and looks him in the eyes. &amp;quot;Will you be my first?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Cheyenne, a younger woman, just loves spending time with an older man. But will her relationship with Parker go beyond that of being friends? Will she end up giving her first time to him?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;You know you want it!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The campfire crackles as Parker and his 18-year old friend&amp;#39;s daughter sit around it. Off in the woods he listens to the sounds of owls making night calls to one another.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Cheyenne sits in front of the fire, staring into the flames. The sight of them dancing, swirling about, is almost hypnotic to her. She&amp;#39;s tired, but she doesn&amp;#39;t want to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Cheyenne and her buddy get along great, but ever since she became a woman she&amp;#39;s found herself having&amp;hellip;thoughts about him. Dirty thoughts. Thoughts that keep her awake at night, with the only way to calm herself being to put a hand down between her legs and rub. Parker&amp;#39;s shirt is tight today, and it clings to his muscular body. She&amp;#39;s had to bite her lip more than once already.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Parker hasn&amp;#39;t had sex in a while. A LONG while. He&amp;#39;s been going through a bit of a dry spell lately. He used to have a great sex life, but lately that hasn&amp;#39;t been the case.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;And now, ever since Cheyenne&amp;#39;s turned 18, all Parker has been able to think about is banging his little princess, pumping her full of his seed, giving her a baby. He tried taking care of it once, imagining it, and he came almost immediately. It&amp;#39;s all he can think about.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Cheyenne sees blinking light floating through the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ooh, fireflies!&amp;quot; she says, getting up.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Parker looks around and sees them too. He gets up out of his chair and follows his little princess into the trees as she tries to catch them.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re hard to get!&amp;quot; she says, turning around to look at her buddy. Her eyes meet up with his.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Cheyenne&amp;#39;s mind seems to go blank. She&amp;#39;s shocked that all that&amp;#39;s running through her head is primal thoughts, carnal desires. She looks at her buddy&amp;mdash;at this incredible specimen of man&amp;mdash;and almost can&amp;#39;t stop herself. It&amp;#39;s all she wants, to just grab onto him and kiss him, grab onto his hard tool and slide it into her virgin body.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You know what?&amp;quot; Cheyenne says. &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#39;s too hot to worry about responsibilities. I&amp;#39;m just going to give them up for the day.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah?&amp;quot; Parker asks his little princess. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;re you going to do instead?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;And Cheyenne gives him a little smile. &amp;quot;Well I have to think of something, now don&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He smiles back, and they keep looking at each other. Cheyenne feels her heart begin to pound in her chest." />
