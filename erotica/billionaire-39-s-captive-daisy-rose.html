  <title>Billionaire&#39;s Captive - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brazen and beautiful private detective, Mia Faye has never been caught doing anything illegal. That is, until she takes a new job and agrees to steal something deeply personal from an infamous billionaire, Damon Davis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She steals what she needs and escapes, only to fall into the clutches of the mysterious man soon after. And what begins as a simple job turns into so much more...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Contrary to what you may be thinking, I wasn&amp;#39;t there to steal anything. No, I was here to procure something. A single piece of evidence that may be enough to crush his entire umpire. A picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just one simple picture and we&amp;#39;ll have fifty grand in our pockets. My pocket. But James probably deserved something around twenty percent of that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t want to work as a private detective. I was neither born nor raised in it like a lot of men in the profession, nor was I trained for it. Not many women became private detectives. It was the sort of work that just didn&amp;#39;t appeal to little girls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere along the line, I made all the right choices, or rather, all the wrong choices to bring me down that career path. Maybe I should have made a different choice way back then. Or maybe I should just choose another career. I was young enough to go to college and get a degree. But times were tough and the work paid well. James said I had the knack for the work. I had the patience, the stealth, and the guts. I also had the luck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I focused my attention back to the task at hand as I walked out of the shadows. This part of the house was brightly lit, but I should be alright as long as I didn&amp;#39;t run into anybody. I wasn&amp;#39;t dressed anywhere near fancily enough to be a houseguest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just as I suspected, there was nobody else roaming the mansion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Damon wanted to keep whatever it was that they were doing in the dungeon entirely private. And that was what I was here for. The risk was high, but the reward meant we would have enough to finally get that vacation I was promised when I first started the partnership with James. We were a two-man army. Well, a one man, one woman army, but close enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We weren&amp;#39;t told how risky the job was when we first took it. That came later. The initial job description was vague:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Find something we can use against Damon Hunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I smiled when I was first told that. It was easy to find something against a virile young man. Or so I thought. James said it was reckless to take a job just because it &amp;#39;looked easy&amp;#39;. I should&amp;#39;ve listened to him." />
