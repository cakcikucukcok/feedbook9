      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Remember I&#39;m not a country boy. My body&#39;s not used to this.&quot; After sharing herself with Robby, Roy and Frank, it seems that Claire&#39;s schedule and body is getting too busy. But then she gets a surprise visit from city boyfriend Shane. Claire might have enjoyed her experiences with her three country boys, but Shane is just different. But Claire needs to behave. She is in her parents&#39; house after all. She cannot just ravage Shane any time she wants. Then Claire gets a visit from Frank. She is afraid he wants a quickie while Shane went out with her father. But Frank says he&#39;s there to drop something off in Shane&#39;s behest. Now what is Shane up to? Why is he cavorting with someone who blackmailed Claire into sleeping with him?" />
