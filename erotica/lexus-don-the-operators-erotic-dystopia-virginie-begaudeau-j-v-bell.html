  <title>LeXuS: Don, The Operators - erotic dystopia - Virginie Begaudeau, J. V. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Don is an experienced and esteemed Operator. His two Workers know how to satisfy his every need. But when a new Worker turns up at his door, he abandons the rulebook and finds himself caught in a web of deceit and blackmail, haunted by memories from the past. What is his dark secret and what does it mean for his future in Belgrame?
In a dystopian future, the city of Belgrame is governed by a set of laws called LeXuS. Under a strict totalitarian regime, sex has become a privilege which can be bought, sold or earned. Having the right to sex indicates social success, and due to strict control, sexual crimes have become a distant memory.
However, all is not well in Belgrame. A group of renegades are leading a rebellion to overthrow the LeXuS regime and grant sexual freedom to all.
Welcome to Belgrame, a world which you will discover through the eyes of its inhabitants. 
Each character brings a new story, which can be read independently of the others. This is the story of Don, matriculation number 189." />
