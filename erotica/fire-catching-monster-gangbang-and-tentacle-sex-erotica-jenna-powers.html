  <title>Fire Catching (Monster Gangbang and Tentacle Sex Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Years ago, the world population reached its weak. In an effort to stem population, sex was disallowed and only certain areas were allowed to have sex. In its place was the Horny Games. A Labyrinth full of monsters that a woman from each area had to pass through. Whoever made it through would bring unlimited sex back to their area for a year.
Karen volunteered from her area, taking place of her sister Linda. Stuck in the Labyrinth full of man-made monsters, Karen battled her way to the exit. She was betrayed by the person she loved the most. In Fire Catching, the second book to the Horny Games, Karen manages to escape the Labyrinth, bringing about a push for change. The Government decides to change the rules at the next annual event, bringing back former winners. This places Karen right back into a new Labyrinth full of monsters and this time, tentacles, waiting to fill her up. Does this new version of the Games get Karen revenge?
Warning! This 10,769 word explicit story contains sex with monsters (dragons, goblins, centaurs and more) and tentacle sex with multiple women.
It is highly advised that The Horny Games be read first." />
