  <title>That&#39;s What Friends Are For - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When he was younger, Justin promised his mother he would be nothing like his womanizing cheat of a father. Part of that promise included waiting to lose his virginity until he met the right girl. Now 18, Justin is finally going to have his first time! His mother is going away for the weekend, and his hot blonde girlfriend, Jen, promises she is going to come over and spend the weekend with him.
Things are looking good for Justin except that his best friend, tomboy Samantha, doesn&#39;t trust Jen, and thinks Justin is making a mistake. &quot;Sam&quot; turns out to be right when Justin finds out Jen has been sleeping around on him, and he’s heartbroken and frustrated. But he won&#39;t be for long, because Sam says she is on her way to cheer him up.
When she arrives, Justin is surprised to find his normally plain friend dressed to kill, and looking just as beautiful as any girl he has ever been interested in. The surprise continues when Sam tells him that she would be happy to be his first lover. After all, won&#39;t best friends do anything for each other?
