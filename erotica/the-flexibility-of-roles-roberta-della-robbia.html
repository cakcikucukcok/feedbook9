  <title>THE FLEXIBILITY of Roles - Roberta della Robbia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IN LINGUA INGLESE&lt;br /&gt;
Roberta della Robbia, a talented young writer, debuts with the erotic literature. &amp;quot;The Flexibility of the roles will be the dawn of a resurgent love&amp;quot; is a novel that reveals the beauty of Mantua with a sentimental-erotic intrigue worthy of the best authors. A complete writer, not only erotic but a narrative talent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since she had known him, exactly one week before, Elena had not heard from him.&lt;br /&gt;
Gianni, in his blissful ignorance, still had felt a change in the behavior of his partner, noting indisputable traces of impatience and nervousness; he, therefore, became more and more persistent in seeking her sexually, but she was light years away from him, from their beautiful home and even from herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She dreamed only of being taken by that particular man, to give him the sodomy of her almost virginal backside. She was thirsty for new experiences, to finally be tamed by someone who had the right charisma and potential to do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He has eventually started to follow your advice, that recalcitrant new purchase you did,&amp;quot; announced Christopher to Elena when she crossed the threshold of the office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Apparently, you were right about the reliability of my instincts&amp;quot; echoed back she, trying to ward off the bad mood which she brought with herself like a black cloud over her head since she had gone out of her home.&lt;br /&gt;
She walked to her polished mahogany desk, ignoring the inquisitive glances of her secretary, who was watching her with too much interest.&lt;br /&gt;
While she was getting the computer started, annoyed by the long and impertinent scrutiny of her employee, she had a sudden rush of anger, &amp;quot;What the hell are you looking at now?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He played the innocent and moaned an answer of denial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While she was visioning a manuscript Clare had sent her, Elena remembered that she hadn&amp;rsquo;t checked the mails yet. She automatically clicked on her already set email address. She ran the cursor on the many advertising mails that she would have wiped out without even reading them as usual, until one named Esclaves caught her attention. Had she read that right? She got back and opened the e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;
