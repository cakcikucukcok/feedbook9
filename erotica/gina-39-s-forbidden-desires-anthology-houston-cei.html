~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a beautiful, warm sunny day when Ricky drove with Jolene to Santa Cruz. Wearing only shorts, T-shirts and thongs on their feet, they enjoyed the many rides, the fast foods, and having a souvenir picture taken in a mock old western saloon setting. As the evening was drawing to a close, they strolled hand in hand on the sand near the ebb tide. The beauty of the blue, foamy waves of the Pacific Ocean with a background of the red sunset was breathtaking. At that point in time, Ricky felt like he was on a date with a beautiful woman and Jolene felt as if she were having family time with her son. Ricky unlocked the door to usher his mother into the charming cottage, the same one his father had rented for the family many years ago. They both had broad grins on their faces as they viewed the interior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom, it&amp;#39;s been a wonderful day for me and I hope you have equally enjoyed yourself even though Dad cannot be with us,&amp;quot; Ricky said as he turned to face her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ricky, my sweet son, even though it has been difficult at times, I have long ago accepted your father&amp;#39;s passing. I&amp;#39;m just delighted to still have you...and yes, I&amp;#39;ve had a wonderful time,&amp;quot; Jolene responded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As they stood gazing into each other&amp;#39;s eyes, Ricky was both excited and nervous about being so physically close to his mother. He desperately wanted to kiss her and as he remained speechless, she sensed his apprehension and asked, &amp;quot;Ricky, is something wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just...well...I think I should kiss my date,&amp;quot; he answered slowly. &amp;quot;May I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jolene chuckled and said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be silly. Of course you may kiss your mother.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wonder what she&amp;#39;s gonna think after I do it, he thought to himself. He first planted a tender kiss on her lips and then drew his head back to check her response. She was surprised by his kiss being on the lips and in spite of the puzzled look on her face, he was ready to gamble. Ricky embraced his mother tightly and pressed his lips against hers more intensely than the first time. When Ricky slid his tongue into his mother&amp;#39;s mouth, he was suddenly surprised that she opened her mouth to allow a free mingling of their tongues. Neither he nor she knew what the other was thinking but for that moment in time passion caught hold of both mother and son. After they finally broke the long, passionate French kiss, they looked into each other&amp;#39;s eyes, and as if they were in a trance, they began to undress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ricky was already standing in the nude in front of his mother as she removed her T-shirt and shorts. She then unsnapped her bra and tossed it aside, kicked off her thongs and stepped out of her panties. They were excited and wanted to make love at that very instant with no concern about right or wrong or the taboo nature of what was about to happen. That was one time when the passion in the hearts of both lovers was so intense that there would be no foreplay. Jolene moved to the double bed to position herself on her back. There were still no words spoken as they both just wanted the spirit of the moment to stay as it was to begin their intimate touch. With her arms around her son&amp;#39;s neck, Jolene initiated an open-mouthed kiss. As their tongues mingled feverishly, they moved harmoniously and were still so caught up in passion that they exchanged no words." />
