  <title>Stranded With My Sister - Justin Luxure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Flight M-445 disappeared over the Pacific and unbeknownst to the rest of the world, there were two survivors; siblings Ethan and Emma. Washing ashore &amp;ldquo;Hell&amp;rsquo;s Island&amp;rdquo; they are forced to work together in order to survive, the two forming a strong bond. They can only live so long without their primitive human needs boiling over. The siblings decide to indulge on their urges, leading to a forbidden relationship that would make Adam and Eve blush.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My Sister stood up; the sand gracefully spilling off her smooth body. I was as still as could be; captivated by her every move. She seductively walked over in front of me as I looked up at her towering figure. Reaching behind her back, Emma unlatched her bra and allowed the straps to slip down over her shoulders. Stretching her arms down, she allowed it to fall to the ground; revealing her dark puffed out nipples and perky breasts. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d seen her sinful body so up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do you think?&amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp;ldquo;Think you&amp;rsquo;d like to give it a go?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cool night air made her nipples erect; making them look much more appetizing. Goose bumps riddled her body and I could feel myself growing hard. Emma looked down at the bulge forming in my tight underwear &amp;ndash; there was no hiding it. The outline of my cock was visible and protruding through the weathered fabric." />
