~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
Laertes warred within his soul. He craved this maiden with a passion indescribable, the peerless beauty whose very lust blossomed from a font of sweetest purity. She begged to know the ways of men and women and he was fain to indulge her. But what great sin would it be to profane a heart so true? He touched the hand upon his trousers and whispered, &amp;quot;With all that I am, dearest Rapunzel, know that I love thee. But I cannot grant this wish. In the world you know not, disgrace follows women who are loved by men such as I.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Men such as you?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;A prince?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A lie,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I am a prince of thieves, no more. I scaled this tower in the hopes of plundering its vaunted treasures. Instead I have found the greatest treasure in the five kingdoms...and she has unmanned me with her goodness.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel&amp;#39;s fingers touched Laertes&amp;#39; trousers. &amp;quot;That is another lie. You are not unmanned, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Any wretched criminal would ravish you in a heartbeat,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I shall not. I swear it.&amp;quot; He dared not look at her again.&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel gasped to see the tears well in his sapphire eyes. Tenderly, she held his cheek. &amp;quot;Look upon me, Laertes. I bear the marks of your passion and know no shame. What you are a prince of makes no matter to me. I am a princess of despair! I would give you any treasure in this tower just to be rid of the smallest piece of my prison. And I would not interrupt this joyous union for the sake of a world I&amp;#39;ve never known. I promise you every treasure in this wretched tower if only you will take me too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Laertes laced his fingers through her own. &amp;quot;I will take you, Rapunzel, I swear it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And will you show me your manhood?&amp;quot; she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wish to,&amp;quot; he groaned. &amp;quot;I want to! But I pledged to my lost mother&amp;#39;s soul I&amp;#39;d never rob an unwed woman of her virtue.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel freed her hand from Laertes&amp;#39; grasp. &amp;quot;My virtue! If my virtue prohibits you from bestowing the knowledge I have waited my whole life to know, I charge you to plunder it as you would plunder my tower!&amp;quot; With haste, her nimble fingers began to unlace his trousers. &amp;quot;My virtue has gained me naught but sleepless nights,&amp;quot; she scoffed. &amp;quot;I long to be rid of virtue!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Laertes seized her hand. &amp;quot;Rapunzel, I made a vow! As God as my witness, or even your precious moon, I shall not break it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel wailed with fury. She clutched the man by his thick shoulders and searched his sky blue eyes. &amp;quot;Then do not break your vow!&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Make me your wife.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Laertes gaped at the girl. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel pushed herself into his lap and hung her arms about his tan neck. &amp;quot;Wed me, Laertes. Now! In this very moment.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t the power to do that,&amp;quot; he whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes you do,&amp;quot; she whispered back. She tugged at her ruined neckline and pushed her naked chest into his tunic. &amp;quot;Say I am your wife,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Marry me now and we shall consummate it here in my bedroom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Laertes clasped Rapunzel&amp;#39;s cheeks between his callused palms. &amp;quot;As God as my witness, and your moon, I declare that we are man and wife.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Their kiss made the constellations gallop in the dimming sky." />
