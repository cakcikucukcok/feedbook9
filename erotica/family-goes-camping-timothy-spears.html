  <title>Family Goes Camping - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m bored.&amp;quot; Damn, I&amp;#39;m glad that mom is all the way at the other end of the porch reading one of her books. If she had heard my sister say that, she&amp;#39;d have made me spend the next hour or two or more entertaining my sister by playing cards or some other stupid stuff. But I&amp;#39;d better come up with something to distract my sister before she thinks of going over to mom and repeating that. &amp;quot;Kerri, why didn&amp;#39;t you bring some books to read, you knew&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What the Hell! Are you watching me and jerking off? You pervert!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What? How? Why? I flipped the magazine down to cover my crotch while I reached under to stuff myself back into my shorts and zip up. Somehow, Kerri had gotten up and walked over closer to me without me even noticing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No! No, Kerri, I wasn&amp;#39;t looking at you! I... I... I was daydreaming. I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about you. If I had been watching you, I would have noticed before you got over here. I&amp;#39;m sorry; I should have been paying more attention. I should have seen you get up.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I saw her eyes slip down and glance at my crotch area. I didn&amp;#39;t know how much she had seen, but I was just finishing zipping up my shorts so I started to stand up to face her eye to eye while I re-buckled my belt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My magazine flipped over as it fell from my lap, and of course, it had to land with my porn mag showing. The picture on the page opposite the story I was reading, was a topless model, with her bikini bottoms untied and just starting to fall away from her pussy. In the background, was a couple in doggy position; apparently talking with another couple doing cowgirl on a pool deck chair. But I didn&amp;#39;t notice that then, I was noticing her eyes suddenly get as big as dinner plates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Holy shit! No wonder you were beating off. Oh, I should have thought to bring... Wait, you did bring more than just one magazine, didn&amp;#39;t you? How many did you bring? Do they have good close-ups of the guys, too? Do any have good girl-girl action? Can I borrow one?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop! Slow down, Kerri, I have two magazines, and I only got them the night before we left on vacation. So, I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to see what all are in them. Today was the first time I&amp;#39;ve had any chance to even get a look past the listing of articles. I only have the one with me out here now. But, I&amp;#39;ll let you have a look at them, too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait a minute... What just happened? Did I just agree to let my sister look at my porn collection?" />
