  <title>Wet - Joylynn M. Jossel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;Thicker Than Water,&amp;quot; Tye and Wade are identical twin brothers; inseparable as boys, and now men, no one ever thought anything could come between them, but &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; did. Dinah is the woman of every man&amp;#39;s dreams. She&amp;#39;s smart, sexy and down to earth. She&amp;#39;s like one of the guys, so much so that next to his brother, Dinah is Wade&amp;#39;s very best friend. After a night of alcohol and misinterpreted emotions, Wade and Dinah cross the friendship boundary line. Wade turns off his emotions when Tye&amp;rsquo;s strong attraction to Dinah connects the two. It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of time before Wade&amp;rsquo;s suppressed feelings get the best of him&amp;hellip;and bring out the worst.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;The Ghostwriter,&amp;quot; although Rhain Garrett&amp;rsquo;s daily nine to five pays for her necessities in life, her nightly side gig as a ghostwriter is her true passion. For extra money and to feed her literary desires, Rhain takes other people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and translates them into sentimental keepsakes. What seemed like an uneventful life for Rhain all changes after a chance meeting with the smooth talking debonair, Fred.&amp;nbsp; Just as quickly as the sun rises on Rhain&amp;rsquo;s dull life, it sets. When one of her ghostwriting gigs lands her as the number one suspect in a murder case, she soon learns that Fred might not be who he says he is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joylynn M. Jossel, author of &lt;em&gt;The Root of All Evil&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;When Souls Mate&lt;/em&gt;, brings yet another page turning, spicy thriller. Brace yourself, because in this emotional roller-coaster of a ride, when it rains, it pours. So try to stay dry, but the forecast shows that chances are...you&amp;#39;ll get WET!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
