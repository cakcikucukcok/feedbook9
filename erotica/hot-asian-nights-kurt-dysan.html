&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For most of the long flight, Bel fidgeted uncomfortably in her seat. It was fourteen hours from Amsterdam to Malaysia&amp;nbsp; Kuala Lumpur. Although she desperately needed to sleep, so much had happened in the previous few hours that she couldn&amp;#39;t even rest. Recent events kept running through her head like a bad movie. She&amp;#39;d replay them and worry about what might happen next. Some of it anyway. She wasn&amp;#39;t even certain of all the details of the mess she&amp;#39;d left behind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It had been hard, a real heart-rending decision to go on without Mickey, but she&amp;#39;d had to&amp;nbsp; she knew that much. He wasn&amp;#39;t there when the boarding call came, and by then she was certain he wouldn&amp;#39;t be coming. She couldn&amp;#39;t afford to wait around to see. If she missed this flight...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Landing in Kuala Lumpur, she wandered into the transit lounge where she intended to catch an onward flight to Phnom Penh. Continuing on the way they&amp;#39;d planned seemed the best course. Looking at the departure board, for a moment, she considered changing to a Bangkok flight. There were a lot of them headed that way. Bangkok was a big place and it would be easier to lose herself in a big city like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then she smiled. Heading for Bangkok was a clich. Everyone on the run in Asia tried to hide in Bangkok. They&amp;#39;d be looking for her there&amp;nbsp; assuming they were looking for her at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not knowing was a bitch, but it wasn&amp;#39;t like she could call someone and ask about Mickey. When she&amp;#39;d been waiting for her flight in Amsterdam, she&amp;#39;d caught a short news report on the television that confirmed the police in Amsterdam had apprehended a suspect in what they called a violent robbery. The description of the guy had sure sounded like Mickey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was what made her so sure he wasn&amp;#39;t going to catch the flight. That&amp;#39;s why she had left. She&amp;#39;d stood there, wondering, feeling anxious, avoiding making a decision as the plane started to board. Her stomach turned sour with the anxiety, and then she&amp;#39;d just boarded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And now, she stared at the departures and knew that she needed to stay with the plan. She went to the gate for a small regional airline, and when the call came, got in line and found her seat on the small airliner that shuttled people from Malaysia to Cambodia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the flight, she sat next to a chatty woman about her age, twenty-seven, who told her that her name was Gretchen and she&amp;#39;d been in the US visiting her family. As the woman provided a distraction, Bel listened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gretchen was a thin, pale blonde with a gold ring piercing her nostril. She was also very excited. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be so glad to get back to Phnom Penh.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why? Any particular reason?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The girl gave her a wicked grin. &amp;quot;I miss my boyfriend Dieter. That&amp;#39;s the main thing. And I want to get back to the life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The life?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A pleasant smile crossed her face. &amp;quot;Bopping around Asia. Wandering around, going to places where there are parties, maybe get a short-term job tending bar for a time and just being free in ways you can&amp;#39;t anywhere else. You haven&amp;#39;t been here before?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head. &amp;quot;No. First time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you know anyone there?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not a soul.&amp;quot;" />
