  <title>The Nun&#39;s Corruption - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The nuns of St. Guinevere have done it. In this sequel to &amp;quot;The Nun&amp;#39;s Seduction,&amp;quot; the angel Belial has been summoned, brought to earth to satisfy their every lusty desire. But some of the sisters are getting cold feet. Do they have the strength to withstand his sexual power? Or will they take part in &amp;quot;The Nun&amp;#39;s Corruption?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The entire day seemed to coalesce, suddenly, snapping into focus as instantly as if she had been suffering from vision problems and had been handed a set of glasses. She knew, in that moment, that she never wanted to be parted from Belial, or from Abigail or Consuela. Her heart expanded, breaking the shackles of her self-imposed solitude.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The angel beneath her nodded, as if he could read her mind. &amp;quot;Now?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;God, yes!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She tried to shift, to take his jutting manhood inside her body, but found her effort stymied as Belial&amp;#39;s hands closed around her narrow hips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her mouth hung open with disbelief as she found herself lifted effortlessly off the ground, hanging in midair. Her toes reached down, seeking the solidity of the earth, but found only the warm summer breeze. &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Spread your legs for me, lovely Merry.&amp;quot; Belial smiled up at her, and she felt herself smiling in response. &amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t done this in a very long time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re insane.&amp;quot; But she did as he bid, spreading her legs wide, as if she were some sort of erotic gymnast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, how slowly he lowered her, aiming her seething center at the head of his phallus. As it approached her, she bit her lip, knowing that this step, one taken, was irrevocable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Belial seemed to sense her hesitation, for his eyes locked with hers. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not too late. You can always say no. I&amp;#39;ll stop. I&amp;#39;ll always stop, if you ask.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head. &amp;quot;No. I want this.&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t stop now for anything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Brave Meredith.&amp;quot; Slowly, with infinite gentleness, he lowered her, his angelic phallus piercing her, filling her with holy rapture..." />
