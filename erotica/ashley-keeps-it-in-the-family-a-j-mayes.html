  <title>Ashley Keeps It in The Family - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Driving home after a morning of sex with her mom, Ashley&amp;#39;s mind drifted to her son, Kyle. Years earlier, on the night she turned eighteen, Ashley&amp;#39;s parents and uncle introduced her to the world of incest. Excited by sex with family members, Ashley planned to seduce Kyle that very night. The next day, her mother joins in the fun, and together, the women bring Kyle into the fold, teaching him how to satisfy two insatiable women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Distracted by images of Kyle driving his shaft into her, Ashley lost track of time, and still rubbing her wet lips, yanked her hand out of her shorts when she heard his deep voice, &amp;ldquo;Playing with yourself, mom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit, Kyle. You startled me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Maybe I shoulda let you finish&amp;hellip; looked like you were enjoying a hot fantasy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sorry you saw that&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a man in like forty-eight hours.&amp;rdquo; Ashley hopped off the lounge. &amp;ldquo;Believe it or not, your mom gets horny too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Jesus, mom&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t need to know that.&amp;rdquo; Kyle&amp;rsquo;s eyes roamed over Ashley&amp;rsquo;s body. &amp;ldquo;Nice outfit. Could the top be any smaller, or those shorts any shorter? And did you have to wear &amp;lsquo;fuck me&amp;rsquo; heels?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like what I&amp;rsquo;m wearing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll take it off, young man. Except for the heels that is. You know I&amp;rsquo;m wild enough to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m having enough trouble remembering you&amp;rsquo;re my mom as it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ashley reached out, and pulling Kyle close, hugged him tightly. Still holding him in her arms, Ashley tilted her head, and pressing her lips against Kyle&amp;rsquo;s, held the kiss far longer than decent society would accept. Pulling away, Ashley caressed his cheek and purred, &amp;ldquo;Welcome home, handsome. I can feel you&amp;rsquo;re excited to see me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;With the way you&amp;rsquo;re dressed and what I saw you doing, what did you expect, mom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right. Sorry. Do you need to go take care of it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nah. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s fun to let it stay like this awhile.&amp;rdquo; Kyle grinned and adjusted the bulge in his shorts. &amp;ldquo;Besides, you&amp;rsquo;ll just say or do something to make it hard again anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Knew I raised a smart young man.&amp;rdquo; Ashley slipped an arm through Kyle&amp;rsquo;s. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, son&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s sit on the patio and catch up before we grill the steaks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ashley led Kyle to a couch on the patio, and sitting next to him, traced her fingers over his leg, occasionally moving close to his erection while they talked for an hour. Feeling her fingers lightly brush his shaft and linger a moment, Kyle swallowed hard, and taking a breath said, &amp;ldquo;Please, mom&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re killing me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just checking to see if you&amp;rsquo;re still aroused.&amp;rdquo; Ashley moved her fingers and squeezed Kyle&amp;rsquo;s knee. &amp;ldquo;Sorry, son&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll stop teasing you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks. I think the damn thing&amp;rsquo;s gonna stay like this &amp;lsquo;til I take care of it tonight. Hell, as horny as you&amp;rsquo;re making me, it may keep me up all night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooh. Maybe you should call one of your fuck buddies&amp;hellip; you can pretend they&amp;rsquo;re me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t work. None of &amp;lsquo;em hold a candle to you, mom. Me pretending the girls I fuck are you, never works&amp;hellip; believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Really?&amp;rdquo; Ashley turned and touched Kyle&amp;rsquo;s cheek. &amp;ldquo;You imagine your girlfriends are me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;All the time&amp;hellip; once, I even yelled your name while I came.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit, son&amp;hellip; now, you&amp;rsquo;re making me excited.&amp;rdquo;" />
