  <title>The Pleasure of His Bed - Melissa MacNeal, Donna Grant, Annalise Russell</title>

What privateer Damon Delacroix doesn&#39;t know is how much Sophia longs to be dominated. But soon it is Damon who is enslaved as he gives up all control and embarks on a wild journey of carnal pleasure.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  Ties That Bind   Donna Grant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Queen Jarina never imagined that the foul play which brought her to the enemy kingdom of Pereth would also make her a willing love slave, eager to fulfill her master&#39;s every desire. Now Jarina&#39;s only wish is to satisfy her master&#39;s insatiable appetite.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  In His Bed   Annalise Russell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    In exchange for safe passage on his ship, Chessa strikes a daring bargain with Bodin--a dangerously handsome Viking--to become his sex slave and see to his needs. But she soon learns that to live under Bodin&#39;s command is to submit to the most sensual, skilled lovemaking she&#39;s always dreamed of.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;             &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annalise Russell &lt;/b&gt;is a true romantic, right down to her toes. She&#39;s been an avid reader of romance novels since she started sneaking them out of her mother&#39;s closet as a teenager. Writing, in one form or another, has been a way of life since high school thanks to the encouragement of teachers and professors along the way. A social psychologist by degree, she&#39;s a member of a behavioral sciences research team and loves to people watch when in public. She lives in the gorgeous state of Idaho with her husband, two kids, and two neurotic dogs." />
