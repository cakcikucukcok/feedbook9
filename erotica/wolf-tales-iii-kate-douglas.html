What she needs is a new challenge, and she finds him in Jacob Trent. The tall, gorgeous panther of a man has an aura of danger about him, a sense that he does what he pleases--in life and in a woman&#39;s bed.

For Jacob, no woman was ever enough to satisfy him. But he&#39;s never met anyone like Shannon before. Something about her awakens a powerful hunger, a white-hot desire that must be explored, no matter the cost. He was sent to protect Shannon.
