&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; she asked, biting her lower lip shyly.
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not familiar with some of the names,&quot; I said, &quot;but the rest of the guys actually seem like a good fit.&quot; I bit my lip and frowned, &quot;Maybe not Irving. That guy gives me the creeps,&quot; I said.
&quot;He does?&quot; she gasped. It seemed like news to her.
&quot;Yeah. Even when I was a Dom, he kept making advances at me...&quot; I found myself deliberately isolating him from the other subs I knew. &quot;I know some people like rough, but he plays a little too close to breaking hard limits for my taste...&quot;
She looked as if she was making a mental note of that. Then, she sighed and looked almost disappointed at me. She said, &quot;I wish you could come to more meetings, Ally. Your input would be so helpful for us when it comes to choosing the right Dom,&quot; she said.
I didn&#39;t know what to say, so I kept quiet.
&quot;Other than him, the rest of the guys are okay, right?&quot; she asked.
I considered getting rid of Victor as a candidate with the guise of keeping work and personal relationship separate but I knew Lisa could see past the obvious lie. There were two levels of management between us and nobody could really object to who the boss dated.
&quot;Do you really think Victor would be a good fit?&quot; I asked.
She looked torn between telling the truth and lying out of fear, and then said with absolute conviction:
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Okay,&quot; I nodded, biting my lower lip. &quot;So, how&#39;s your Dom treating you?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Oh,&quot; her face flamed red. &quot;There&#39;s something I want to show you,&quot; she said a little shyly.
My eyes widened as she started unbuttoning her shirt. My heart thumped rapidly and I wisely kept my mouth shut, less I say anything I&#39;d regret later.
Then, she twisted around so I could see the freshly-tattooed words on her upper back. It was still red and painful, but the words were clear.
I want to be owned, to be used. My time, my thoughts, my dreams, my life. Yours.
And just like that, I felt as if a missing puzzle piece of my heart had just fallen into place. This was what I wanted: A surrender so absolute that it enveloped me completely.
I knew I was prepared for a Dom. I was prepared to belong.
But nothing prepared me for Victor.
