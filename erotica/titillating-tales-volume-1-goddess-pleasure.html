  <title>Titillating Tales - Volume 1 - Goddess Pleasure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This 85,000+ word erotica anthology (volume one) is written and intended for a mature audience.
CONTENTS:
1. Finding Love and Ecstasy, With You
2. Old Maud&#39;s Addiction to Her Electrical Vibrating Massager
3. Hucow Heights
4. Dancing Into Ecstasy, With You
5. Beth&#39;s Hypnotic Sexy Wolf Shifter
Excerpt:
My knickers feel damp. Again... Not to worry though, the spare pair in my handbag will do, later, on my coffee break when I&#39;ll replace them. I&#39;ll nip into the ladies’ room and will pleasure myself for a quickie. I&#39;ve never been with a man before, despite having an ex-boyfriend. Not treating me right, I soon dumped him. I bet Dan isn&#39;t like that. He used to get on my nerves. He doesn&#39;t even notice me though, now, every time he walks past. Or maybe he does. I don&#39;t know, yet. I mean, he could be eyeing me up through his sunglasses and not letting on that he&#39;s perfectly well aware of my obvious lust for his body. 
What I wouldn&#39;t give to rip his t-shirt off with my teeth and have him pleasure me in the street. For all I know, he might not be well-endowed and the bulge I see when his jacket isn&#39;t hiding it may have padding down there for all I know, but in my fantasies, it&#39;s a lot different. God, I want him so much. I need him to touch me. I shouldn&#39;t be having these thoughts but it&#39;s not like we&#39;re related and we&#39;re both adults. I doubt he&#39;ll ever feel the same intensity that I&#39;m feeling and I doubt he&#39;s telepathic either, so I&#39;ll just go on enjoying my kinky fantasies. Nobody has to ever know...
