  <title>Mediplex No.5 - Morgan Destera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
First day on the job for Annette opens an otherwise closed mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
His breath was warm in her ear and she found herself holding her breath. For a moment, she hesitated, trying not to tremble. She could feel the power he emanated. One of his hands slid over her shoulder and into the open cleavage of her blouse. It slid under her bra and cupped her breast. She remained absolutely still. &amp;ldquo;I want to help you. I don&amp;#39;t want to see your family split apart. But I need your consent, Annette. I can&amp;#39;t do this without your agreement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stayed still, her breathing suddenly fast and hitching. She closed her eyes and swallowed hard. &amp;ldquo;Yes...&amp;rdquo; she heard herself say, and then gasped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She could feel the Admin smile. He withdrew his hand and offered it to her. She took it and he helped her stand, still facing away from him. He nuzzled her neck. &amp;ldquo;Just try to relax. I know it may be difficult, but remember you have just allowed me to do this to you. You are frustrated and uptight. There&amp;#39;s no need to be. Mediplex is a place to heal everything &amp;ndash; including mental and emotional scars.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He turned her to face him, but stepped away. &amp;ldquo;The first thing I need for you to do is take off your clothes. By doing this, I will know you are doing so of your own accord. Or you can walk out that door. Whatever the decision, your life will be changed.&amp;rdquo;" />
