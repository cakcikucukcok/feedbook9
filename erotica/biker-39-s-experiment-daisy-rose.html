  <title>Biker&#39;s Experiment - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cassie stares at the burly biker in front of her, certain that she is making the worse decision in her life. The incredibly sexy man is offering her a significant amount of money in exchange for something that she has never even dreamed of doing:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surrender to five alpha males.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They don&amp;#39;t know how inexperienced she is. She is sure they don&amp;#39;t care. Every logical cell in her brain is telling her to turn tail and run, but she stares down the man twice her size and shakes his hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We have a deal.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Looks like you didn&amp;#39;t know a thing. If you don&amp;#39;t want to continue, that&amp;#39;s fine. You can walk out of here right now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked up at him then. If I was honest with myself, I had been looking for a way out the moment I stepped into the bar. There were too many men and too much testosterone. I didn&amp;#39;t expect to have him offer me an out to me so easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyebrows raised when he caught my expression. &amp;quot;Are you really going to quit?&amp;quot; he asked, still with that infuriating grin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My cheeks burned and I avoided looking at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I drank the rest of the sweet cocktail until I was sucking up air with the straw. I kept the plastic straw in my mouth and chewed on the ends as he continued to talk, my tongue swirling around the end of the tube in contemplation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to think any less of you. It takes a certain kind of woman to handle men like us.&amp;quot; There was not a hint of amusement in his eyes when I finally looked back at him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I moistened my lips as I drank in the sight of his hard muscles, bulging with every little action. He had both palms on the counter top, thumbs pointing towards me. He was completely right. It took a certain kind of woman to handle bikers like them. They were too big, too muscular, too much for me to handle. A drop of sweat trickled down my cheek and I cleared my throat before making my decision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no other candidate for the job,&amp;quot; I said, crossing my arms over my chest. &amp;quot;I say we double my fee.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must&amp;#39;ve gone absolutely insane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He blinked rapidly, then with a slow, disbelieving shake of his head, started laughing, the corner of his eyes wrinkling in mirth. &amp;quot;Well, I say it&amp;#39;s still a good deal.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart seemed to freeze, then start beating with a violent speed. Blood rushed to my head, making it difficult to think. I didn&amp;#39;t think he would agree to my terms to easily. It made me wonder how much he was being offered. Two thousand dollars for a day&amp;#39;s work. It sounded too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My skin tingled. It was too late to back down now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We have a deal.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I flinched inwardly when we shook hands. This was either going to be the best decision of my life, or the worst." />
