  <title>Meeting Vicki - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like many of my lady friends, Vicki likes to role play. This is a story about June, a bisexual woman, and I pretending to be married and meeting Vicki for a fun threesome. We all have a great time, and will be getting together for more sexual fun in the future.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
The most recent was a threesome with Vicki, who wanted to role-play an encounter among strangers. With that in mind, we went to her apartment house with the plan to be for all three of us to get on the elevator together, with June and I pretending to be married and pretending to be strangers to Vicki. After striking up a conversation, we would go to her apartment. We waited in the lobby and, when we saw Vicki enter, struggling with two large boxes, we got on the elevator and held the door for her. Once inside, Vicki asked June to push the button for the fifth floor.
&quot;Already pushed,&quot; June replied. &quot;That&#39;s our floor too.&quot;
&quot;I haven&#39;t seen you before. Are you new in the building?&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t live in the building,&quot; I answered. &quot;We&#39;re just dropping in to Harry Brown&#39;s apartment to feed his fish and water his plants. My name is George and this is my wife, June.&quot;
&quot;Hi, George. Hi June. My name is Vicki.&quot;
The elevator stopped and we all stepped out. June and I offered to help with the boxes and we each took one and followed Vicki to her apartment. She opened the door and invited us in.
&quot;Can you take those boxes into the bedroom, please?&quot; Vicki asked. She led us into the room and turned on the light. We set the boxes, which were just empty props anyhow, next to the window. With the ice broken, we stood in a group next to her queen-size bed.
&quot;You sure seem like nice people,&quot; Vicki said, putting her arm around my waist.
&quot;So do you,&quot; June replied, putting her arm around the other woman and gently patting her ass.
&quot;We&#39;re glad we met you,&quot; I added, squeezing the other side of Vicki&#39;s shapely bottom.
&quot;I know,&quot; Vicki responded reaching over to pat the bulge in my pants. &quot;I can tell.&quot;" />
