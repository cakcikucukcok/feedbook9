  <title>Feel the Heat - P.J. Mellor, Lydia Parks, Lorie O&#39;Clare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brave, brawny, and ready for action, these firefighters know how to set their women ablaze.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; by Lorie O&#39;Clare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Hamilton has had a crush on Nate Armstrong since they were kids. But she&#39;s told herself to get over it-as a firefighter Nate is in mortal danger every day. But when their friend and Nate&#39;s fellow firefighter dies young in a suspicious house fire, Mary decides life is too short to let cold fear beat out hot desire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &quot;Heat Wave&quot; by P.J. Mellor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summer Wadsworth is dangerously close to overheating. Her house has burned down, and Thorne Paxton, the firefighter who rescues her from the flames, is blazing hot. She&#39;s ready to call him in for a little off-duty fun. But &quot;duty&quot; has a nasty way of following him home. And with a man like Thorne, the pleasure can&#39;t hide how easy it is to get burned.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &quot;Smoldering Lust&quot; by Lydia Parks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local girl Hannah Hayward has made a name for herself in the mayor&#39;s office. But when her town&#39;s new fire chief turns out to be bad boy Lee Evans, back after fourteen years and looking even sexier than she remembers, she&#39;s got more to worry about than his budget requests. He&#39;s too good to believe.  .  . and too hot to deny." />
