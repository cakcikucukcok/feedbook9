  <title>On The Naughty List - Frankie Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
To spice things up in her relationship, Sarah schedules a sexy Christmas boudoir photo shoot with the local photographer Victor Ren. It&amp;rsquo;s only when she arrives that she realizes he is the nerdy kid from high school, Ben Simon. The shoot begins normally but quickly unravels when Ben suggests that she takes off her top. One moment they&amp;rsquo;re taking photos, the next they&amp;rsquo;re fucking. Ben records the entire thing and sends pictures to blackmail Sarah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Once locked in the safety of her shared apartment, she tears the envelope open and her trembling hands drop the contents. It&amp;rsquo;s pictures, pictures of her naked and spread for Ben and his camera. Pictures of her, eyes hooded with undisguised lust, tweaking her nipples. Bent over in her silk thong. Legs thrown open wantonly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; she whispers. Hot tears prickle behind her eyes as she crawls around, scooping them up and shuffling them together. Her body is bared and there on film, guilty evidence of her moment of weakness. Stating her right in the face. She sobs, holding the incriminating photos against her chest. She picks up the envelope, and a scrap of paper slips out, flutters to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Looks like you&amp;rsquo;re on the naughty list this year, Sarah. And naughty girl that now belongs to me. - Ben.&amp;rdquo;" />
