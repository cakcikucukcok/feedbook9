  <title>Journey from December to May - P. A. Loder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arayna Callahan and Tasha Carson board the train that will take them from Penn Station to the Carson mansion on Long Island for an obligatory appearance at Tashas parents annual political fundraising extravaganza. Attending the stuffy affair is a small price to pay for the rent-free week at the Carsons opulent New York City penthouse overlooking Central Park.
This year, the typically tiresome event proves to be anything but. In attendance is Gates Gregory, the much older, high-powered, high-profile top cop from Chicago.
Even though hes not her type, his effect on Arayna has her immediately on the defensive. For the past four years, Arayna and her best friend, Tasha, have been living in Florida and are regular members of an elite BDSM club. Arayna craves the command and control she finds only with a dominant. A vanilla relationship does not interest her. Gates projects the power and command, but can a man who is in the lifestyle satisfy her submissive soul?
Despite a stern warning from Tasha that Gates leaves broken hearts in his wake, the two set off on a harmless, exciting, and seductive vacation divergence.
Gates is simply a distraction, and Arayna has no intention of becoming another notch on his already-crammed bedpost. Little does he know just whats hidden beneath the sexy and imposing facade. In that one fated moment, neither suspects how much their innocent dalliance will change their lives. But will the change be for the better, or will it destroy them both?" />
