          &lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s her main target…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Julie Kent is looking for excitement in her life. She wants to save the world, but her crime-fighting career has been more paperwork than criminals. And if Eric Ranger has any say in the matter, she won&#39;t get out of her cubicle! Eric is a battle-scarred agent temporarily helping his friend&#39;s security business. He wants to protect Julie from the world he knows.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She reminds him of what he&#39;s been fighting for; he&#39;s attracted to Julie, but he won&#39;t touch her. He even goes so far as to let her think she isn&#39;t sexy enough to be a decoy on their current case. But Julie turns the tables on Eric by making the first move.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trying out one sexy alias after another, Julie finds trouble wherever she turns. And though Eric is determined to be at her side to protect her, now he just can&#39;t keep his hands off her…&lt;/p&gt;
