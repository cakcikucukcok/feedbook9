  <title>An Encounter With Paris - Blair Erotica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the end of a successful business trip to Paris, Irene is in a mood for adventure. She allows herself to be swept up in a sexual adventure by a handsome stranger who seems to understand her every unfulfilled desire. She gives herself into his confident and sensual hands, and he introduces her to new sensual pleasures, including a delicious threesome with a woman they pick up in the hotel bar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Irene sat at a table by the sidewalk where she could watch people. She had finished her negotiations early. Her opposite number had focused on flirting with her, while she kept her attention on business. Now the work was done. Determined to enjoy her last few days in Paris, she was thinking of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had packed her business clothing away and gotten out her summer casual dresses. She fancied a fling of some sort. Ideally, she could have an experience to remember, to savor when she was back in the straightjacket of her own city and family. Irene understood marketing well, and her dress was a soft cotton print that kept her shoulders bare and showed her legs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sat with her legs crossed alongside the table and ordered a Cappuccino and sipped it. She knew that her legs were attractive and she wanted to ensure they were seen. Her smile and her interest in the people passing by were both genuine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her best friend called this kind of dress a bait dress. &amp;quot;When you wish to attract the hungry ones, yet seem vaguely innocent, this is the thing,&amp;quot; he had said. Its colorful print pattern caught the eye; it hugged her body without being tight. Naturally, she wore no bra.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several men smiled at her in a curious, inquisitive way that she found delightful and flattering. None of them approached her, however. A thin young woman with a small dog stopped near her and smiled. They made eye contact, but then passed on before Irene could decide if, given her playful mood, a woman would be as much fun as a man. It said something about her mindset that she had considered responding to that invitation, for she had never had sex with a woman; until that svelte woman had given her that glance, that suggestive look, she&amp;#39;d never really thought about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what, exactly, was this mood telling her? She was being uncharacteristically indecisive, she decided. That wasn&amp;#39;t good. Without a vision, a clear idea of what she wanted, adventure couldn&amp;#39;t begin. She could easily wind up spending her time doing little more than daydreaming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Examining her vision, her desire, Irene knew it involved sex, but not just casual sex. Picking up a man and taking him to her room would be a simple thing. She&amp;#39;d done that, just to have experienced it. But now, she wanted something more; something different and exciting. The stuff of fantasy. &amp;quot;I want,&amp;quot; she told herself, &amp;quot;someone to come by who will take me on an adventure. I want a man who understands adventure to sweep me up into something exciting, not just a handsome guy to invite me into his bed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This romantic notion, while unlikely, gave the morning some desirable clarity. The thought of someone sweeping her off to the unknown made her forehead feel warm. &amp;quot;That would be perfect,&amp;quot; she thought." />
