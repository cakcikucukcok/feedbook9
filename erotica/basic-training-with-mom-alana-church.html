      <meta name="description" content="Joe left for the army when he was eighteen, determined to find a better life. But when he comes back from basic, he&amp;#39;s determined to lose his virginity. And when his mother Lois finds out what her son has planned, she decides she will be the only woman for him. It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Basic Training...With Mom!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hello? Can I help you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman turned to her. &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; She was Latina, with a face that was too strong-featured to be precisely considered beautiful, but with an erect carriage and bountiful curves. &amp;ldquo;Can you tell me where twelve thirty-eight Bakewell is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She pointed, aggravated again that the landlady had never put new numbers on the front of the house. &amp;ldquo;Right there. I&amp;rsquo;m going there, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh.&amp;rdquo; The woman looked at her. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this was going to be a doubles session.&amp;rdquo; She extended her hand. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Consuela.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took it automatically. &amp;ldquo;Lois.&amp;rdquo; She blinked. A doubles session?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So do you know the guy?&amp;rdquo; Consuela eyed her, lingering on her uniform. &amp;ldquo;Is this going to be a roleplay? I wish someone would have told me. Josephine is usually pretty good about warning me about that sort of thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, honey? Is this your first time?&amp;rdquo; Consuela&amp;rsquo;s eyes were sympathetic. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. Josephine screens everyone really well. So what are you supposed to be? Secretary? Teacher?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; She was beginning to understand what was going on, and started to panic. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m his mother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His mother? I like it. So what&amp;rsquo;s the roleplay? Do you find us screwing, then get jealous?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No. No!&amp;rdquo; she said waving her arms. &amp;ldquo;Stop. I&amp;rsquo;m his mother. Really his mother.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consuela shrugged, though her eyes widened slightly. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not judging you. Though I usually charge double if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be trying to get both of you off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She dug her hands into her scalp, tempted to scream. &amp;ldquo;Listen,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Can we get in my car and talk?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A wicked smile drifted over the Latina woman&amp;rsquo;s lips. &amp;ldquo;Sure, honey.&amp;rdquo; She set her hand on her chest, just above her breasts. &amp;ldquo;Whatever you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;All right,&amp;rdquo; Lois said a few minutes later. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a&amp;hellip;a&amp;hellip;a&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;An escort,&amp;rdquo; Consuela said easily. &amp;ldquo;A prostitute. A hooker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;re here to see my son? Joe?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took a deep breath. &amp;ldquo;Well, there isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a three-way. Or roleplay. Or anything else like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh. Crap. That&amp;rsquo;s disappointing. Because let me tell you something, girl. You are fine.&amp;rdquo; She grinned. &amp;ldquo;And so is your boy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was really looking forward to it, to be honest,&amp;rdquo; Consuela chattered on. &amp;ldquo;Sure you don&amp;rsquo;t want to invite me in?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Um&amp;hellip;no. I&amp;rsquo;m not a lesbian. Not bisexual, either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t fair,&amp;rdquo; the dark-skinned woman sighed. &amp;ldquo;You get to screw him, and I don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not screwing my son!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo; Consuela said. &amp;ldquo;You want to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t! Why would you even think something like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Honey.&amp;rdquo; She shook her head pityingly. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you think I know what a horny woman looks like?&amp;rdquo;" />
