      <meta name="description" content="Susan is a sexually frustrated young woman. Her few experiences have been unfulfilling, and she aches for satisfaction. Then at a homecoming party for her brother on leave from the Marines, she meets her soulmate&amp;mdash;his best buddy, a handsome, buffed Afro-American.

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They felt the glances of onlookers who appeared to view them as the ideal couple; he even noticed that the beauty of his companion was catching the eyes of so many other men and she likewise could see that Lonny with his fabulous physique and handsome face were turning heads and catching eyes. People vacationing in Waikiki are there to have a good time and there was not a hint of disapproval of this racially mixed union. They dashed out into the warm, blue water of the Pacific Ocean here so close to the Equator. They swam around, floated and did the backstroke, laughing like children as they frolicked in the water. When the waves are still fairly calm in the morning, there are usually native Hawaiians on the beach offering surfing lessons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How about a surfing lesson, Miss Susan?&amp;quot; he asked her. &amp;quot;I would wager that you&amp;#39;ll be able to stand up on your first try,&amp;quot; he assured her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, I don&amp;#39;t know about that, but I&amp;#39;m certainly up for a challenge,&amp;quot; she answered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There on the sand the instructor taught her how to stand up on the board when ready after the swell. Then, the three of them paddled out to sea about a hundred yards on their respective boards to wait for the swells. When the first swell came, Lonny started paddling and Susan did also at the prompting of the instructor. Lonny stood up immediately to sail safely to the shore, but Susan was right behind him standing up also and was able to keep her balance. When they got to the shore, they jumped into each other&amp;#39;s arms as they were both elated that Susan made it on her first ever try. Susan felt very secure in the arms of this huge, handsome man. They went back out into the water and did the same over and over until Susan could time the swell without any prompting. After about two hours of this vigorous sport, they were pretty tired and hungry. They went to lunch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After lunch, the couple continued to enjoy the beauty of the beach, the hot sand beneath their feet, the view of the surfers riding the more serious waves and all the unknown but happy faces from the mainland and other parts of the world enjoying their vacations. They returned to their hotel room in mid-afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After entering the room, Susan took him by the hands as they faced each other and said, &amp;quot;Okay, this is our second afternoon in this room and I now consider it a sacred place. Are you ready to continue to go beyond the physical and into the spiritual; are you as anxious to get there as I am?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps, you have been there before but I have never been, and I am here with the man I want to take me there.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Yes...yes,&amp;quot; he answered to her questions and added, &amp;quot;l will do my best to get us both where we want to go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She still wanted to be the guide through their journey as she said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s lie down on the bed beside each other, you on your back. I want to look at your handsome physique again.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She ran her fingers through the hair on his chest as she said, &amp;quot;We did some pretty nice touching yesterday and this morning but what&amp;#39;s coming is going to be more intense. We&amp;#39;ll continue to take it slowly, but I assure you that our first time to make love completely is coming soon. Think about how many times you&amp;#39;ve thought of it today and yesterday and you are wondering if I can really deliver what I have promised. We&amp;#39;re going to find out.&amp;quot;" />
