  <title>Summoning a Daemon - Kurt Dysan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cecil and Flora fled from a cruel Lord. If he captures them, he will ravish Flora with Cecil watching and then torture and kill them both. According to the Gypsy who is hiding them, their only hope is to be rescued by a Daemon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman smiled. &amp;quot;Then there is some hope for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her heart pounded. &amp;quot;How?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tonight is all Hallow&amp;#39;s Eve. It will be a full moon. While my magic is feeble, things are in place to summon powers strong enough to protect you&amp;nbsp; you and your man. If you are willing to pay the price.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She felt an ache in the pit of her stomach. &amp;quot;We have no money. Nothing at all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;These powers have no use for money.&amp;quot; Flora&amp;#39;s heart pounded. &amp;quot;There are things, however, that can enhance their powers, and they seek those things.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What could we have that they would want?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled. &amp;quot;A powerful and sometimes terrible daemon wakes at the harvest. When the moon is full on All Hallows Eve, he can be summoned and he would gladly deal with this Lord if we meet his price.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What is his price?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This daemon is a virile one; he thrives on virgins and one who gives herself willingly increases his power. Magic is give and take, so, after he takes her maidenhood, he will grant one request if it is something suiting his nature.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;His nature?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He is a warrior and a virile male. He won&amp;#39;t make you wealthy, but if you ask, he will see your enemy off to a gruesome death.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora shuddered. &amp;quot;I just want him to leave us alone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman smiled. &amp;quot;Ah, but making his death terrible is my price for using my magic to help you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flora felt her world spinning. She had refused Cecil her virginity before marriage countless times. She&amp;#39;d wanted to give it to him on their marriage bed. And now giving it to a daemon seemed to be their only chance. &amp;quot;Is that the only offering he&amp;#39;ll accept?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, it is. And, if we summon him he will take your virginity whether you are willing or not. By being willing, however, you can demand he grant this favor. Without his help, sooner or later the Lord&amp;#39;s men will capture you. And then...&amp;quot; her voice trailed off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knew the woman was right. If she asked his opinion, Cecil would choose death, even a painful one, but that was foolish. She had to be strong for them both. &amp;quot;If I agree, what about Cecil? He will say no.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That much I can deal with. I will put your lover under a spell that will prevent him from knowing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then I will do it.&amp;quot;" />
