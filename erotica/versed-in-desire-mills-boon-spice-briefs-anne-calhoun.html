  <title>Versed in Desire (Mills &amp; Boon Spice Briefs) - Anne Calhoun</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Tell me what you want and it&#39;s yours. &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Corryn meets Luke at her new boss&#39;s party, their attraction is instant and electric. He&#39;s ready to give her any pleasure she desires, but Luke is a company vice president, her boss&#39;s best friend and completely off-limits. Refusing his offer is the most difficult choice she&#39;s ever had to make, made even harder by his continued seduction at the office and the fact that she hasn&#39;t been able to write poetry, her favorite pastime, since denying herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Corryn is desperate to have Luke but she&#39;s all too aware of the risks of giving in to temptation. But after months of denial, she knows she must choose: end their flirtation for good or surrender to the inevitable. . .&lt;/p&gt;
