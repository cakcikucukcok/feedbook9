  <title>Lusting After Mommy - James Hawthorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Son&amp;#39;s have lusted after their moms since the first day they had sexual thoughts. Some moms and sons have acted upon their desires. And never looked back. Here is a collection of 4 stories of mothers and sons ignoring all boundaries and embracing the sexual desires between them. You&amp;#39;ll never look at your mom in the same way again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I fumbled in the dusty cupboard behind the kitchen for the vacuum cleaner as mom peered round the door, &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s an ancient story the foretells the fortunes of a man who can work a vacuum cleaner&amp;quot; she laughed to herself, I fought off an imaginary spider and clambered back out of the cupboard with the cleaner. &amp;quot;Funny, yeah.&amp;quot; And I stomped off. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll get the kettle on. Have a rest in a bit&amp;quot; mom called after me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I got some biscuits out too. Let&amp;#39;s put the TV on for a bit&amp;quot; I grabbed my coffee and followed mom into the lounge. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s an old western I want to watch, so, put your feet up. Thank you for doing your room, I do appreciate it&amp;quot; mom and I cuddled up on the couch as mom flicked on to the channel that Iwo Jima film was about to start, it felt so good against mom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom was falling asleep in my arms again as the credits began to roll on the film and I didn&amp;#39;t want the moment to end, I kissed mom on the forehead and tried to softly climb out of the cuddle and was hoping to get a blanket, but she stirred and kissed my cheek, looking at me through tired eyes, she lifted her hand and softly brushed my hair over my ear with her fingers, &amp;#39;oh Chris, I&amp;#39;m sorry, I thought you were your dad . &amp;#39; her hand felt so good just resting against my ear, I slowly leant forward and kissed mom, softly and intentionally and she held me against her as her lips sought mine and we kissed, our tongues on each others tongues, tiredness quickly falling away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom was now kneeling on the couch as she kissed me, I stood up and she reached out a hand, running over my crotch, my growing cock, growing for my mom, &amp;quot;um, I . . . Uh. .&amp;quot; Mom pulled my pajama trousers down and smiled up at me. &amp;quot;Honey, you tell me to stop any time you want, but I think I did that, didn&amp;#39;t I?&amp;quot; Lost in the lust of the moment, I caressed mom&amp;#39;s face with one hand and lowered my boxers with my other and mom licked her lips, &amp;quot;you can think I&amp;#39;m dad if you want?&amp;quot; Mom raised herself up and kissed me, my cock pressing into her belly, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d rather think that you are my son&amp;quot; she took my hand and put it on her nightie covered boob and kissed me again.&lt;br /&gt;
