  <title>Taken - Charlotte Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was just a prank I didn&#39;t want to be a part of. I never meant to hurt anyone, least of all Johann Weir. You wouldn&#39;t know that he sells literature for a living. He has these wild eyes&amp;#8212;eyes that light something up in me&amp;#8212;and he must be twice as big as me with strong, warm hands. Hands I try not to imagine&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;everywhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He scares me. And thrills me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, the deed is done, and I have to face the consequences. He says he just wants to hold me here until the police come, but it&#39;s been hours and I&#39;m still here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chained to a pipe in his back room like a prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only person I have to talk to is Johann, and all I have to say are secrets I didn&#39;t know I was keeping. Dark, shameful secrets&amp;#8212;secrets that involve the metal around my wrist and him standing over me. But I can&amp;#8217;t stop. I need him to know everything. I need&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johann has his own secrets&amp;#8212;ones he wants to tell me too. And more than anything, I want to listen. And maybe, before he sends me away, he&amp;#8217;ll punish me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a little.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just enough.&lt;/p&gt;" />
