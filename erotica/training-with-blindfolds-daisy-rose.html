  <title>Training With Blindfolds - Daisy Rose</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
She crosses paths with him again shortly after. Only this time, there&amp;#39;s nothing accidental about the ropes, blindfold, and men he has prepared for her...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m almost done,&amp;quot; I spluttered, as if that wasn&amp;#39;t obvious, as if he was in here by accident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The crawling sensation of danger made the hair on my neck stand on end. There was nothing accidental about him being in the small bathroom stall with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stepped into the tight space and closed the door behind him. I stopped breathing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t this what you what?&amp;quot; he growled, his voice so deep it went straight down my spine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mr. Siegel, I think you may have misunderstood something,&amp;quot; I started, trying to find a way out of the stall. The lavatory wasn&amp;#39;t big enough for one person, let alone two. All my shifting around only amounted to me rubbing my body against his, worsening the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had backed up the most I could, the back of my legs hitting the seat of the toilet, which had the lid closed down. He was leaning in toward me, not touching me, but close enough for me to smell the hint of cologne on his body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was moving toward me and my eyes fell from his chest to the growing hardness between his legs. I licked my lips despite myself. What was he doing? What was I doing? I should be shouting for help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I opened my mouth to try and tell him to get out of the way, but he put his palm on my parted lips, stopping the words from escaping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My tongue darted out, tasting the salt off his palm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In panic, I grabbed his fingers and tried to pry his hand away, but he was too strong. I twisted with no effect. His free hand reached behind my head and gripped my hair tight, yanking my head back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I exhaled sharply from the pain of having my hair pulled back to roughly. I reached behind my head to free myself from him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be very quiet, Stephanie,&amp;quot; he warned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fight or flight punched me in the gut and I bit down on his hand as hard as I could. My tongue picked up a slight hint of metal, letting me know that I had bit hard enough to draw blood. Good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pulled back with a hiss and glared at me so furiously that I thought he was going to hurt me. There was something else beneath those eyes, a deep-rooted desire that almost burned with it&amp;#39;s intensity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Listen, I-&amp;quot; I never managed to finish that sentence. His lips were on mine in an instant, suffocating me with the passion of his desire. His tongue found its way into my parted lips, his tongue picking up the taste of his own blood. His skin was so warm it hummed against mine. I was distracted by the pain of his hand tangled in my hair, pulling me head back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stay still,&amp;quot; he said. I didn&amp;#39;t know if it was the sound of his voice or the way he looked at me, but I stilled. His voice flushed my body hot, and then cold and his eyes enthralled me as if in a trance. It was inhuman, the effect this man had on me. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to hurt you,&amp;quot; he purred, smooth, like French roast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shuddered as he leaned in for another kiss. This time, I didn&amp;#39;t try to fight him. Instead, I kissed him back, tasting the bittersweet of his coffee on his tongue. I struggled between terror and deep, unfamiliar arousal." />
