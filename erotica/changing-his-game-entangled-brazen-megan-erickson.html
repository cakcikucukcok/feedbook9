  <title>Changing His Game (Entangled Brazen) - Megan Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marley Lake is no stranger to awkwardness, but getting caught watching a dirty GIF by the company&#39;s hot new IT guy exceeds even &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; standards. That is, until she realizes he&#39;s as turned on by it as she is. But with a big promotion on the line, she refuses to let her current dry spell be her downfall. Maybe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin Rivers has no business lusting after the irresistible editor of &lt;i&gt;Gamers Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. He&#39;s a secret partner in the business-and technically Marley&#39;s boss. One look at that GIF, though, and he&#39;s ready to install a whole lot more than just software...as long as she never finds out who he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But reality&#39;s not as virtual as it seems, and when Austin&#39;s identity jeopardizes Marley&#39;s promotion, he has to change his game or risk losing the only woman with the cheat code to his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Gamers series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Changing His Game     &lt;br&gt;Book #2 Playing For Her Heart &lt;br&gt;Book #3 Tied to Trouble &lt;br&gt;Book #4 Leveling The Field&lt;/p&gt;" />
