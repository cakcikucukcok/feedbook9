      <meta name="description" content="OMG…SO HOT!
Everybody remembers their first time. But when you&#39;re a little brat and that first time is with the prince of the house…well, that&#39;s definitely something you&#39;ll never forget!
Come and get them!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
&quot;Have you got anything exciting planned for my 18th birthday?&quot; Emma asks her stepbrother.
&quot;Well,&quot; Bradley says. &quot;I was thinking of maybe picking up some fireworks later. We could set them off in the backyard.&quot;
&quot;Oh, Bradley, that would be wonderful!&quot; Emma says, giving him a big hug.
&quot;You know what?&quot; Emma says to her stepbrother. &quot;I have a feeling this is going to be my best birthday yet.&quot;
&quot;And you know something?&quot; Bradley says in response. &quot;I have a feeling that you&#39;re right.&quot;
They smile at one another.
Emma knows that it&#39;s not her stepbrother&#39;s fault his shirts always cling to his muscular body, showing off his chest and abs. It&#39;s not his fault she&#39;s been really horny lately, even though she knows that having thoughts about him is wrong. But she can&#39;t deny her body&#39;s reactions: whenever she sees or thinks about Bradley, she gets a little wet deep inside.
Bradley&#39;s been horny lately…and it&#39;s been for Emma, of all people.
She&#39;s got a perfect body, and ever since she turned 18 Emma hasn&#39;t been shy about showing it off. All Bradley can think about is introducing her to the wonders of sex. It&#39;s enough to drive him crazy.
&quot;So, do you feel any older?&quot; Bradley asks his little sister. Emma thinks for a second.
&quot;Well,&quot; she admits. &quot;I&#39;ve definitely noticed that I&#39;ve been having, um…more adult thoughts lately.&quot;
&quot;More adult thoughts?&quot; Bradley asks, raising an eyebrow. Emma blushes a little as she takes a step towards him.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she says in a soft voice. &quot;More…sexy thoughts.&quot;
&quot;Man,&quot; Bradley says, shaking his head. &quot;I envy you, Emma.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; she asks. &quot;Why do you envy me?&quot;
&quot;Because you&#39;re young! You can do whatever you want in your life. Me, I&#39;m stuck at my job. I just wish I could escape from it, even for a little bit.&quot;
And to his surprise he sees his stepsister looking up at him, a strange look in her eyes and a smile on her lips.
&quot;I&#39;ll bet I can think of something that can help you escape,&quot; she says in a soft voice." />
