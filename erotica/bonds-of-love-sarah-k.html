  <title>Bonds of Love - Sarah K</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;If you loved Fifty Shades of Grey¸ you’ll LUST after this true story of dominance, submission, lust and temptation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah K is like any normal woman. She lives in a quiet suburban town. She has a couple of kids; a steady job as a writer. But behind the bedroom door she enters a different world – a world sexual power play and erotic control. For Sarah K is a submissive, and she willingly surrenders her body to the passions of a dominant lover.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still reeling after ending things with her first dom, Max, Sarah finds herself unable to move on. As Max had warned, once you’ve tasted the forbidden fruits of dominance and submission, you can’t go back. So when Sarah meets Alex – a tall, handsome man who shares her erotic desires – she finds herself cast under the dark spell of pleasure and pain once more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they explore one another, like an addiction, Sarah begins to crave Alex – his touch, his breath, his smell. Shocked at the emotions he has awakened within her, Sarah tells herself this is just lust. She had learnt the hard way that falling in love is one line that can’t be crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So why does it feel so wrong when Max re-enters her life, determined to possess her once more? Should she admit her true feelings for Alex, and potentially expose herself to the worst pain of all – heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hotter than fiction, this intoxicating and explosive true story will set your pulse racing as Sarah K strips away the mask to reveal what it’s really like to be a sexual submissive.&lt;/p&gt;
