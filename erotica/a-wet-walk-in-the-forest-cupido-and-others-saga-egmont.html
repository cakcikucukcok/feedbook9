      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s nothing like the fresh air in the mountains, waves lapping against the shore, the wind caressing your breast, the water touching your sex...
This is a collection of erotic short stories from Cupido. The collection contains the following stories:
&quot;They reached the top. The mist was impenetrable. He knew what she was thinking of.&quot; - A Mountain Hike by Julia
&quot;He lay dozing on the terrace in the Easter sunshine. She rubbed sun lotion into his butt. She&#39;d fantasised about this for ages.&quot; - A Cabin Trip in the Easter Sunshine by B, Østlandet
&quot;He found her in the forest. But did he have the right to tie her up with her legs spread?&quot; - Stranger Danger by Hege and Morten
&quot;They were on a cabin trip with her friend. They had to make love in secret - while her friend went to get some water. It took five minutes.&quot; - Just a Quickie by E.W., Trondheim
&quot;They owned a farm with a thousand acres of forest. Perfect for picking cranberries dressed as Adam and Eve.&quot; - Picking Cranberries by Tobben" />
