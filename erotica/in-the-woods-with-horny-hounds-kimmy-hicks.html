  <title>In The Woods with Horny Hounds - Kimmy Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mindy has gone on a solitary camping trip in the woods where she grew up, despite the ranger&#39;s warnings of a pack of feral dogs on the loose. As night falls, a lone hound finds her camp, but he is anything but menacing. She soon finds herself on all fours, alone in the woods, and in a more intimate position with the dog than she had ever intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I giggled, remembering the days when my uncle&#39;s dog used to do that and everyone would laugh. My smile faded though, when I felt my ass being poked by the animal&#39;s hard member. I looked behind me and saw that the dog&#39;s cock was fully erect, pink and engorged, and poking around for a hole to fuck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself putting my ass higher in the air, and spreading my legs, making it easier for the dog to stumble into my pussy. Just one thrust in, I thought. That&#39;s all. I just want to feel something in there." />
