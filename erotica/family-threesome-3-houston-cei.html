~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although Cesar was a fabulous culinary artist and seemed to Jocelyn like an honest man with a pleasing personality, she sensed he had a deep emotional problem. She wanted to talk to him alone and chose a particular evening when she knew he would be finishing his work for the day. As he was getting ready to close up, she ordered a meal and asked him to join her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cesar,&amp;quot; she said with a bright smile. &amp;quot;You have been a wonderful friend in welcoming me to this beautiful island. You have been like a chaperone and guardian. I don&amp;#39;t mean to be personal or offend you in any way, but if I can help you with whatever is bothering you, please allow me to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is it that obvious?&amp;rdquo; he asked with a faint grin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jocelyn returned the grin with an affirmative nod of her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a cry baby, but since you are concerned, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some personal things with you,&amp;rdquo; Cesar said. &amp;ldquo;Since I was a child, I wanted to be a chef in a fancy restaurant. My parents could not afford formal training for me but I read books and cooked at home. Whenever there was a wedding or any other event, I jumped at the opportunity to cook. I was certain that my big chance would come, perhaps in Cebu and when I met Jasmine, we shared my ambition together, but nothing ever happened. We have our one and only small child. We wanted to have more children but that may never happen, and I am stuck here in this tiny little place where I work for twelve hours a day for a very small salary. Jasmine expected so much more out of life, but I have not given it to her and now we seldom touch&amp;hellip;if you know what I mean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I think I know what your mean,&amp;rdquo; Jocelyn said. &amp;ldquo;Your love-life is less than robust and you are disenchanted with your station in life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right on, Jocelyn but there&amp;rsquo;s another thing:&amp;nbsp; whenever I try to please my wife, she is disinterested and has even suggested what she calls &amp;ldquo;experimentation&amp;rdquo; and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m ready to handle that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At that point, Jocelyn could not help but recall the many affairs she had experienced after her divorce. They all came to an end without total fulfillment, but nevertheless, they were exciting and she accepted them as important in her personality and character development. She assumed correctly that Cesar&amp;rsquo;s wife wanted to bring another person into their bed and that whomever they chose could be of either sex. What could it hurt if I am that person? she asked herself. When she saw the sadness in Cesar&amp;rsquo;s countenance as he spoke, Jocelyn made a quick decision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, Cesar, I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a marriage counselor or a sex therapist, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the &amp;lsquo;experimentation&amp;rsquo; that your wife wants would be harmful to your marriage. You and your wife are beautiful people and I want very much for you and her stay together. I have an idea and the downside risk seems very small to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cesar was stunned and speechless as he listened to Jocelyn&amp;rsquo;s suggestion for a menage a trois with herself as the third person. He assured Jocelyn that he found her to be a very attractive woman..." />
