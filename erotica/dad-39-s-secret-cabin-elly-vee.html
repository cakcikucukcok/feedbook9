  <title>Dad&#39;s Secret Cabin - Elly Vee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Ed buys a cabin as a weekend getaway for him and his wife Irene. Maybe they can spark things back up between them. Irene is used to a life of luxury and isn&amp;#39;t that excited about a rundown cabin in the middle of nowhere. Ed promises to fix the cabin up to her standards and gets unexpected help from his daughter Emma. Attention shifts when Emma and Ed have a drink of Jack and give in to their burning desires for each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Emma followed me into the back room. The mattress didn&amp;rsquo;t look too bad standing up against the wall. I picked it up and laid it flat on the floor. Lie down and tell me if it&amp;rsquo;s any good. Emma did as her father said and lied down on her back to feel the mattress. As she laid down her dress hiked up towards her crotch. Her panties were showing. I felt my dick getting restless by the site of my little girl laying down in front of me. I positioned myself next to her and thought it was now or never. Honey, you look so beautiful. Emma smiled back and leaned in for a kiss. However, she didn&amp;rsquo;t just give me a peck on the lips like she normally did, but slipped her tongue inside my mouth. She tasted so sweet as I rolled my tongue around hers. &amp;ldquo;Daddy, will you be my first?&amp;quot;" />
