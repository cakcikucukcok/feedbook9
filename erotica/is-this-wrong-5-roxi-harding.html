  <title>Is This Wrong #5 - Roxi Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care what they say. I want you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are 22 brand new stories about those princes of the house who just can&amp;#39;t take their hands off of their little brats!&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;#39;t wait, read it all now!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The dryer whirs against Marcus&amp;#39;s bum as he leans on it. Sofia, his 18-year old stepsister, had just put a load of damp clothes into it and now he&amp;#39;s taking a break from their day of doing laundry together.&lt;br /&gt;
Sofia looks over at her stepbrother as he works. She really likes the time they spend together. He catches her watching him and she gives him a smile&amp;mdash;something innocent, not too flirty.&lt;br /&gt;
He gives her the same sort of smile back.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey Marcus?&amp;quot; Sofia asks. &amp;quot;Do you might giving my shoulders a bit of a rub? They&amp;#39;re kind of stiff.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; Marcus replies, and he steps up behind his little sister, massaging the muscles beside her neck.&lt;br /&gt;
Sofia moans, closing her eyes at the wonderful feeling. Her stepbrother&amp;#39;s hands are like magic. After a few minutes she turns around and he lets go of her. She looks up into his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That was great, thank you,&amp;quot; she says in a sultry voice. Marcus doesn&amp;#39;t look away from her stare.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It was my pleasure,&amp;quot; he says, and Sofia smiles at him.&lt;br /&gt;
Marcus&amp;#39;s heart won&amp;#39;t seem to stop beating.&lt;br /&gt;
He wants to step back from his stepsister but he can&amp;#39;t seem to be able to. He&amp;#39;s stuck where he is, and she&amp;#39;s not moving away either. Does she want him as much as he wants her? From the look of her eyes as she stares up at him, right down to that round ass and tight pussy in between her legs, he&amp;#39;s pretty certain he knows the answer.&lt;br /&gt;
Sofia feels some envy go through her as she looks at her stepbrother.&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s just so robust, you know? So smart and sure of himself. He&amp;#39;s strong, good looking, and down below&amp;hellip;well, he&amp;#39;s certainly got nothing to be ashamed of down below.&lt;br /&gt;
She just wishes she had some of that charisma. As it is right now she&amp;#39;s just some little sister, barely an adult, who is in desperate need of some real life experience.&lt;br /&gt;
Who would ever want her?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know, Marcus,&amp;quot; Sofia says to her stepbrother.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;br /&gt;
Sofia chews on her lower lip, unsure of how to go on." />
