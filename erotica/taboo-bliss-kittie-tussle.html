  <title>Taboo Bliss - Kittie Tussle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taboo Bliss is three taboo tales of erotic romance. Three young women finding taboo bliss in the arms of the man of the house. In &amp;quot;Reunited&amp;quot;, Erica returns to her stepfather&amp;#39;s home needing help. He has no problems helping her, but he wants something in return. A trip down memory lane brings back old desires and reignites a flame and before she knows it, she&amp;#39;s sharing his bed for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of first times, &amp;quot;Our Secret&amp;quot; tells the story of Dan and Katrina. Katrina is acting up in school, being a bratty little bitch, but it&amp;#39;s only because she&amp;#39;s craving some attention at home. Dan still isn&amp;#39;t comfortable with his role as the man of the house, but when his wife is away, he&amp;#39;ll figure out how to give Kat what she deeply craves...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our third tale, &amp;quot;Giving In&amp;quot; tells the story of college-girl Sara, who&amp;#39;s taking a camping trip with her stepfather Mark. Sara has been lusting for Mark for a long, long time, and even though they both know it&amp;#39;s wrong, they&amp;#39;re about to give in to their passions." />
