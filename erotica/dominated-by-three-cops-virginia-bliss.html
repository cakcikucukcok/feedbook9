~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was by far the most handsome policeman I&amp;#39;d ever seen, with tousled brown locks and a jawline so sharp you could cut diamonds on it. He looked down at me with dark, dark eyes and flashed me a knowing smile. I felt a little relieved - at least he seemed friendly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So, how are we this evening?&amp;quot; He asked, making light conversation. In all honesty, I just wanted to get the whole situation over and done with. As fun as making small talk with a man of this calibre might be, I was eager to get home, make dinner, and assess the damage done to my bank account by this inevitable ticket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine.&amp;quot; I replied, giving him my classic wide-eyed, innocent look. It probably wasn&amp;#39;t going to do me much good here, but that was neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You were going way too fast, you know.&amp;quot; He began - I nodded, flushing pink at the thought that he might&amp;#39;ve heard me singing from the car as I drove recklessly down this middle-of-nowhere street. I needed to learn to not embarrass myself like this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Too fast. You know - I&amp;#39;m gonna need to call backup. I don&amp;#39;t think I can let you off with just a ticket. These roads are dangerous at night. You could&amp;#39;ve really hurt somebody, you know that?&amp;quot; He droned on. The way he talked made it sound as though he wasn&amp;#39;t about to ruin my life. I knew not what he meant, but I assumed I&amp;#39;d be put in holding or something awful of the sort." />
