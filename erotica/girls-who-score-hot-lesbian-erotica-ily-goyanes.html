  <title>Girls Who Score: Hot Lesbian Erotica - Ily Goyanes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even though they may not get a lot of action on the field after high school and college, girl jocks always manage to see a lot of action off the field. Because female athletes have an easy confidence about them, a natural nonchalance, and usually a killer bod, that draws all kinds of women to them &amp;#8211; straight, lesbian, bisexual, curious, questioning, you name it. Women are competitive by nature, whether they play sports or games. Women play hard and love harder. They don&amp;#8217;t just score &amp;#8211; they keep track. Girls Who Score is filled with story after story of complex, intriguing women engaging in all kinds of, ahem, contact sports. Sinclair Sexsmith contributes &quot;A Good Workout&quot; at the gym with lots of hot action in the steam room and Gina Marie has two women boxers going at it in every way in her ever-so-sexy &quot;Blood Lust.&quot; Delilah Devlin&#39;s soccer champs have a very good time in &quot;Playing the Field,&quot; and Elle&#39;s &quot;Game Over&quot; has a cheerleader who &quot;trains&quot; a freshmen each year to serve her every need. Sporty dykes aren&amp;#8217;t always playing ball, so to speak. After all, scuba divers and gym bunnies are in fact athletes and editor Ily Goyanes features lesbian jocks of every stripe in this sweet and sweaty volume." />
