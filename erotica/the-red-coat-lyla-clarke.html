  <title>The Red Coat - Lyla Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Glenn Annah Andersson.  What a handle to be hampered with your entire life. Annah was the farthest thing from masculine that any person could image.  With flashing green eyes, bouncing blond curls, and a bodacious body, no one would suspect this petite bombshell was studying to be a conservation officer or that at home awaited her two small children.&lt;p&gt;  
Enter Lachlan MacGregor, a divorced conservation officer whose daughters death has left his private life a closed topic.  A chance meeting in a crowded hallway starts a series of events rolling out of Annah and Lachlans control.  Annah had forgotten she was a woman with needs. Now she cant seem to concentrate on anything except her raging hormones.  Determined to stop this insanity and get back to the serious business of her life, Annah propositions Lachlan to a single night of delights.  It works too, for a while.&lt;p&gt;  
The attraction between the two cant be ignored.  While they privately struggle with their attraction a mountain rescue goes bad and an officer is killed.  Someone has been illegally baiting a cougar as well.  Lachlan vows to protect Annah and her family and make them his own." />
