      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack Harnette is about to die. But what comes next, he could never have guessed. Join Jack on his journey from the nightclubs of Hell to the courthouse of Heaven and the political steps of Mt. Olympus to a gambling den in Tauterus.

The Politics of Being Dead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Rabia Tanveer for Readers&#39; Favorite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Politics of Being Dead by J. Higgins is the story of a mans journey to the land of the dead and what he discovers. Jack Harnette could never have known what would happen to him after his death? Is there a life after death? Do you walk into the light? Well, you can imagine his surprise when he found out that there is a lot of politics after you die. There is so much going on around him and he has no idea how he can digest it. There are no religions, but there are a lot of gods and all of them want something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Hell has nightclubs, why would someone want to go to Heaven where there are courthouses ready to judge you? Why didnt anyone tell us that there was a gambling den in Tartarus? Although we all knew that Mount Olympus has a lot of politics, after death you get to have a front row seat to the show. Jack is going through an afterlife where there are porn stars, politicians, girls who love to party, gods, angels and demons. And oh, there are also reapers roaming around you like there is nothing wrong. When you are surrounded by all that, how can you make a decision or judge what is good for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a thoroughly entertaining novel. I loved the fact that Higgins showed a different side of the afterlife. Usually authors make it grim and so disturbing. Higgins also made it grim and disturbing, but he made it entertaining and a whole lot of fun. This is a novel that makes you want to read it again and again. An imaginative story that makes you smile a lot.&lt;/p&gt;" />
