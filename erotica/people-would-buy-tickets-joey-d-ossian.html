  <title>People Would Buy Tickets - Joey D. Ossian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%; color: black;&quot;&gt;People Would Buy Tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%; color: black;&quot;&gt; is my first attempt at creating
fiction.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Do not be misled into thinking
I am getting tremendously creative here.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Realistic fiction becomes fiction only because I have changed the names
of people and the titles of the places where it was necessary.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I am still telling stories that really
happened, only embellishing where I lack details or think it would be more
interesting.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The part of this book that
is really fictional and dreamt up is in the descriptions and actions of the
main characters, but I am still using stories from, and characteristics of,
people I have known personally.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;That
said, Heck and Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%;&quot;&gt; are
wholly fictional characters, and are not meant to symbolize or represent
anybody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%; color: black;&quot;&gt;When I began this
project, the title of the book was, &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Count
Is Clear&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;After careful
consideration, that title works only if you are familiar with correctional
jargon.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I had intended some word play
with the term count, and a main character, Count, but it does not work if you
are not already familiar with the term as it applies to corrections, and the
character.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The title that I decided on, &lt;i style=&quot;&quot;&gt;People Would Buy Tickets&lt;/i&gt;, comes from a
co-worker, who does not want his name mentioned here.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%; color: black;&quot;&gt;Many of you know my
previous work, and realize that I was simply writing about things that really
happened.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There is not much writing
talent in regurgitating, just a skill for translating real life to paper.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The primary characters are all fictional, as
is much of their background, but the inter-woven humorous short stories are mostly
factual, if only slightly embellished events related to me by co-workers and my
own experiences while working in the corrections field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
