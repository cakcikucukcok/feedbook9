  <title>Ravished By The Spies - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Queen and Country, Felicia must be prepared to sacrifice anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tasked by her shadowy spymaster employer to deliver a secret message, she finds herself taken captive by three foreign agents. Her life is in danger, but first they intend to use her for their pleasure. To fulfill her mission she must submit to their twisted passions, and learn to embrace both pleasure and pain.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Inside the door was a ramshackle set of stairs, the wood stained dark with use. I climbed to the top, where there was another door. I pushed it open and stepped inside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The room that I found myself in was low-ceiling and poorly lit, a couple of lanterns spluttering feebly on the walls. The roof was supported by two timbers beams, one of which was sagging alarmingly. But it was the inhabitants of the room who alarmed me more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leaning against the wall was a small, rat-like man. His squinting eyes were sly and feral, and he had a neatly groomed moustache. Sitting at the table was a refined looking man, better dressed than the other two. Although his features were bland, I did not like the look of him. There was an aura of danger about him that made goose-bumps appear on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both men were looking at me curiously, and I opened my mouth to greet them. But at that moment, strong arms clamped around me from behind, and my intended salutation turned into a hoarse yell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Let go of me!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The brute ignored me, half carrying me over to a chair. He made me sit on it, then snarled at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t move, or I&amp;#39;ll break your bloody neck.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believed him. I stayed stock still." />
