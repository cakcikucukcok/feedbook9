  <title>Whole Lesbian Sex Stories: Erotica for Women - Felice Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Confessions of an Erotica Reader I love lesbian sex. I love talking about sex. I love mentally undressing the sexy women in my life. I love planning what I&amp;#8217;m going to do when my partner gets home. I love having sex, curling my hand inside my partner and feeling the intensity of her pleasure. I love her hand curled inside me, the experience of utterly losing control. I love it all. Outside of actual fucking, my favorite kinky activity is reading erotic stories. I love crawling inside another person&amp;#8217;s imagination. What hot situation will she dream up? Who are the characters, where in the story will they come together, and what will they do once they get there? I&amp;#8217;m a voyeur. By reading erotica I get to &amp;#8220;watch&amp;#8221; hot women having sex. Sometimes an erotic story presents me with new ideas, and sometimes an erotic stories causes me to revisit an erotic scenario or activity I hadn&amp;#8217;t entertained recently. You might say that reading erotica keeps me fresh. No surprise, since I am a founding publisher of Cleis Press, which has published thousands of them. As a sex educator and sex coach, I deploy erotica as the secret tool for women who feel stuck or emptied of desire. Read sex stories, indulge your fetish, get your kink on, discover your heat, I say. Since publication of The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us, I have heard from many, many women, grateful to have a sex guide written just for us&amp;#8212;and packed with information and suggestions, and, as one woman wrote, &amp;#8220;inspiration, affirmation, and illumination.&amp;#8221; Think of Whole Lesbian Sex Stories as the companion volume to The Whole Lesbian Sex Book. Here are my favorite graphic depictions of lesbian sex&amp;#8212;stories of urgent sex, kinky sex, vanilla sex, self-pleasuring sex, cross-dressing sex, public sex, butch/femme sex, voyeuristic sex, BDSM, edgy sex, passionate, dirty sex. It&amp;#8217;s all here." />
