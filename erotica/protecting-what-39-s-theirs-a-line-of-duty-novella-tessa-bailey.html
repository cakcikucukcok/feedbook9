  <title>Protecting What&#39;s Theirs (A Line of Duty Novella) - Tessa Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ginger Peet has never regretted leaving Nashville with her sister and their life-sized statue of Dolly Parton. Now she&#39;s settled in Chicago with Lieutenant Derek Tyler, spending her nights pressed against every inch of his hard, dominating, and panty-meltingly-hot body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s nowhere Derek would rather be than reminding Ginger--thoroughly and exquisitely--that she belongs to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. But then trouble hits the streets of Chicago. The kind of bust the old-school boys call a &quot;widow-maker.&quot; To keep Ginger safe, Derek&#39;s forced to shut her out and keep himself away from her luscious body, or risk losing her forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ginger has just been presented with some, er, &lt;i&gt;unexpected&lt;/i&gt; news. And right now, it&#39;s best she keeps that news to herself. Because Derek stands to lose far more than he knows, until he takes the law--and Ginger--into his own hands one last time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released as part of the Lovers Unmasked anthology. Now available individually!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Line of Duty series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s His&lt;br&gt;* Officer Off Limits&lt;br&gt;* Asking for Trouble&lt;br&gt;* Staking His Claim&lt;br&gt;* Protecting What&#39;s Theirs&lt;/p&gt;" />
