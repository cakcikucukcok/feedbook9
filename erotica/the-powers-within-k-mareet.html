  <title>The Powers Within - K. Mareet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peri Delants life is gooda wonderful home, loving family, interesting friends (both human and dragon), and a sexy husband, who shares her need to occasionally escape the normal routines of daily life. Visiting his brothers home is always an adventure and fun. Discovering the ancient dragon Sondhill and the elves is exciting. Waking up in a warded GnaGrattkkan prison with giants for guards and an obnoxious dwarf next door isnt. For many of the inmates, freedom and home have no meaning, so after getting rescued, they make them one. While the giants and shunned elves embrace New Home, Ned yearns to find his old one and more dwarven for his own hope of a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peri, Vanik, Sara, Jonas, and five dragons help Ned search and provide support for Sondhill when he returns to his previously decimated hold after over three thousand years of absence. While exploring an abandoned hold, they encounter an evil shadow. The ensuing battle to kill it leaves some wounded and all weary. Then by chance, the nearby mountain they take refuge in turns out to be Neds old home. Even better, they discover that three of his family survived the massacre fifty years ago, but four are not enough to rebuild his clan, so they continue the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gods grant them success, and soon Sondhills not the only one restoring his old clan with eager volunteers. Their choice of mates might be questionable but whatever makes them happy . . . right?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery to celebrate is Saras surprise pregnancy. The one Peris not so happy about is the suspicion shes not going crazy after all and that there really is something hitching a ride in her well of power. Something powerful that hates evil as much as she does. So thats good . . . isnt it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
