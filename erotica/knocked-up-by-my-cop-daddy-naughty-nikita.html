  <title>Knocked Up By My Cop Daddy - Naughty Nikita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I knew I&amp;rsquo;d fucked up bad when daddy threw me in the back of the cruiser, flicked on the lights and took me down to the station. Sheesh, it was just a bit of alcohol, daddy! It&amp;rsquo;s not like I killed someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But daddy made a deal with me. Carry his baby or go to jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He flicked off the lights, pulled into the darkened park next to station and taught me a lesson I&amp;rsquo;d never forget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This is your punishment. It&amp;#39;s either this or go to jail.&amp;quot; He said gruffly, his face inches from mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I melted when I smelled his after shave. Deep down inside, deeper than I&amp;#39;d ever admit, I - like every other girl out there - had a thing for my daddy. He was tall, strong and VERY handsome. That he was a badass cop just completed the picture of him being a dominant alpha in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, but...&amp;quot; My heart fluttered in my chest as I thought about what my daddy wanted to do to me. Carry his baby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Haven&amp;#39;t you always wanted a baby?&amp;quot; He breathed hotly as his hands caressed my cheek and stroked my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nodded as a tear streaked down my face. &amp;quot;But you&amp;#39;re my daddy!&amp;quot; I protested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Who better?&amp;quot; He kissed me again, his hot lips mashing against mine. This time instead of pulling away, I wrapped my long arms around his large, muscular chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did have a point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes, we&amp;#39;d hastily disposed of our clothes and began steaming up the windows. I giggled when daddy kissed my small breasts. He took a whole one in his mouth and began to suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m...&amp;quot; I turned my head and looked out the window, not being able to meet daddy&amp;#39;s gaze. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a virgin...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s okay,&amp;quot; he said as he kissed my breasts and neck and blew silly bubbles on my belly. I giggled and laughed and kicked my legs. I felt so good being taken by my daddy. What had I been thinking? He was strong, experienced, handsome and according to the bulge in his underwear, extremely well-hung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tentatively reached out and touched his massive cock and quickly pulled my hand back. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s so big, daddy!&amp;quot; I exclaimed, giggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He groaned in answer and pulled me closer to him." />
