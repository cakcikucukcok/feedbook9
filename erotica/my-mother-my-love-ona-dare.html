  <title>My Mother, My Love - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s 1868, and the Civil War has taken its toll on the denizens of the South. What is there to do but endeavor to rebuild and make a living from the soil? Becka, and her son, Clayton, work like dogs to keep food on the table. Her husband has been gone for six years and it&amp;rsquo;s just been her and Clay. No one else. Just the two of them, alone with no one around for miles&amp;hellip;and so desperately in need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Clay falls in his bed fully clothed, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t move an inch. Soon I hear little puffs of air escaping his lips and I know he&amp;rsquo;s asleep. As tired as I am, I need to bathe, and suddenly the thought of cold well water makes the day&amp;rsquo;s burdens seem more palatable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stripping down to the skin, I quietly grab a cake of soap and a towel, and walk to the well. Cranking the bucket up to the top, I run my fingers through the water and sigh in appreciation. Taking the dipper in hand, I wet my body and begin soaping up, loving the feel of my own hands running over my skin, feeling my nipples harden at the pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Moon tonight and it&amp;rsquo;s so bright that I can hardly see the stars twinkling in the sky. I wash my hair and long for the feel of the icy well water as it splashes over my head while rinsing out the soap. Oh, God, it feels so good. So good that I bring another bucket up from the well and strain my arms in raising it over my head, letting it sluice down my body once again. And when I open my eyes&amp;hellip;there is Clay, standing on the porch. Naked and aroused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come on over and I&amp;rsquo;ll bathe you, son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t mind if I do. You certainly look happy after having a bath. I bet it felt great, huh, Ma?&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s giving me a salacious grin that should be a warning signal that I&amp;rsquo;m about to do the unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should chide him for not minding his manners. For exposing himself to his own mother, but I don&amp;rsquo;t. Instead, some part of my brain says it will only be a mother bathing her beloved son. That it will only be this one time. That it&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s only natural.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clay brings another bucket of water up from the well, and dumps it over his head. His cock shrivels a bit and I smile. &amp;ldquo;Bring another bucket up, son.&amp;rdquo; He does and I wet the wash cloth and soap it again. Where shall I start? Turning him around, I start at his neck and wash slowly but carefully, making sure he will be clean when I&amp;rsquo;m done...down his back, watching as goose flesh runs down his spine&amp;hellip;and then down to his muscled bottom&amp;hellip;where I wash between his cheeks. Slowly, oh so slowly, I wash, and Clay cannot stop himself from thrusting his bottom toward me, and reaching around to hold those cheeks wide open. He loves the stimulation. I have heard that some men do, so I forgo the wash cloth and use my hand on him. His anus is pulsing with need but I will not go there, yet. I don&amp;rsquo;t want him to cum too quickly. His father would always want me to do that for him while he masturbated when it was my time of the month. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take very long for him to reach his climax and it saved me from having to do something else to please him during those times. But not now. Not with Clayton. Rinsing him with another bucket of water, I continue." />
