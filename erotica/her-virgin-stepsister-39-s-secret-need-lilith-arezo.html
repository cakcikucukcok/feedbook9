  <title>Her Virgin Stepsister&#39;s Secret Need - Lilith Arezo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Olivia and Lana Stepford aren&amp;#39;t happy about gaining a sister when their parents marry, especially since Olivia seems to hate the very air Lana breathes. But when Lana discovers a huge secret that may be the clue to Olivia&amp;#39;s attitude towards her, she decides that it&amp;#39;s time for both of them to release their tension... In her case, for the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
The steam filled the small space of the bathroom, fogging the reflective surfaces of the mirrors and glass, condensation settling in the air as she stood beneath the scalding spray of water. The one way to maintain her sanity was to keep her extra addition a secret. Only a select few knew, and she didn&amp;rsquo;t want or need the judging eyes of Miss Goody Two Shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, that meant she couldn&amp;rsquo;t relieve the constant tension that plagued her. It was too risky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tonight was different. She&amp;rsquo;d tried not to, she really did, but she&amp;rsquo;d been so hard and throbbing that she could barely move without the reminder. It was all Lana&amp;rsquo;s fault. God, she was so fucking hot, especially when she was angry. The way her skin flushed, and her eyes darkened, and when she&amp;rsquo;d bent over to retrieve something of Olivia&amp;rsquo;s to throw it on her side of the room, O always caught a glimpse of her firm ass and the flash of puffy folds. Apparently, the nerd didn&amp;rsquo;t wear underwear to bed&amp;mdash;and the knowledge did little to aid Olivia&amp;rsquo;s plight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By now the athlete was pretty sure she picked fights with Lana just to punish herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;d known the moment it had been suggested that they room together that it was a bad idea. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as if she was blind. Her stepsister might have been shy and a little on the awkward bookworm side, but she was gorgeous with sumptuous curves that lured Olivia to the point of salivation and when she wasn&amp;rsquo;t being rude she was actually kind of funny and wicked smart. If Lana had been someone else, anyone else, she would have flirted with her, maybe even have been bold enough to ask her out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It had taken the younger girl awhile to fully accept that she was unique, but the moment she realized just how popular it made her, she quickly adapted. Girls were her weakness, and sex was verging on an addiction. However, Lana was off limits. They were supposed to bond and braid each others&amp;#39;hair while Olivia continued dreaming about kissing her, touching her, and worst of all&amp;mdash; stretching her tightness every night." />
