  <title>Mutation - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Rick Anderson isn&amp;#39;t what you would call a normal teenage boy. No. Here in this world where gifted and nongifted people live side by side. A brother and sister grow closer than what siblings should be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Make love to me brother, you&amp;rsquo;re the only one that I want to be my first,&amp;rdquo; my sister said, in a husky voice. As her feet touched the floor we kissed, fondled, touched each other like wild beasts as our clothes went flying around her room. My eyes ran along my sister&amp;rsquo;s body as she laid underneath her window bathed in that silvery light. Her finger beckoning me to her, her thigh brushed along mine as I kissed down her neck. Her breathing came out in heaves as my lips danced along her skin. Her nails dragged along my back as my lips plucked gently on those hard buds of hers. While at the time my skills were poorly lacking, but I was determined that my sister would remember this night. Her nails scraped my scalp as my breath flowed over her delicious little peach. I felt her squirming on the bed as I became the first to ever taste how sweet my sister was. As I explored my sister the best I could with my very limited skills at the time. I heard her say some very, very erotic things that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep to myself. Trust me she&amp;rsquo;ll kill me if anyone ever found out the words she spoke that night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I looked over my sister&amp;rsquo;s womanhood. Watching how she watched me over the tops of her breasts. The little nod of her head told me it was time. Her eyes studied my face as her hand guided my cock towards her paradise. Biting her lip as my head began to penetrate her, a gasp flew from her lips as her hymen tore. Yet as I looked down in-between my legs I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any blood. Her eyes glistened as she nodded her head for me to inch deeper into her hot canal. If I thought my mother&amp;rsquo;s pussy felt wonderful, Lily&amp;rsquo;s was ten times better as her tight little pussy gripped every inch of me as I slowly pumped my hips. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt my sister by going too fast, too hard, too rough that her virgin womanhood was unprepared to take. So as my body delved into the exquisite feeling of my sister&amp;rsquo;s folds as they hugged my cock. My eyes studied Lily&amp;rsquo;s beautiful face imprinting everything about it to memory. Lily nuzzled my hand as I caressed her cheek. Her eyes glistened in moisture as my thumb brushed along her cheekbone. Her mouth slowly formed into a &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; as her climax begun to build as my rod glided through her wet cunt. Her nipples brushed against my chest as her back arched. Her grip tightened on my arms as I sank my pole deep within her mound. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it, not with the way my sister felt as she came upon my cock. As Lily neared the end of her orgasm, my hold on my own seed broke flooding my sister&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For thirty minutes the two of us never said a word as our sweat soaked bodies rested next to one another. Lily snuggled tightly against me her head resting on my chest, my fingers lightly dancing along her back as the two of us just simply enjoyed the presence of one another. Looking down as her finger traced along the healed wound I got a week ago. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it as I felt myself smiling trying to match that dazzling smile of hers. Lily held me tightly." />
