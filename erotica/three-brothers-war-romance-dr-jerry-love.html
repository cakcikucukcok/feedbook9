  <title>Three Brothers, War, &amp; Romance - Dr. Jerry Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The subject of this fictional novel is the adventurous career of Dan Casey, a talented individual who decided when he was a freshman in high school to pursue a career as a merchant marine officer. As a young adult, he developed numerous sexually active relationships with young ladies who were definitely attracted to him. He, in turn, was also attracted to the young ladies, particularly Pamela McGraw, a strikingly beautiful, statuesque blonde he met while he was a cadet at the Merchant Marine Academy. He soon discovered they shared many common interests, and although he realized marriage was definitely out of the question at the present time because of his anticipated active military duty in WWII, he vowed to keep in touch with her. Some four years later, when they got together again, he knew he loved her so deeply that despite all the romantic escapades he had enjoyed with other young ladies, none of them could hold a candle to Pam.
Immediately after Dan graduated from the Merchant Marine Academy, he was commissioned as an ensign in the US Navy and was assigned as the navigation officer aboard a Destroyer at the beginning of WWII. His ship immediately joined the US Pacific Fleet and was in combat situations in nearly all the major sea battles with the Imperial Japanese Navy. Dans two brothers also served on active duty in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during WWII. After the Japanese surrender, Dan returnee to civilian life and immediately married Pama marriage that formed the foundation for a family of four talented children and the beginning of his career as the president of a vacation cruise line.
After a long and successful career, Dan and Pam enjoyed many happy retirement years together as they spent their winters in their beautiful home in Newport, Rhode Island, overlooking Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. They enjoyed their spring, summer, and fall months at their Montana ranch home where the whole Casey family always got together for summer vacations. The ranch, located in a pristine valley with the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains always in view, provided a setting that was definitely breathtakingly beautiful." />
