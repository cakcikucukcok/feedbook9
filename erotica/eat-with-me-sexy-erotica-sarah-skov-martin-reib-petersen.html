  <title>Eat with Me - Sexy erotica - Sarah Skov, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The ice cream is the final dish. He arranged the dessert beautifully on the plate, but instead of complimenting him, I let my index finger slide into the ice cream. I turn towards him and look into his eyes, and bring my finger to my mouth. I open it slightly and observe how his gaze follows the ice cream. I wrap my lips around my finger and suck it loudly.&quot;
Every night after work Anne comes home to an empty apartment, but that‘s where she feels the most alive. She watches the movements of a young sexy chef in her favorite reality show. She studies the way he kneads dough and how he cooks food with such thoughtfulness and care. She wonders if he‘d show the same care towards her. She imagines is fingers inside of her panties. When she one day gets the chance to meet him in real life she does everything in her power to seduce him...
This short story is published in collaboration with the Swedish filmproducer Erika Lust. Her intention is to depict human nature and diversity through stories of passion, intimacy, lust and love in a fusion of powerful stories and erotica." />
