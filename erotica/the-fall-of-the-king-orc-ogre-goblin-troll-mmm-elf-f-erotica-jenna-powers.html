  <title>The Fall of the King (Orc, Ogre, Goblin, Troll MMM / Elf F Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leila and her compatriots are being protected by the Treants Robyn found while she headed South. Unbeknownst to them, Robyn&#39;s deal for protection requires them to be able to help the Treants procreate. Leila finds out the truth but before she can fully discuss the repercussions of Robyn&#39;s deal they are ambushed by the Horde. To Leila&#39;s horror, an old friend reappears, helping to take them into custody.
Leila awakes to find herself captured by the Lich King himself. She is introduced to a familiar face, who is no longer the person she once knew. The Lich King gloats in victory as he has the various members of the Horde feed Leila and her sister the familiar Goblin potion of lust, better known as the Call of the Krakenos before having them surrounded by the powerful beasts of the Horde. Yet another familiar face shows up to bring down Leila&#39;s spirits even more. Can Leila and the others continue on rebelling against the Horde or is this the end of their adventure?
It is highly recommended though not required that the Realms of War Trilogy 1, 2, 3, and the Realms of War 10 be read prior to reading the Realms of War 11.
Author&#39;s note: All characters depicted in this work of fiction are 18 years of age or older." />
