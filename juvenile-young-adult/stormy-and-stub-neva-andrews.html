  <title>Stormy and Stub - Neva Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jo Barkley already has a reputation as a good horsewoman, but can she prove to Dad that she can handle Stormy and Stub, the team of workhorse colts she wants to drive in the Draft Horse Pull at the Rockville County Fair? While she awaits her chance to drive Stormy and Stub, a neighbor asks her to train his two-year-old colt Scamp. Her pay will be getting to ride the colt the rest of the summer.&lt;p&gt;
Percy, a know-it-all young cowboy from Montana, interrupts Jo&#39;s first training session with Scamp. He whacks the colt on the rump and rides off laughing. Jo tries to control her anger and convince the other members of the Snake Flat Riders Club they need to befriend Percy and try to help him. But Percy&#39;s pranks go from bad to worse. Is Jo&#39;s own faith strong enough to follow Jesus&#39; command to &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself&quot;?&lt;p&gt;
When Jo and her dad go to sign her up for the Draft Horse Pull, she encounters a surprising turn of events. Does God have something better for her?" />
