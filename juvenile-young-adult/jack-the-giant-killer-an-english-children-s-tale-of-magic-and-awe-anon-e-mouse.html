  <title>JACK THE GIANT KILLER - An English Children’s Tale of Magic and Awe - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 302&lt;br /&gt;
In this 302nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Conish/Welsh story of &amp;ldquo;JACK THE GIANT KILLER&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This tale is set during the reign of King Arthur and tells of a young Cornish farmer&amp;#39;s son named Jack who is not only strong but so clever he easily confounds the learned with his penetrating wit. Jack encounters a cattle-eating giant called Cormoran (Cornish: &amp;#39;The Giant of the Sea&amp;#39;) and lures him to his death in a pit trap. Jack is dubbed &amp;#39;Jack the Giant-Killer&amp;#39; for this feat and receives not only the giant&amp;#39;s wealth, but a sword and belt to commemorate the event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the second part, a man-eating giant named Blunderbore vows vengeance for Cormoran&amp;#39;s death and carries Jack off to an enchanted castle. Jack manages to slay Blunderbore and his brother Rebecks. He also frees three ladies held captive in the giant&amp;#39;s castle.&lt;br /&gt;
More adventures follow in England and Wales with Jack using his wit to outfox the Giants everytime and rid the land of the terror the presence the giants bring about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In his adventures Jack collects more magical icons which help achieve invisibility and other super-natural states &amp;ndash; you can see where modern-day video games get their plots from.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In jack&amp;rsquo;s last adventure an elderly man directs him to an enchanted castle belonging to the giant Galigantus, or Galligantua. But what happens next?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is Galigantus Jack&amp;rsquo;s nemisis or does he succeed &amp;ndash; again? If he does succeed are there any Giants left in Britain for Jack to conquer or does he have to go abroad to find more? Or&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;does Jack finally meet his match with a comely maiden, or maybe a beautiful princess?&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#39;re invited to download and read the story to find out what happens to Jack.&lt;br /&gt;
