Ben is obsessed with Harry Potter, presidential history, and recycling. But the two have more in common than they think. They&amp;#8217;re both highly gifted. They&amp;#8217;re both experiencing family turmoil. And they both sit alone at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of one week, Charlotte and Ben&amp;#8212;friends connected only by an online Scrabble game&amp;#8212;will intersect in unexpected ways as they struggle to navigate the turmoil of middle school. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling novel &lt;em&gt;You Go First&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that no matter how hard it is to keep our heads above troubled water, we never struggle alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newbery Medalist Erin Entrada Kelly writes with an authentic, humorous, and irresistible voice. This engaging and character-driven story about growing up and finding your place in the world is for fans of Rebecca Stead and Rita Williams-Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
