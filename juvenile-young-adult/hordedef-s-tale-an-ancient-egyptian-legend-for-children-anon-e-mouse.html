  <title>HORDEDEF’S TALE - An Ancient Egyptian Legend for Children - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 365&lt;br /&gt;
In this 365th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Ancient Egyptian Tale &amp;quot;HORDEDEF&amp;rsquo;S TALE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, in the ancient land of Egypt, the royal son Hordedef then stood forth and spake. He said, &amp;quot;Hitherto hast thou only heard tokens of those who have gone before, and of which no man knoweth their truth But I will show thy majesty a man of thine own days.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And his majesty said, &amp;quot;Who is he, Hordedef?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And the royal son Hordedef answered, &amp;quot;It is a certain man named Dedi, who dwells at Dedsneferu. He is a man of one hundred and ten years old; and he eats five hundred loaves of bread, and a side of beef, and drinks one hundred draughts of beer, unto this day. He knows how to restore the head that is smitten off; he knows how to cause the lion to follow him trailing his halter on the ground; he knows the designs of the dwelling of Tahuti. The majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, the blessed, has long sought for the designs of the dwelling of Tahuti, that he may make the like of them in his pyramid.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And his majesty said, &amp;quot;Thou, thyself, Hordedef, my son, bring him to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
And so Dedi was brough before the king and put to the test&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what a test, to reattach a man&amp;rsquo;s head after it has been cut off&amp;hellip;.! Was Dedi successful you ask and what happened next &amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. But palaces are always filled with intrigue and double-dealing? Was this a matter of deception, or was it real and were there any concealed spies listening to conversations they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hearing? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
