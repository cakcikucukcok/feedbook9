  <title>A Tooth with a Hole - Harriet Steinberg, Atila Jack Sikora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about a little boy whose name is Tim. When he complained to his mother that he&lt;br /&gt;had a pain in his tooth, his mother told him that he must have a cavity, and she is going to take&lt;br /&gt;him to the dentist. When Tim asked what is a cavity, she answered that it is a tooth that has a&lt;br /&gt;hole in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then wanted to find out if his dog or parakeet had a cavity, so he went up to them and tried&lt;br /&gt;to open up his dog&#39;s mouth, but could not see a hole in any of his dog&#39;s teeth. When he couldn&#39;t&lt;br /&gt;find a hole in his dog&#39;s teeth, he went to his parakeet and opened up the parakeet&#39; beak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read this story, you will find out what he discovered about his parakeet and other&lt;br /&gt;animals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
