Richie must find the crystal to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, one of which is an evil dragon. The crystal is also thought to have healing powers when immersed in water. Richie inadvertently discovers the secret of controlling the crystal, but the knowledge makes him a target to those wanting the crystal&#39;s power.This book is the first in a five-part series that chronicles a four-month time travel adventure." />
