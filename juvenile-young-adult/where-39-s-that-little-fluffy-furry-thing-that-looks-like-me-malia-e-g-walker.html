  <title>Where&#39;s That Little Fluffy Furry Thing That Looks Like Me? - Malia E. G. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is this extraordinary gift that all of mankind and the animal kingdom shares and should be enjoyed to the fullest.  Death is an inevitable piece of the puzzle.  Our hearts ultimate purpose of this book is to encourage and give inspiration to animal lovers of all ages to simply know that at the time of a death, your pet actually experiences its own painful grief, as well as shares in yours.  We believe that in this life, we are all spiritually connected and there are unbreakable strands of incredible love that tie us to one another, as well as, the many, many years we have shared with our pets.  When a human loses a loved one, the loss affects everyone and everything.  Humans express their sorrow by crying or showing a myriad of emotions.  This is also true of when a pet loses a loved one, its companion.  It, too, experiences the hurt and pain of the loss and the sheer desperation of missing and longing for their loved ones return.
Malia would like to share Buttercups story with you through his eyes, in hopes of helping all pet-loving humans to assist and love their pets through the extremely painful process of grief until they find healing and happiness again.  Our prayer is that the joy of this wonderful life will be restored to all who have suffered a loss of a beloved pet." />
