  <title>When Zachary Beaver Came to Town - Kimberly Willis Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;National Book Award Winner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The red words painted on the trailer caused quite a buzz around town and before an hour was up, half of Antler was standing in line with two dollars clutched in hand to see the fattest boy in the world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toby Wilson is having the toughest summer of his life. It&#39;s the summer his mother leaves for good; the summer his best friend&#39;s brother returns from Vietnam in a coffin. And the summer that Zachary Beaver, the fattest boy in the world, arrives in their sleepy Texas town. While it&#39;s a summer filled with heartache of every kind, it&#39;s also a summer of new friendships gained and old friendships renewed. And it&#39;s Zachary Beaver who turns the town of Antler upside down and leaves everyone, especially Toby, changed forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With understated elegance, Kimberly Willis Holt tells a compelling coming-of-age story about a thirteen-year-old boy struggling to find himself in an imperfect world. At turns passionate and humorous, this extraordinary novel deals sensitively and candidly with obesity, war, and the true power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Zachary Beaver Came to Town&lt;/i&gt; is the winner of the 1999 National Book Award for Young People&#39;s Literature. This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
