      <meta name="description" content="The hero of all of my short stories is my son, Jean-Charles. He goes a large variety of many different adventures, each one unique. I have chosen the names of my friends and family for each book.
In the story JCs Island Hopping Adventure, JC goes on what seems like a very strange trip, beginning with his journey by sea to the Island of Millport. He does not understand why people should enjoy the &#39;hardship&#39; and work involved with cycling around the island. He seems to be unaware of the joy of such a trip with all its peculiarities. As the day comes to an end he is still none the wiser but finally learns to appreciate different customs." />
