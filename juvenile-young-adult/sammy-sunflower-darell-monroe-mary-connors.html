  <title>Sammy Sunflower - Darell Monroe, Mary Connors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Darrell Monroe has been a radio DJ, vocalist and poet for most of his adult life.
Five years ago, he was driving from Dallas through Oregon on his way to play a gig. While driving on a divided highway in Oregon, he passed a huge tract of sunflowers on his right. As he went by, he glanced to his left and saw a tiny sunflower in a crack across the road next to the median. He stopped at the next coffee shop and wrote Sammy Sunflower. 
&quot;Sammy Sunflower&quot; is a simple, happy fictional tale of how sunflowers got their name. The story also teaches youngsters how the sun rises in the East and sets in the West. 
It is beautifully illustrated and recommended for children ages 2  6.
Thank you and enjoy!
- Darrell Monroe&quot;" />
