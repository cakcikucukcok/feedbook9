  <title>LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA CRUZ VERDE - A legend of Mexico City - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 394&lt;br /&gt;
In this 394nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Mexican legend, &amp;quot;LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA CRUZ VERDE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago in the ancient land of Anahuac, in the great city founded by Tenochtitlan over seven centuries ago, is a small street now called Calle de la Cruz Verde, or the Green Cross Street.&lt;br /&gt;
The house with the green cross on it stands at the corner of the Calle de la Cruz Verdeand the Calle de Migueles. It was a fine house in the days after Do&amp;ntilde;a Mar&amp;iacute;a&amp;#39;s father built it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is told that a gentleman, Don Alvaro de Villadiego y Manrique, came to Mexico in the train of the Viceroy Don Gast&amp;oacute;n de Peralta, who arrived in Mexico City in September 1566. It happened that one day he was out riding his Arabian and came prancing down the Calle de Migueles. In the balcony of a corner house he saw a very beautiful young lady, who was most genteel in her appearance and as white as snow. He instantly fell in love with her and she with him, although she was too well mannered to show it. At that moment, he resolved to marry her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But young love does not always run easy and true especially when there are cultural differences.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to Don Alvaro and Do&amp;ntilde;a Mar&amp;iacute;a? Was their love for one another fulfilled or did events conspire to keep them apart? Also, what is the background to the creation of the Green Cross? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
