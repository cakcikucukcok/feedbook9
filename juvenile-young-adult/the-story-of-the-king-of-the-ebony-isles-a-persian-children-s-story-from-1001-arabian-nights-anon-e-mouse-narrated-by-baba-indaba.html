A young prince succeeds the throne of his country upon his father&amp;rsquo;s death. He takes to himself a wife, his cousin and thinks himself happily married. One day whilst dozing in his chambers, his maid servants, thinking him asleep, begin speaking amongst themselves and what the young kings hears did not please him at all.&lt;br /&gt;

What did the young king overhear and what action did it lead him to take. Did it lead to action and adventure across the seas? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this story to find out where the young king eventually ended up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
