  <title>LEGENDS FROM RIVER AND MOUNTAIN - 19 Illustrated Children&#39;s Stories from Sinaia - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Retold by Carmen Sylva and Alma Strettell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this volume is to furnish our younger readers of the present generation with a fresh supply of stories&amp;mdash;half legend, half fairy-tale&amp;mdash;of a kind with which the children of an earlier time were more familiar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 19 illustrated stories from the Rhineland and old Roumania. Stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
The Jipi&lt;br /&gt;
The Serpent-Isle&lt;br /&gt;
V&amp;icirc;rful Cu Dor&lt;br /&gt;
Furnica&lt;br /&gt;
The Caraiman&lt;br /&gt;
The Stags&amp;rsquo; Valley&lt;br /&gt;
The Witch&amp;rsquo;s Stronghold&lt;br /&gt;
Piatra Arsa (&amp;ldquo;The Burnt Rock&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br /&gt;
R&amp;icirc;ul Doamnei (&amp;ldquo;The River Of The Princess&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br /&gt;
The Cave Of Jalomitza&lt;br /&gt;
The Nixies&amp;rsquo; Cleft&lt;br /&gt;
The Flying Castle&lt;br /&gt;
The Silver Nail&lt;br /&gt;
A Doubting Lover&lt;br /&gt;
A Legend&amp;nbsp; Of Walpurgis-Night&lt;br /&gt;
Seekers After Gold&lt;br /&gt;
The Maiden&amp;rsquo;s Rock&lt;br /&gt;
The Water-Snake (Parts I And II)&lt;br /&gt;
The Little Glass-Man&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first ten of these stories are taken from the German of Carmen Sylva, who has kindly given the translator her special permission to add them to the following collection of legends.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of them are associated with the mountains which surround her home among the pine-woods of Sinaia (Prahova County, Romania); others belong to the districts traversed by the Pelesch (Pele?) river (a tributary of the Prahova River), the merry stream that dashes through the ravine at the foot of her garden, &amp;ldquo;whispering all sorts of wonders and secrets to those who have ears to hear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The remaining tales in the volume are collected from different parts of Germany. &amp;ldquo;The Little Glass-man,&amp;rdquo; is a legend of the Black Forest, the other stories are all compiled from, or founded upon, legends to be met with in various German collections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to download and read these weird tales from Central and Eastern Europe. Tales which will entertain you for hours.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net income from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
