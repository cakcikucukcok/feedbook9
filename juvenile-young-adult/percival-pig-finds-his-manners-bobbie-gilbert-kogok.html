  <title>Percival Pig Finds His Manners - Bobbie Gilbert Kogok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poor Percival is having a terrible day. After Farmer Fred tosses him a red apple, Percival gobbles it down without a grunt of gratitude. There is no question that Percival has lost his manners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a now very grumpy Percival climbs out of the mud hole and begins searching for his manners, he knows he must find them quickly or his mother will not allow him to attend Timothy Turtles birthday party that afternoon. After Percival checks under the slop bucket, in the trough, and under a stone without any luck, friendly farm animals help with his search. Now only time will tell if Percival and his friends will be able to find his missing manners before Timothy Turtles party begins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful and colorful picture book, a grumpy but lovable pig who misplaces his manners learns about the importance of respect and kindness for others with assistance from his beloved barnyard buddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us, child or not, can relate to Percivals grumpy morning attitude and learn with him that we have within ourselves the power to change those negative feelings and behaviors.&lt;br&gt;
