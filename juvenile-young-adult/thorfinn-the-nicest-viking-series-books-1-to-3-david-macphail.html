  <title>Thorfinn the Nicest Viking series Books 1 to 3 - David MacPhail</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an ebook omnibus of books 1, 2 and 3 in the funny Thorfinn the Nicest Viking series. Prepare yourself for the wrath of the Norsemen! That is, if you don&#39;t mind and it&#39;s not too inconvenient… Thorfinn the Nicest Viking is a funny, illustrated, action-packed new series for young readers who love Horrid Henry and Diary of a Wimpy Kid, set in a world where manners mean nothing and politeness is pointless! In the first book, Thorfinn and the Awful Invasion, Thorfinn&#39;s dad, the rough tough village chief, decides it&#39;s time for Thorfinn to earn his gruesome Viking name. Stuck on a longboat with a ragtag bunch of adventurers who&#39;d like to throw him overboard, how will the nicest Viking cope with a dangerous voyage to Scotland? Book 2 sees Thorfinn and the Vikings heading to the annual Gruesome Games on a Scottish island. It falls to Thorfinn to save their village, but in a competition where belching, axe-throwing, pie-clobbering and goat-throwing are great point scorers, what help will a terribly nice Viking with a talent for baking be? In book 3, on a raiding voyage to Scotland, Thorfinn is kidnapped by Ranald MacRanald, chieftain of the Clan MacRanald. Little does Ranald he know that his methods of &#39;torture&#39; (making the Nicest Viking sew with the women and clean the castle from top to bottom) are actually Thorfinn&#39;s idea of a brilliant Scottish holiday! Will Chief Harald the Skull-Splitter come to his son&#39;s &#39;rescue&#39; before Thorfinn drives the Rotten Scots crazy with politeness?" />
