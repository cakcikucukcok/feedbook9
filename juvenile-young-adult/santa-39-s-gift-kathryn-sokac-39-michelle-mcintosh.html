  <title>Santa&#39;s Gift - Kathryn Sokac&#39;, Michelle McIntosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Santas Gift was inspired by the sculpture known to almost everyone as The Kneeling Santa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins the week before the winter holiday, and Santa has gone to bed early. Just as he begins to doze off, an angel appears to him. The angel proceeds to tell Santa of a very special child that is about to be born and asks him to look for the star that shines as brightly as the love in a childs eyes on the evening of his yearly ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the angel leaves as suddenly as she appeared, Santa gets an idea for the perfect gift for this special child and goes to his workshop to make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story continues on and follows Santa as he explains his visit from the angel and the night of his yearly journey to find the special child, which brings the sculpture of The Kneeling Santa full circle and changes the name of the winter holiday forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santas Gift is a story that relates the message, It isnt what you give someone or what the cost; the best gift is the gift of love and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
