  <title>Adventures of Ariston the Boy Mage - David Scott Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What mage?&quot; Aheam immediately questioned.&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;Me, what do you want with me?&quot; Ariston whimpered.&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;I have questions!&quot; the red dragon Zaira replied.&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;After we discuss the terms with the Earl, and while Aheam looks for the scepter, you may talk to Ariston in my presence!&quot; Tibalt firmly insisted. Tibalt had heard of the red dragons&#39; deep hatred for mages and he had grown fond of Ariston.&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;Ariston&#39;s a mage?&quot; Aheam stated in shock. Ariston had slain a dragon and had performed admirably as a squire for Tibalt, it was turning Aheam&#39;s idea of mages upside down. He actually liked Ariston.&lt;/p&gt;
Having lost his parents at a very young age and having his elder sister ripped away from him by the sinister Dark Mages might make anyone lose hope. But the twelve-year-old Ariston isn&#39;t just anyone. Sure living day to day isn&#39;t easy, but he and his two best friends, Elina and Faustus, make do. Their courage, perseverance, and loyalty inspire new friendships-honorable men including the Great Knight of Adar and the mage Pilan the All Powerful. Perhaps it is possible to rescue Ariston&#39;s sister from the clutches of the Dark Mages. After all great friendships lead to great deeds!" />
