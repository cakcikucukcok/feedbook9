Before he can regain the safety of the schoolyard, he is stopped by a policeman who informs&amp;nbsp;Joshua his mum is in hospital, having had an accident.&amp;nbsp;Being very concerned about his mum, he&amp;nbsp;is about to leave with the policeman. Instantly his soul buddy,Tav is between him and the policeman, shielding him - visible only to Joshua.&amp;nbsp;Tav makes him aware this is not normal behaviour for a policeman; reminding him of the school rules about not leaving the school grounds without his parent; urging him to run to the safety of the schoolyard; asking him to note&amp;nbsp;what the policeman was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua gets a very big fright and runs to his teacher who alerts the School Principal.&amp;nbsp; Checking with the Police Department confirms that his mum has not had an accident.
