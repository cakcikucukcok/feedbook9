  <title>Buddy Goes Beachside - Angel Kitts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Buddy the Maltese pup has no idea what adventures await him when his family- Lydia, Celeste, Angel, and Tim-take him on a drive from the mountains of Tennessee to their vacation destination: Destin, Florida. The fun starts even before they get to the beautiful Gulf Coast city by the sea. On the way, Buddy stops at a drive thru for the first time-and he likes it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddy and his family cant believe what they see! It looks like the city is floating, and people seem to be having a great time boating. As they cross the bridge, they see a pretty light house and a water slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Buddy arrives at the Beachside Inn he sees lots of other dogs. He even makes a friend! The people are walking to the beach with their surfboards and beach balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddys family goes out for a day of adventure. Buddy is truly happy when they return to the Inn and take him for a walk in the moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night, Buddy is in for an even greater thrill when bright fireworks burst in the sky to celebrate the Fourth of July.&lt;/p&gt;" />
