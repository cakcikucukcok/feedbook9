  <title>THE LEAF FAIRIES and other Children&#39;s Fairy Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 235&lt;br /&gt;
In this 235th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of The Leaf Fairies who live in a forest full of beautiful trees and flowers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away in a wood, the Leaf Fairies were busy making their leaves. They made them of every shape and size, for each fairy had her own idea of what looked prettiest. Some made them long and narrow, like tall and graceful ladies; some made them round and dumpy, like fat little men; some made them heart-shaped, and some cut up the edges till they were all dainty points and curves. Some placed them sitting down on the branches, while others set them on slender stalks. There was no set rule for anything. Each fairy followed her own pretty fancy.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Shall we never have time to play?&amp;quot; asked the leaves anxiously.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; said the fairies. &amp;quot;When the family is fed each day you may dance with the winds and play hide-and-seek with the sunbeams, and when the autumn is here and all your work is done, we ourselves will take you for a pleasure trip.&amp;quot; And so they did. But where did they go? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, read all about Little Violet and the story of The Violet and the Maple Tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
