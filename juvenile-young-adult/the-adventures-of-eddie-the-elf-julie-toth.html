  <title>The Adventures of Eddie the Elf - Julie Toth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The publishing company has asked me why I wanted to write this book. It is really quite simple.
One, I love little children! I love to watch them absorb new lessons and then think about them and apply them as they grow.
Secondly, I absolutely love Christmas! I love what it stands for and all the happiness it generates.
Theres an old saying that goes Life has a way of getting in the way. That is so true. I have wanted to write this book since I was about twenty. I am now sixty-six! First, you go to work, then you get married, and then children come along. Of course, we had our share of furry and feathered children. At last count, I have had sixteen dogs, three cats, and eight birds. Oh, yes, and then there was Wiggles, our rabbit. Did I mention that I also have two sons and two beautiful granddaughters? They are all of the human variety of course.
But Eddie was always in the back of my mind. Its strange that he would usually pop up in the summer of all times! I think it was because we used to have a big garden and Mother Nature was always good to us. We would give our neighbors some of our bounty of tomatoes, peppers, and garlic. That, in a way, was like Christmas because it was like giving them presents. Instead of Eddie, we were the elves for Mother Nature, and she was Santa.
There are so many marvelous things in the world, Christmas being one of my favorites. I hope that, when you read my book, you will learn a lot more about where the elves and Santa live. It really is a beautifully happy and busy place. Happy reading and imagining!" />
