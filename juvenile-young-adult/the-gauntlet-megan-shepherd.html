But Armstrong is no paradise; ruled by a power-hungry sheriff,&amp;#160; it&amp;#8217;s a violent world where the teens are enslaved and put to work in mines.

But it isn&amp;#8217;t just a deranged sheriff she has to overcome: the other intelligent species&amp;#8212;the Axion, Kindred, Gatherers, and Mosca&amp;#8212;all have their own reasons to stop her. Not knowing who to trust, Cora must rely on her own instincts to win the competition, which could change the world&amp;#8212;though it might destroy her in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
