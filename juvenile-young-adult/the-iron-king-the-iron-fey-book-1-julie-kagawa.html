  <title>The Iron King (The Iron Fey, Book 1) - Julie Kagawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;The Iron King&lt;/em&gt; is a must read!’&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; New York Times &lt;/em&gt; bestselling author, Gena Showalter&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Meghan Chase has a secret destiny – one she could never have imagined… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something has always felt slightly off in Meghan&#39;s life, ever since her father disappeared before her eyes when she was six. She has never quite fit in at school… or at home. When a dark stranger begins watching her from afar, and her prankster best friend becomes strangely protective of her, Meghan senses that everything she&#39;s known is about to change. But she could never have guessed the truth – that she is the daughter of a mythical faery king and is a pawn in a deadly war.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Meghan will learn just how far she&#39;ll go to save someone she cares about, to stop a mysterious evil no faery creature dare face… and to find love with a young prince who might rather see her dead than let her touch his icy heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt; Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Iron King&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘God, I pretty much devoured this book.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘This book was outstanding… I was totally enthralled.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I never wanted to leave the beautiful world Julie Kagawa painted.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘The Iron King is a breath of fresh air after a string of mediocre novels.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
