  <title>The Collector - Victoria Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Witty, and so intriguing. I started reading and didn&#39;t want to stop. Victoria Scott is a fabulous new voice in YA.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; --C.C. Hunter, author of the New York Times bestselling series SHADOW FALLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante  Walker is flippin&#39; awesome, and he knows it. His good looks, killer  charm, and stellar confidence has made him one of Hell&#39;s best -- a soul  collector. His job is simple, weed through humanity and label those  round rears with a big red good or bad stamp. Old Saint Nick gets the  good guys, and he gets the fun ones. Bag-and-tag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sealing  souls is nothing personal. Dante&#39;s an equal opportunity collector and  doesn&#39;t want it any other way. But he&#39;ll have to adjust, because Boss  Man has given him a new assignment: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collect Charlie Cooper&#39;s soul within 10 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante  doesn&#39;t know why Boss Man wants Charlie, nor does he care. This  assignment means only one thing to him, and that&#39;s a permanent ticket  out of Hell. But after Dante meets the quirky, Nerd Alert chick he&#39;s  come to collect--he realizes this assignment will test his abilities as a  collector, and uncover emotions long ago buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dante Walker series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 The Collector&lt;br&gt;Book #2 The Liberator&lt;br&gt;Book #3 The Warrior&lt;/p&gt;" />
