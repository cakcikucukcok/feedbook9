  <title>Treasure Island (Wisehouse Classics Edition - With Original Illustrations by Louis Rhead) - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;TREASURE ISLAND&lt;/em&gt; is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of &quot;buccaneers and buried gold&quot;. It was originally serialized in the children&#39;s magazine Young Folks between 1881 through 1882 under the title Treasure Island, or the mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym &quot;Captain George North&quot;. It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell &amp; Co.&lt;br/&gt; Treasure Island is traditionally considered a coming-of-age story, and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is also noted as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality-as seen in Long John Silver-unusual for children&#39;s literature. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an &quot;X&quot;, schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders." />
