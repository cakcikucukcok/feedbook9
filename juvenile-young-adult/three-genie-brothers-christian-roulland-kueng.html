  <title>Three Genie Brothers - Christian Roulland Kueng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;JD, Morgan, and Blake are ten-year-old junior genie triplets. Theyve spent all their lives inside an amethyst bottle with their mother and father, Aristede and Cassidy. They become suddenly interested in the outside world when they view a young girl through the window of their genie bottle; they soon learn her name is Brianna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brianna has come to visit her grandparents, the owners of the genie jar. She feels drawn to the beautiful bottle, and when she pops the cork, she becomes the master of the genies inside. The triplets are mischievous, though, and they plan to trick Brianna into using all her wishes right away. Their mischief goes too far when Brianna finds herself trapped inside their bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys are happy to introduce her to the world of the jinn. They show her genie mail, flying camel races, and even a game called JinJi. On the boys eleventh birthday, they receive a mysterious pentagonal box. Opening the strange gift is a riddle, but it seems the box could have the power to send Brianna home; if not, she could be stuck in the bottle forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
