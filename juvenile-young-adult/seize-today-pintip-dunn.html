      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RITA(R) award winner for Best Young Adult Romance 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The third book in the &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling series is a thrilling conclusion to an epic trilogy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Olivia Dresden is a precognitive. Since different versions of people&#39;s futures flicker before her eyes, she doesn&#39;t have to believe in human decency. She can see the way for everyone to be their best self-if only they would make the right decisions. No one is more conflicted than her mother, and Olivia can only watch as Chairwoman Dresden chooses the dark, destructive course every time. Yet Olivia remains fiercely loyal to the woman her mother could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the chairwoman captures Ryder Russell, the striking and strong-willed boy from the rebel Underground, Olivia sees a vision of her own imminent death...at Ryder&#39;s hand. Despite her bleak fate, she rescues Ryder and flees with him, drawing her mother&#39;s fury and sparking a romance as doomed as Olivia herself. As the full extent of Chairwoman Dresden&#39;s gruesome plan is revealed, Olivia must find the courage to live in the present-and stop her mother before she destroys the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forget Tomorrow series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Before Tomorrow (Prequel)&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Forget Tomorrow&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Remember Yesterday&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Seize Today&lt;/p&gt;" />
