  <title>Poppy - Avi, Brian Floca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boston Globe-Horn Book&lt;/em&gt; Award Winner * ALA Notable Book * ALA &lt;em&gt;Booklist &lt;/em&gt;Editors&amp;#8217; Choice * &lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; Best Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;This exciting story is richly visual. The underlying messages, to challenge unjust authority and to rely on logic and belief in oneself, are palatably blended with action and suspense.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second book in the beloved Poppy series by Newbery Medal&amp;#8211;winning author Avi, with inviting illustrations from Caldecott Medal&amp;#8211;winning artist Brian Floca, is now available as an ebook for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy knew she was taking a risk following her beloved Ragweed to Bannock Hill, but a night of dancing with the handsome golden mouse was just too tempting. So when Ragweed is scooped up by the sinister owl, Mr. Ocax, who rules over Dimwood forest, she&amp;#8217;s devastated. Her whole life she was warned of Mr. Ocax&amp;#8217;s evil ways&amp;#8230;how could she have been so foolish to put herself &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Ragweed at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, when Poppy attempts to move with her family to a different part of the woods where the food supply is richer, Mr. Ocax refuses to let them go. Despite what she&amp;#8217;s been led to believe for years, Mr. Ocax is not as strong as he wants the mice to think he is. Armed with the bravery, gumption, and wit of a hero, Poppy embarks on a dangerous quest&amp;#8212;joined by the irascible but lovable porcupine, Ereth&amp;#8212;to defeat Mr. Ocax and lead her family to a better home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perennially popular story of courage and determination, Poppy is a fixture on state award lists and in classrooms across the country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
