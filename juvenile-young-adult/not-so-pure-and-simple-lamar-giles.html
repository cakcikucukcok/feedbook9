  <title>Not So Pure and Simple - Lamar Giles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Indie Next List Pick!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his first contemporary teen novel, critically acclaimed author and two-time Edgar Award finalist Lamar Giles spotlights the consequences of societal pressure, confronts toxic masculinity, and explores the complexity of what it means to be a &amp;#8220;real man.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Del has had a crush on Kiera Westing since kindergarten. And now, during their junior year, she&amp;#8217;s finally available. So when Kiera volunteers for an opportunity at their church, Del&amp;#8217;s right behind her. Though he quickly realizes he&amp;#8217;s inadvertently signed up for a Purity Pledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His dad thinks his wires are crossed, and his best friend, Qwan, doesn&amp;#8217;t believe any girl is worth the long game. But Del&amp;#8217;s not about to lose his dream girl, and that&amp;#8217;s where fellow pledger Jameer comes in. He can put in the good word. In exchange, Del just has to get answers to the Pledgers&amp;#8217; questions&amp;#8230;about sex ed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With other boys circling Kiera like sharks, Del needs to make his move fast. But as he plots and plans, he neglects to ask the most important question: What does Kiera want? He can&amp;#8217;t think about that too much, though, because once he gets the girl, it&amp;#8217;ll all sort itself out. Right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
