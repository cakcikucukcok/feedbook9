  <title>Trip #1 - Jid the Kid, Lukas, S.K.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BOOK(S) BY LUKAS/S K/JID THE KID
Consider a series dealing with a boy and girl living through some of Americas special time periods.  As the series progresses, they will have offspring who will continue to live through significant time periods, etc.
We will begin the series during the slave period in America (1840s and through the 1860s).  The significant periods will be as follows:
1.	Civil War and just after	(1845-1866)
2.	Post-Civil War and Reconstruction and Industrial Revolution	(1866-1915)
3.	World War I to the Great Depression		(1915-1928)
4.	Great Depression through World War II	(1929-1945)
5.	Post-World War II through the 1950s	(1945-1960)
6.	The 1960s
7.	The 1970s and 1980s
8.	The 1990and the 21st Century
This series will aim at young people so as to educate them about Americas progression through the past 150+ years.  The goal is to allow them to better understand what has happened in our history to make us who we are.  The learning experiences that will occur, hopefully, will happen before they are asked to learn about the past in school.  We will look at these periods through the eyes of the original pair of young people and continue with the generations they father and mother.  Hopefully, the younger generations will better understand who and what America is and was.  This should enable them to do better in Social Studies and related classes they will have to take in school.  Understanding the past will allow for a better understanding of what we might expect in the future.  It should also give those who read these stories a greater desire to want to know more about the past.
Many of the stories told are through the eyes of the three authorsa 13-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl, and their grandfather (slightly older than they are).  Relating events that took place during each generation, through their eyes, can put life into those events.  Including additional circumstances that happened can also add significant fun facts that the reader should find interesting and curious.  We want history to come to life for each young person who reads this series.
