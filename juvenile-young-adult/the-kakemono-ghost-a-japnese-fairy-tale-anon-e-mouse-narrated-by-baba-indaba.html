  <title>The KAKEMONO GHOST - A Japnese Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 418&lt;br /&gt;
In this 3xxth issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Japanese Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE KAKEMONO GHOST&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DOWN the Inland Sea between Umedaichi and Kure (now a great naval port) and in the province of Aki, there is a small village called Yaiyama, in which lived a painter of some note whose name was Abe Tenko.&lt;br /&gt;
Tenko had had a sister who went into the service of the Lord of Aki, by whom she had a daughter, whose name was Kimi. Had the child been a son, it would have been adopted into the Aki family; but, being a daughter, it was, according to Japanese custom, sent back to its mother&amp;#39;s family, with the result that Tenko took charge of the child. The mother being dead, the child had lived with him for sixteen years.&lt;br /&gt;
Our story opens with O Kimi grown into a pretty girl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To supplement his meagre income he taught aspiring artists who took daily lessons from him. One of his most promising pupils was Sawara Kameju.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the arrival of the young student O Kimi&amp;#39;s heart gave her much trouble. She fell in love with him Sawara.He admired O Kimi greatly; but of love he never said a word, being too much absorbed in his study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many mostly serious things happened, as matters of the heart can only be serious in nature. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out exactly what happened to Tenko, Sawara and Kimi!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
