&lt;br /&gt;
Here the story of how Arthur became King is told&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
While at a tourney on Christmas day, Arthur&amp;rsquo;s brother forgot his sword at home. As Arthur was too young to compete, his brother asked him to ride home and collect it for him. This he did but could not gain entry to the house.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the way he had seen a sword in a stone so, without any other options, rode to that and tried drawing the sword, which came out very easily. He rode back to the tourney and presented the sword. When his father saw the sword all pandemonium broke loose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What had Arthur done? Was he in trouble? What did the drawing of the sword mean? Well, what happened next you ask and just how did everything turn out in the end? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
