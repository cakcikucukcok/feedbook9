  <title>Touching Fate - Brenda Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Touching Fate&lt;/i&gt; swept me away in a world of magic, adventure, and sexy romance, where not everything is as it seems, and fate, while written in the stars, isn&#39;t always fixed. A spellbinding tale of love and choices...and did I mention the hot European accents??&quot;&lt;i&gt; - &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rachel Harris, NYT bestselling author of The Fine Art of Pretending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aster Layne believes in physics, not psychics. A tarot card reading on the Ocean City Boardwalk should have been a ridiculous, just-for-fun thing. It wasn&#39;t. Aster discovers she has a very &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;scientific gift-with a simple touch of the cards, she can change a person&#39;s fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reese Van Buren is cursed. Like the kind of old-school, centuries-old curse that runs in royal families. Every firstborn son is doomed to die on his eighteenth birthday-and Reese&#39;s is coming up fast. Bummer. He tries to distract himself from his inevitable death...only to find the one person who can save him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aster doesn&#39;t know that the hot Dutch guy she&#39;s just met needs her help-or that he&#39;s about to die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But worst of all...she doesn&#39;t know that her new gift comes with dark, dark consequences that can harm everyone she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fated series is best enjoyed in order. &lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Touching Fate&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Cursing Fate&lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Seeking Fate&lt;/p&gt;" />
