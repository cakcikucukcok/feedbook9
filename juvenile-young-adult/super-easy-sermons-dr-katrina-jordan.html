  <title>Super Easy Sermons - Dr. Katrina Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thank you for your purchase of this book, which is the fulfilment of a dream I have had for many years. More importantly, thank you for your interest in sharing the Word with little ones. Not everyone can minister to children; it is a calling and is not for the faint of heart. As an educator and a person who has ministered to the youngest of us for many years, I can tell you that there is also no age group that will give you more joy or more fulfilment. Mark 10:15 tells us, Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it (NIV). There is a reason for that: no one believes to the extent that a child does. They have not been jaded by life, and they dont know that all is not right with the world. It is this faith and belief that makes working with them so meaningful. Remember, they might not remember what you say, but they will always remember how you made them feel. Make them feel the love of God." />
