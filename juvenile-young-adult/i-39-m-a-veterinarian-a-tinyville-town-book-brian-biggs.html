  <title>I&amp;#39;m a Veterinarian (A Tinyville Town Book) - Brian Biggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Tinyville Town series, new from &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author and illustrator Brian Biggs, launches with three books: &lt;I&gt;Tinyville Town Gets to Work!&lt;/I&gt;, a world-establishing picture book that introduces the town and its many residents, and two board books, &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Veterinarian&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Firefighter&lt;/I&gt;. The series is set in a cozy community where the people are kind, everyone says hello when they&amp;rsquo;re walking down the street, the bus is always on time, and all the townsfolk do their part to keep things running smoothly. Everyone has a job to do in Tinyville Town. With a nod to the busy world of Richard Scarry and the neighborhood feel of &lt;I&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/I&gt;, this new series will become a favorite read for preschoolers and is ideal for story time and class discussions about occupations and community helpers. Tinyville Town is a growing, thriving city full of interesting people. They can&amp;rsquo;t wait to show readers around!&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; In &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Veterinarian&lt;/I&gt;, we see what it&amp;rsquo;s like in a day in the life of a town animal doctor. Tinyville Town&amp;rsquo;s veterinarian begins her day at home with her two cats, two dogs, and one fish. Once at work, she examines a firefighter&amp;rsquo;s dalmatian, who is not feeling well at all. Follow along as the vet runs tests and makes a surprising discovery! This book will comfort a child bringing a beloved pet to the vet for the first time, and satisfy an inquisitive child&amp;rsquo;s curiosity about what an animal doctor does, how they are able to diagnose so many different kinds of pets, and how their office is different from their own doctors.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Every town has at least one vet office, and Tinyville&amp;rsquo;s is the one kids will want to visit again and again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
