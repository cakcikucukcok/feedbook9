  <title>THE HAUNTED SHIP - A Greek Children’s Story of the Sea - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 282&lt;br /&gt;
In this 282nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Greek fairy tale of &amp;ldquo;THE HAUNTED SHIP&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One night Nassos, Captain and owner of a Greek karave (similar in structure to a dromon.) On one trip they were sailing to Sicily from Greece and once the sun had set the breeze dropped and there was not much for the crew to do except wait for the breeze to return.&lt;br /&gt;
Bored, Nassos fetched his old fiddle and began to play. All too soon he saw a beautiful maiden with long blonde hair drifting alongside the ship. He carried on playing and more appeared, some coming onboard to listen. They were amazing creatures, half human, half fish. The like he had never seen before in all his years of sailing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All too quickly his men captured one maiden and began drawing lots for her. Begging them to let her go, but the men refused and bound her. Nassos stopped playing to tell the men to set her free. But the other maidens fled his ship diving beneath the waves, emitting soul-piercing screams before they disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
Then it happened&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened you ask? Well, mermaids are really nothing like Disney&amp;rsquo;s Little Mermaid. Despite their beauty and kindness, they also have a dark and malevolent aspect to their nature as well. You&amp;rsquo;re invited to download and read this story to find out what happened to Nassos and his crew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
