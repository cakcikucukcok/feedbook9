      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Grow with the spirited, sometimes awkward, but always charming&amp;nbsp;Lily as she learns what real beauty is&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In this fun, entertaining story, readers meet awkward sixth grader Lily Robbins who, after receiving a compliment about her looks from a woman in the modeling business, becomes obsessed with her appearance and with becoming a model. As she sets her sights on winning the model search fashion show, she exchanges her rock and feather collection for lip gloss, fashion magazines, and a private “club” with her closest friends. But when the unthinkable happens the night before the fashion show, Lily learns a valuable lesson about real beauty.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;This best-selling, biblically based fiction series for girls—with a fresh new look and updated content—addresses social issues and coming-of-age topics, all with the spunk and humor of Lily Robbins as she fumbles her way through unfamiliar territory.
