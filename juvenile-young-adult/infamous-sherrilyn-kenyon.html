  <title>Infamous - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world has fallen in love with Nick Gautier and the Dark-Hunters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Nick&#39;s saga continues in the next eagerly anticipated volume...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to school. Get good grades. Stay out of trouble. That&#39;s the mandate for most kids. But Nick Gautier isn&#39;t the average teenager. He&#39;s a boy with a destiny not even he fully understands. And his first mandate is to stay alive while everyone, even his own father, tries to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s learned to annihilate zombies and raise the dead, divination and clairvoyance, so why is learning to drive and keep a girlfriend so dang hard? But that isn&#39;t the primary skill he has to master. Survival is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in order to survive, his next lesson makes all the others pale in comparison. He is on the brink of becoming either the greatest hero mankind has ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or he&#39;ll be the one who ends the world. With enemies new and old gathering forces, he will have to call on every part of himself to fight or he&#39;ll lose everyone he cares about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
