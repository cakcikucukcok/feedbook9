  <title>THE SAGA OF GUNNLAUG THE WORM-TONGUE AND RAVEN THE SKALD - A Norse/Viking Saga - Anon E. Mouse, Translated by Eirikr Magnusson &amp; William Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The saga of &lt;i&gt;Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and Raven the Skald,&lt;/i&gt; composed in the 13th century, relates the story of two Icelandic poets Gunnlaugr Ormstunga and Hrafn &amp;Ouml;nundarson, and their competition for the love of Helga the Fair, daughter of &amp;THORN;orsteinn Egilsson and granddaughter of Egill Skallagr&amp;iacute;msson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story opens with a prophetic dream of two eagles fighting over a swan, prefiguring the love triangle in the story. The rivalry is initially fought using verse, but later with weapons, when Gunnlaug challenges Hrafn to a holmgang -- a duel, the recognised Norse way of settling disputes. The narrative follows Gunnlaugr and is sympathetic towards him as it describes his ambitious career as a court poet across Scandinavia and the British Isles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The saga has similarities to earlier sagas of poets, such as Korm&amp;aacute;ks saga and Bjarnar saga, but it is more refined and elegant with strong characterization and emotional impact. Long considered a masterpiece, the saga is often read by new students of Old Norse literature.&lt;br /&gt;
William Morris is normally thought of as a fantasy precursor of Tolkien, having written &lt;i&gt;The Wood Beyond the World&lt;/i&gt; among other works. But he was also a translator, along with Eir&amp;iacute;kr Magn&amp;uacute;sson, of more than just a few Norse Sagas. Originally written in the old Icelandic language, considered to be the closest tongue to that spoken by the Vikings, &lt;i&gt;Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and Raven the Skald&lt;/i&gt; is but one of those efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
