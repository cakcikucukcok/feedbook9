  <title>Uncle Daddy - Ralph Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does Rivers have room in his life for two very different fathers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The truth is Uncle Daddy isn&#39;t either my father or my uncle. He&#39;s actually Mom&#39;s uncle. I was three years old when he came to live with us.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Rivers&#39;s real father left him and his mom six years ago, Uncle Daddy has been taking care of Rivers in all the ways a dad cares for a son -- even teaching him how to play baseball. Then his real father returns. Rivers is confused and angry. He had always thought that he&#39;d express his anger at his father by socking him in the stomach. Now, face to face with him, Rivers&#39; feelings are more complicated than he&#39;d imagined. Will the reappearance of his dad affect his relationship with Uncle Daddy? This heart-felt story, told from the point of view of a nine-and-a-half-year-old boy, is filled with insight and touches of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beneath the wild humor, there are surprisingly subtle messages about responsibility and courage.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;School Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
