  <title>Abe to the Rescue - Diana Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Charlie learns to swim, his father takes him to choose a new puppy as a reward. But to his Dads surprise Charlie chooses a small quiet puppy he calls Abe, because somehow he knows this is just the dog for him! 
Dad complains that Abe wont play or fetch and is afraid of everything  even dogs half his size  but Charlie understands what its like to be shy and tells Abe that they will try to be tough and brave together.
One night, Abe decides to put a cunning doggy plan into action when he overhears Charlie telling Dad that he is being bullied at school by a boy called Garth.
Not only does Abe teach Garth a (rather amusing) lesson he will never forget, but he also shows Dad and his classmates that bravery comes in all shapes and sizes and that lots of our problems can be solved if we just have a loyal friend." />
