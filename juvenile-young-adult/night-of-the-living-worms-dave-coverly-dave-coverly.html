  <title>Night of the Living Worms - Dave Coverly, Dave Coverly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s a bird to do when his sibling is a big-time celebrity? It&#39;s a question Speed Bump has to deal with every single morning, because his brother happens to be the one and only Early Bird. You know, THE Early Bird, who ALWAYS gets the worm! Unfortunately, Speed Bump is a sleepy little bird with a big head and tiny wings who&#39;s worried he&#39;ll never live up to his brother. But he has a great buddy, the ever-hungry Slingshot, who knows how to lift his spirits. Together, they end up on an adventure deep in the nighttime forest, where they&#39;re forced to confront something more terrifying--and slimier--than they&#39;ve ever imagined. It could all go horribly wrong . . . or it could just change Speed Bump&#39;s luck for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
