  <title>Beauty for Ashes - Kaye Kirkland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dante and Adonis are two black teens with bright futures who are trying to leave a gang. But when they are stopped by the Atlanta police one night, everything changes for both of them.   After Dante loses his best friend at the hands of a trigger-happy cop, he embarks on a desperate quest to defy the odds and break free from a dangerous world. While journeying down a perilous, seemingly predestined path, Dante is joined by four other teens: his girlfriend Jordyn, her former best friend Jasmine, and Richard and Rashida, two recent Atlanta transplants. As the group forms friendships in the most unlikely places, their beliefs about good and evil are turned upside down. While discovering who they can and cannot trust and unearthing unexpected dangers, will the group of friends somehow survive their risky plan of escaping the city to find a better life?   Beauty for Ashes is a raw story that reveals the struggles five diverse teenagers must face under a corrupt justice system while living in urban America." />
