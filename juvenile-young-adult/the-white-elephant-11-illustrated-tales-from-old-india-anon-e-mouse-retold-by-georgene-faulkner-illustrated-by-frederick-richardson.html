  <title>THE WHITE ELEPHANT - 11 illustrated tales from Old India - Anon E. Mouse, Retold by Georgene Faulkner, Illustrated by Frederick Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 11 illustrated children&amp;rsquo;s tales from Old India, all with lessons to equip children for life. In this volume you will find the stories of:&lt;br /&gt;
The White Elephant&lt;br /&gt;
The Grain of Corn&lt;br /&gt;
The Timid Little Rabbit&lt;br /&gt;
Singh Rajah and the Cunning Little Jackals&lt;br /&gt;
The Kingdom of Mouseland&lt;br /&gt;
The Alligator and the Jackal&lt;br /&gt;
The Bold Blackbird&lt;br /&gt;
The Kid and the Tiger&lt;br /&gt;
The Brahmin and the Tiger&lt;br /&gt;
The Bear&amp;rsquo;s Bad Bargain&lt;br /&gt;
The Man Who Rode a Tiger&lt;br /&gt;
These old, old tales from India have been favorites for many, many years; some have come down to us from the early days of Buddha and beyond. Some have been taken from a book, called the &amp;ldquo;Jataka Tales,&amp;rdquo; (also published by Abela Publishing) telling of the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s previous existences. Others have been translated from the Pali, or Magadhan, by Eugene Watson Burlinghame, and they have also been retold for us in attractive form by Ellen C. Babbitt.&lt;br /&gt;
These stories are somewhat similar to stories which we have all known in another form; for instance, our first story of &amp;ldquo;The White Elephant&amp;rdquo; is somewhat like the story of Androcles and the lion. While the story of &amp;ldquo;The Timid Little Rabbit&amp;rdquo; is like the old English tale of &amp;ldquo;Chicken Little.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Story of the Grain of Corn&amp;rdquo; (which is repeated from &amp;ldquo;Tales of the Punjab&amp;rdquo; by Flora Annie Steel) compares with our well-known version of &amp;ldquo;The Old Woman and the Pig.&amp;rdquo; In this same book, we find the story of &amp;ldquo;The Bear&amp;rsquo;s Bad Bargain,&amp;rdquo; and we learn how a stupid and clumsy bear is outwitted by a grasping old woman and her greedy husband. Even if they have the best of the bargain, our sympathies are all with the poor old bear.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The King of the Mice,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Bold Blackbird,&amp;rdquo; and&amp;ldquo;The Kid and the Tiger&amp;rdquo; (retold from &amp;ldquo;The Talking Thrush and Other Tales from India) are all stories of the triumph of the weak and cunning over the brutish and strong. &amp;ldquo;The Bold Blackbird&amp;rdquo; may remind you of the old French tale of&amp;ldquo;Drakesbill and His Friends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
So sit back with a steamy beverage and be prepared to be entertained for many-an-hour.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
