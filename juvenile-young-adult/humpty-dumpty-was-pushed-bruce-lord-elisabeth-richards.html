  <title>Humpty Dumpty Was Pushed - Bruce Lord, Elisabeth Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if you suspect your best friend, who happens to be a giant egg, was killed but everyone else thinks it was an accident? &lt;i&gt;Humpty Dumpty Was Pushed&lt;/i&gt;, a collection of twenty-two short fairy tale-like stories, tackles that question and many more. &lt;p&gt;
In this collection&#39;s title story, Chicken Little is certain his friend did not fall from the ledge, and he intends to prove there is a conspiracy. Will he discover the truth before it&#39;s too late? Filled with interesting and delightful characters, these short stories ask questions not raised before. Can a reverse vampire find true love? Can the World Nose Hair champion really make the world a better place? Is it ever wise to stick cheese noodles in your nose? Can one live their life squeezing other people&#39;s ears in peace? If a whale and a tiger had a fight who would win? &lt;P&gt;
Incorporating familiar characters in children&#39;s literature and folklore, &lt;i&gt;Humpty Dumpty Was Pushed&lt;/i&gt; tells a series of tales with surprises to keep you guessing. Each story asks a different question, and each story offers a different, strange answer." />
