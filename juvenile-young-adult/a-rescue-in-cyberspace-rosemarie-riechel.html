  <title>A Rescue in Cyberspace - Rosemarie Riechel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Molly and Erik are cousins who share a passion for creating computer programs with unexpected twists and turns. They live far away from each other, but modems and cyberspace keep them close. Erik often emails Molly, asking for help with his math homework. She obliges, as always, but then, one night, she surprises Erik by announcing that she is going on a trip, traveling as fast as email in cyberspace. Her cousin knows that Molly is working on a computer program that would enable cyberspace travel, but Erik does not believe she would succeed in making it work. However, doubt creeps into his mind as he considers the possibility that she might actually succeed. Erik drifts off to sleep thinking about his cousin Molly and her fascination with cyberspace travel. Awakened later in the night by a horrible crackling sound, Erik sees that his computer has turned an incredible electric blue. A red circle glows in the center of the screen, and behind it is Mollys face, mouthing, Erik! He leans forward and hears her faintly, telling him that she was pulled into her computer and is lost in cyberspace. Then her image fades. Believing that the red circle might get him to Molly Erik jabs it and begins his adventure in cyberspace, his quest to find Molly. Eriks fantastic and heroic journey leads him to strange places. He meets two creatures that fill him with the knowledge he needs to find his cousin. He then tumbles into another world that looks similar to Earth. Here he meets Mark, who, mysteriously, was expecting him. Mark reveals to Erik that his mission is greater than just finding Molly. Together they begin a quest to conquer the vile captives of Molly and the many children of Benelub, a place in cyberspace, and guide them back to the safety of their homes and parents. Erik listens carefully to Marks incredible story. He makes good use of the knowledge that was crammed into his brain to defeat evil. His slightly wavering bravery controls his movements. Tense with the significance of his quest, Erik takes the decisive action required of a conquering hero, with the same studied steps he takes when adding twists and turns to computer programs." />
