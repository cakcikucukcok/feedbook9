  <title>The Ghosts of Camals College - Ms Annette Siketa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Professor Lution, the Chancellor of the College of Customs and Myths and Legends, has a problem. Though there have been Darlings at Camals for generations, there is considerable opposition to the latest candidate, Grace. To compromise, the Professor conducts a suitability test - follow the clues to find a book. Being ignorant of these facts, Grace is thrust into the world of the supernatural. However, when the test is hijacked by the evil Viletrix and his hideous spectral army, Camals loses complete control. With the assistance of Wendy Wallace - who just &#39;happened&#39; to be there, Pan, Arjunar - a historical archer, Gwiffyn - a mysterious wise woman, and four extremely angry Incan ghosts, amongst many others, Grace wins the battle for Beatrigone, but it is not over yet.  Upon returning home, she must decide whether to attend Camals, or have all knowledge of Beatrigone and its strange and spooky inhabitants, wiped from her memory." />
