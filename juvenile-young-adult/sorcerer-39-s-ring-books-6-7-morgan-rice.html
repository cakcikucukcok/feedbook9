  <title>Sorcerer&#39;s Ring (Books 6-7) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;THE SORCERER&#39;S RING has all the ingredients for an instant success: plots, counterplots, mystery, valiant knights, and blossoming relationships replete with broken hearts, deception and betrayal. It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.&quot;--Books and Movie Reviews. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bundle includes books 6 and 7 in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling fantasy series THE SORCERER&#39;S RING (A CHARGE OF VALOR and A RITE OF SWORDS), a 17 book epic fantasy series with over 1,000 five star reviews. These two bestselling novels are both here in one convenient file.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A CHARGE OF VALOR (Book #6 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring), Thor continues on his quest, deeper into the Empire, to retrieve the stolen Destiny Sword and save the Ring. As he and his friends meet unexpected tragedy and lose a member of their close-knit group, Thor and his remaining friends become closer than they ever were, learning that they must face and overcome adversity together. Their journey takes them to new and exotic terrains, including the desolate Salt Fields, the Great Tunnel, and the Mountains of Fire, as they face a host of unexpected monsters at every turn.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A RITE OF SWORDS (Book #7 in the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring), Thor grapples with his legacy, battling to come to terms with who his father is, whether to reveal his secret, and what action he must take. Back home in the Ring, with Mycoples by his side and the Destiny Sword in hand, Thor is determined to wreak vengeance on Andronicus&#39; army and liberate his homeland-and to finally propose to Gwendolyn. But he comes to learn that there are forces even greater than he that might just stand in his way. In a final, shocking twist, Thor learns that while his powers are supreme, he also has a hidden weakness-one that may just bring his final downfall. Will Thor and the others liberate the Ring and defeat Andronicus? Will Gwendolyn become the queen they all need her to be? What will become of the Destiny Sword, of Erec, Kendrick, Reece and Godfrey? And what is the secret that Alistair is hiding?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, THE SORCERER&#39;S RING is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders." />
