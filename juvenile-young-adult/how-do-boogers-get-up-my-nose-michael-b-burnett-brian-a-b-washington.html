  <title>How Do Boogers Get up My Nose - Michael B. Burnett, Brian A.B. Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learning needs to be fun and enjoyable for every child. Having taught young children (K-2) for many years, I noticed that many of the nonfiction books I read to them were incomplete, which in many cases left them asking more why questions. I would do further research and explain to the students in words and thoughts they could understand. I found that this extra information makes them very happy and more excited regarding successful learning. Each book further explains to the young minds the rest of the story on topics that they had expressed interest in. My books all have the same format and goal. They are written for the child to have a question answered by asking other students, friends, and, finally, the adult who has the truth. The student, being satisfied with what they have learned, can discuss their findings with those they trust most. These short, easy- to-read stories are designed to have caregivers, parents, or grandparents take back the art of listening, discussing, and finally providing the child with much-needed affirmation to build their confidence, learning, and knowledge. These books have the ability to provide a positive learning experience in every childs life." />
