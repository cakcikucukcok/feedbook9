  <title>The Stolen One - Suzanne Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one wanted you. But I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kat&#39;s true identity is a secret, even from her. All she has ever known are Grace and Anna and their small village. Kat wants more&amp;#8212;more than hours spent embroidering finery for wealthy ladies and more than Christian, the gentle young farmer courting her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are wolves outside, Grace warns. Waiting, with their eyes glowing in the dark . . . and Grace has given Kat safety and a home when no one else would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a stranger appears in their cottage, bringing the mystery of Kat&#39;s birth with her. In one night, Kat&#39;s destiny finds her: She will leave. She will journey to London, and her skill with the needle will attract the notice of the magnificent Queen Elizabeth&amp;#8212;and of the wolves of the court. She will discover what Grace would never tell her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything will unravel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
