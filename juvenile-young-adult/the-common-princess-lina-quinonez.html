  <title>The Common Princess - Lina Quinonez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a small fishing village in a kingdom by the sea, a young girl named Marta has lost her parents and is now an orphan. A neighbor lady takes the child in, but instead of caring for her, the old lady puts her to work as a servant and feeds her only bread and water. And when the richest man in town comes looking for a servant girl, the old lady sells Marta to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta grows up as a servant and prisoner in the merchants house, unable to leave or find a better life for herself. Although she blossoms into a beautiful young lady, she is trapped in the life of a slave. One day, however, she encounters the kings son in the marketplace of the fishing village while she is carrying packages for the merchants chambermaid--and Marta and the prince fall instantly in love. But before they speak more than a few words, the chambermaid rushes Marta away. No one seems to be able to tell the prince how to locate the lovely lady he met in the marketplace. Can Marta ever escape her life and find her way to the prince and to happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this childrens story, a young orphan girl trapped in the difficult role of servant girl meets and falls in love with a prince, who must help her reach a better life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
