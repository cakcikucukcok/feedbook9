  <title>THE RAVEN OF THE GIRALDA - A Legend of Spain - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 429&lt;br /&gt;
In this 429th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Japanese Legend, &amp;quot;THE RAVEN OF THE GIRALDA&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago, a wise raven lived in the top of the Giralda, the Moorish bell tower of the cathedral in Seville, Spain. At night, he was often deep in talk with his special friend, the owl, who, when tired of roaming through the tops of the giant palm trees or of prowling into out-of-the-way nooks in the cathedral roof, liked to tell of his adventures. He often heard from the moonbeams, whose tales which, when repeated, made even the raven&amp;#39;s sober thoughts turn sprightly. What the raven liked best to hear was what the owl, or anyone else, could tell of the Giralda itself or of the mighty Cathedral below the tower.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now it happened that the wind, even more than the owl, was a friend of the raven. The wind had a tale to tell about his ancestor the Passarina and the monk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened you ask&amp;hellip;? As you would expect in these strange circumstances, many things could happen, and many did. To find the answers to these question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
