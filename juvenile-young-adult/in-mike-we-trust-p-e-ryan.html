He craved it.&lt;br /&gt;He could barely remember what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Garth&#39;s uncle comes to visit, he&#39;s like a breath of very needed fresh air. Mike is laid-back and relaxed&amp;#8212;and willing to accept Garth for who he is, without question.

He&#39;s forced to wonder: Is his uncle Mike really who he says he is, and can Garth trust him? More importantly, can Garth trust the person he&#39;s becoming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P. E. Ryan has crafted a clever and compelling novel that asks the question: How far will you go for your family, to find yourself?&lt;/p&gt;" />
