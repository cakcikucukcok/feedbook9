  <title>Shard - Andreas Zimmermann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the first day of summer vacation, Alex, Jared, and Madison find something more waiting for them at home than the normal freedom that comes with the end of school. Uncle Richard has come for a visit, bringing presents with him as always. This time, he gives the siblings their own miniature dragon figurines, each one a different color. But an even bigger surprise lies in store for them when, the next morning, Alex awakens to find that his green dragon has come alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children learn that the dragons are not simple statues as they had assumed, but are actually living, breathing dragons. And as the family settles into a new routine with three not-quite housebroken pets, Alex, Jared, and Madison learn that there is more to their story than they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an elder dragon from another realm appears and calls the young dragons back to his world, the siblings are accidentally pulled in too. They discover that the gateway of the magical realm and Earth has been magically sealed. To be sent home again requires the permission of the Dragon Council. But the journey is treacherous, and there are few who are happy with the childrens arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protected only by an elder and their own young dragon friends, the children must find a way to reach the council and convince its leaders to send them homepreferably alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
