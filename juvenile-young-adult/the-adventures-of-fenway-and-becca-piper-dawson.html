  <title>The Adventures of Fenway and Becca - Piper Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Best friends Fenway and Becca love life. The two energetic Chihuahuas were rescued from abuse and misery by a loving family, and they enjoy spending time with their owner, twelve-year-old Paige. But they also love something else: solving mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two exciting adventures, Fenway and Becca keep crime at bay in their small town. The two doggie detectives hunt for a mysterious flower snatcher in The Great Flower Caper. Fenway and Becca are determined to discover the truth, and on their daily walk, the duo picks up an interesting scent that may just lead them to the thief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fenway and Beccas Great Cabin Caper sees the pups go on vacation to the family cabin. Grandmas precious locket has disappeared, and Fenway and Becca set out to find it with the help of their new friend, Hoss, a yellow Labrador. But time is running out. The family is leaving soon, and they have yet to find the necklace!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a ride down mystery lane with these two adorable Chihuahuas and delve into fun and adventure!&lt;/p&gt;" />
