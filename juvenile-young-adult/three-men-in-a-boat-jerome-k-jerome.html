  <title>Three Men in a Boat - Jerome K. Jerome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) published in 1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a two-week boating holiday on the Thames from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back to Kingston. The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The three men are based on Jerome himself and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who would become a senior manager at Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom Jerome often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional but, &amp;ldquo;as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of inner consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element of the dog&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Following the overwhelming success of Three Men in a Boat, Jerome later published a sequel, about a cycling tour in Germany, titled Three Men on the Bummel (also known as Three Men on Wheels, 1900)." />
