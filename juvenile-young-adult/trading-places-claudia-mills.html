  <title>Trading Places - Claudia Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Todd and Amy Davidson may be twins, but they&#39;re complete opposites - Todd is organized and is the family &quot;engineer,&quot; while Amy is outgoing and has been dubbed the &quot;poet.&quot; So it would seem that for a fifth-grade economics project, Todd would come up with a master invention, and Amy would have a blast with her best friends as partners. To their surprise, Todd can&#39;t think of a single idea, and Amy gets stuck working with the class crybaby. Then Todd begins writing poetry . . . But this is nothing compared to the switch their parents have made. Their father has been unemployed for months and their mother has started to work at a crafts store. Now there&#39;s never enough food in the house, everybody is always on edge, and when Amy&#39;s friends come over after school, they find Mr. Davidson, uncombed and unshaven, in his ratty old bathrobe. Will life ever return to normal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With chapters that alternate between Todd&#39;s and Amy&#39;s points of view, this novel is a realistic and sometimes funny portrayal of a family adapting to changing roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trading Places&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
