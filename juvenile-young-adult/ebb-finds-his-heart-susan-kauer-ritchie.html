  <title>Ebbé Finds His Heart - Susan Kauer-Ritchie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ebb is a young troll who sets off on a journey to find his future. He first meets and rescues Freefall, a baby falcon that has fallen from his nest. Unwilling to leave little Falcon all alone, Ebb invites him to join on the journey. Next, they come upon Nibblets, a baby lemming who was separated from his family while running from danger. Nibblets tags along, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three friends grow to trust each other as their travel continues, and soon, they meet two dragonflies, Pinwheel and Hoverine. Lucky for Freefall, these winged characters teach him how to soar and even the fine art of loop-de-loops, dragonfly style! Their adventure takes a thrilling turn as Ebb and friends enter the mysterious, magical North Forest filled with faeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of us seekers like Ebb, the future is a brightly wrapped present just waiting to be opened. &lt;i&gt;Ebb Finds His Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a coming of age story as a young troll discovers the importance of friendship and how to believe in himself. Its also a coloring book, so children can create Ebbs world in their own imagination, with more Ebb books to come!&lt;/p&gt;" />
