  <title>Mia and the Bad Boy - Lisa Burstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Mia and the Bad Boy&lt;/i&gt; is what the young adult genre should be made of! A story full of heart and humor with the right mixture of romance throughout. I loved the friendship that blossoms between Mia and Ryder, and seeing it develop into more. I will absolutely be reading more from the Crush line, and more of Lisa Burstein!&quot; &lt;b&gt;-Jessica, Thoughts at One in the Morning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryder Brooks is living the dream--he&#39;s famous, loved by millions of girls, and miserable. All he really wants is to write his own music, not Seconds to Juliet&#39;s sugary sweet pop. In order to do that, though, the &quot;bad boy&quot; of the band will have to play by the rules. And that includes behaving with his new--and super cute--über-good-girl tutor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mia Reyes is in fangirl heaven. Tutoring her favorite member of her favorite band? It&#39;s a dream come true...until it turns into a complete nightmare. Ryder is nothing like she thought. He&#39;s crude, arrogant, and pretty much a total jerk. And the worst part? She&#39;s roped into pretending to be his girlfriend so that no one finds out he&#39;s being tutored. Fake kisses, plenty of PDA, and even&lt;i&gt; sharing his hotel room...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But sometimes even the baddest of bad boys needs a little redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains adult language, underage drinking, sexual situations, and lots of swoons. It may convince even the good-est of good girls to go bad.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Backstage Pass Series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Aimee and the Heartthrob&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Mia and the Bad Boy&lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Daisy and the Front Man&lt;br&gt;Book #4 - Anya and the Shy Guy&lt;br&gt;Book #5 - Abby and the Cute One&lt;/p&gt;" />
