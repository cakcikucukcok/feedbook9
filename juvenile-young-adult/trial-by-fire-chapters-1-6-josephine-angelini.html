      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Free! Download the first six chapters of &lt;i&gt;Trial By Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the first in a new trilogy by internationally bestselling author Josephine Angelini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This world is trying to kill Lily Proctor. Her life-threatening allergies keep her from enjoying experiences that others in her hometown of Salem take for granted, which is why she is determined to enjoy her first high school party with her best friend and longtime crush, Tristan. But after a humiliating incident in front of half her graduating class, Lily wishes she could just disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Lily is in a different Salem--one overrun with horrifying creatures and ruled by powerful women called Crucibles. Strongest and cruelest of them all is Lillian . . . Lily&#39;s other self in this alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Josephine Angelini&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Trial by Fire&lt;/i&gt;, what makes Lily weak at home is what makes her extraordinary in New Salem. In this confusing world, Lily is torn between responsibilities she can&#39;t hope to shoulder alone and a love she never expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
