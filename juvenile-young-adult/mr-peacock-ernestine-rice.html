  <title>Mr. Peacock - Ernestine Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was growing up, parents would read stories to put their toddlers to sleep. That encouraged me to write something that both toddlers and young people would enjoy reading. Some stories are funny and others have an uplifting spirit. Letting them know, no matter how different you are, theres always a common ground between the different cultures that will bring us all to a comfortable place in this world. 
My book is intended to give the readers a word of inspiration that would give them a caring spirit and help those that are in need and those that just need to be understood. There is no shame in being different. 
The intention of this book is to remind our young people how to show respect to others, embrace each other in time of difficulty, give love unconditionally to each other, and respect each others ideas. Therefore, we must learn to live with each other without a competitive spirit. Love thy neighbors as thyself. If we can do this as young people, what a wonderful world this would be.
 I choose the species of different fowls and animals as an example. If they can come together and get along and be supportive of each other, now you tell me, What is our problem?" />
