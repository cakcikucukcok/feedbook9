      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;In Free To Be Me, we meet Moriah a trusting, innocent baby elephant who looks forward to unwrapping each days adventures with enthusiasm and wonderment. One evening in a dream, Moriah learns that life may have some unexpected circumstances and unforeseen forces that wish to hold her back from pursuing the life she was created to live. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a moment of despair Moriah is visited by the wind which teaches her the purpose and the meaning of her life. She learns that God made her for a purpose which only she can fulfill. Can Moriah find the courage and faith to follow Gods dream for her life? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that Free to Be Me will encourage readers of all ages to pursue Gods dream for their lives with the wonder, fascination and trusting faith of a child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For I know the plans I have for you ,says the Lord, plans to prosper you not to harm you, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the Lord, and will bring you back from captivity. &lt;br /&gt;Jeremiah 29:11-14&lt;/div&gt;" />
