  <title>McALISTER&#39;S WAY - Free Serialisation Vol. 01 - Richard Marman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Zach McAlister&amp;rsquo;s mother is sick and due to go into hospital for an operation. To &amp;ldquo;get him out the way&amp;rdquo; his father puts him on a flight to Merimbula, New South Wales, Australia where he is met by his Grandfather Danny McAlister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Out on his Grandfather&amp;rsquo;s ranch, or what&amp;rsquo;s left of it, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take Zach long to become bored silly. Hunting around for things to do, he finds a box of old photos and a strip of six medals hidden away. The photos were mostly dog-eared and ragged at the edges. Mostly they were of young blokes hanging around tanks and military stuff, and there were lots of choppers. You know, those beat up ones you see in all the war movies. When he looked closer he realised that most of the guys in the photos didn&amp;rsquo;t look much older than Zach himself! And then there were the letters from a woman named Angela.&lt;br /&gt;
He takes the box to his Grandfather and asks him about the medals and the photos, and that&amp;rsquo;s where our story starts, well kind off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
