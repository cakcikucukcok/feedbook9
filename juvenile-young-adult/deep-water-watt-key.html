  <title>Deep Water - Watt Key</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Watt Key, the author of the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Alabama Moon&lt;/i&gt;, comes a thrilling middle grade survival story about a scuba dive gone wrong and two enemies who must unite to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s the most important rule of scuba diving: If you don&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t go down.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after her father falls ill, twelve-year-old Julie Sims must take over and lead two of his clients on a dive miles off the coast of Alabama while her father stays behind in the boat. When the clients, a reckless boy Julie&#39;s age and his equally foolhardy father, disregard Julie&#39;s instructions during the dive, she quickly realizes she&#39;s in over her head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once she surfaces, things only get worse: One of the clients is in serious condition, and their dive boat has vanished--along with Julie&#39;s father, the only person who knows their whereabouts. It&#39;s only a matter of time before they die of hypothermia, unless they become shark bait first. Though Julie may not like her clients, it&#39;s up to her to save them all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
