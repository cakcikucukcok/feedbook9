  <title>Secret Agent Disco Dancer: The Last Ding Dong on Earth - Scott Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fresh from stumbling across Double Agent Orangegrove and the mysterious Earth 2 project, SECRET AGENT DISCO DANCER realizes that he&amp;#39;s having trouble remembering things...well anything, for that matter...outside of his world class love for Twinkies. When he learns that the Hostess factory is shutting down for good and may have produced its last Ding Dong, he realizes that the world has a crisis on its hands, one that he intends to rectify once he obtains the proper clearance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FROGWART FISK has escaped from his maximum holding cell and set his diabolical mind on taking advantage of the impending Hostess shortage. With the proper assets, he intends to craft the most marvelous snack cake the world has ever seen, complete with mind-altering nanotechnology baked into it. Might the fall of the mighty snack cake be followed by world governments shortly thereafter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EARNEST BACON would like nothing better than to rid the agency of a certain frog from its ranks. When the opportunity arises to throw him in the slammer and strip any chance of obtaining a high-level clearance, Earnest jumps all over it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it&amp;#39;s hard to keep a good frog down, particularly this disco-dancing frog...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approximately 12,000 words. Descriptions of my other popular children&amp;#39;s books are included after the main feature (an additional 5 pages).&lt;br /&gt;
