  <title>Daring the Bad Boy - Monica Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Monica Murphy always delivers the swoon-worthy romance that I crave. And Murphy&#39;s latest is no exception with this first love, mature young adult novel&lt;i&gt;: Daring the Bad Boy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; -&lt;b&gt;Debbie, I Heart YA Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie McFarland is sick of being a shy nobody. A session at summer camp seems like the perfect opportunity to reinvent herself--gain some confidence, kiss a boy, be whoever she wants to be. A few days in, she&#39;s already set her sights on 端ber-hottie Kyle. Too bad her fear of water keeps her away from the lake, where Kyle is always hanging out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob Fazio is at Camp Pine Ridge after one too many screw-ups. Junior counseling seems like punishment enough, but the rigid no-fraternizing-with-campers rules harsh his chill. When a night of Truth or Dare gets him roped into teaching Annie how to swim, she begs him to also teach her how to snag Kyle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late-night swim sessions turn into late-night kissing sessions...but there&#39;s more on the line than just their hearts. If they get caught, Jake&#39;s headed straight to juvie, but Annie&#39;s more than ready to dare him to reveal the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains references to drinking, sexual situations, adult language, and an intense bad boy hero who will melt your heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Endless Summer Series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Daring the Bad Boy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Keeping Her Secret&lt;/p&gt;" />
