  <title>Anna Was Here - Jane Kurtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ten-year-old Anna Nickel is moving from Colorado to Kansas, and she is not happy about leaving her friends behind! This is a moving, often humorous coming-of-age story about family, faith, God&amp;#39;s love, and the meaning of home, perfect for fans of Katherine Paterson and &lt;em&gt;The Penderwicks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten-year-old Anna Nickel&amp;#39;s worst nightmare has come true. Her father has decided to move the family back to Oakwood, Kansas&amp;#8212;where he grew up&amp;#8212;in order to become the minister of the church there. New friends, new school, a new community, and a family of strangers await, and what&amp;#39;s even worse, it&amp;#39;s all smack-dab in the middle of Tornado Alley. Anna has always prided herself on being prepared (she keeps a notebook on how to cope with disasters, from hurricanes to shark bites), but she&amp;#39;ll be tested in Oakwood! This beautifully written novel introduces a family who takes God&amp;#39;s teachings to heart while finding many occasions to laugh along the way, and an irrepressible and wholesome ten-year-old who, with a little help from Midnight H. (her cat), takes control of her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
