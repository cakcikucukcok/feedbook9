  <title>Another Time - Jodie M. Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been two years since Rebecca escaped a government compound, concluding that she left no other survivors. With her husband, and two kids, even in hiding, she planned to leave the past behind her, because the past was nothing but experiments and pain. Her powerful dreams were not her fault; she was born that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is driven to make her new life work.  Lately, however, Rebecca has been having new dreams. This  nightmare life threatens the current equilibrium of her tenuous real life; it threatens her marriage, because she knows, deep down, that Chase fears herfears what she can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought the agency was destroyed with the destruction of the compound. She was wrong. The same people who once held her captive are tracking her again, and theyre closer than she thinks. Now, someone else walks within her dreams. Will Rebecca keep control of her mind, or will her powers destroy everything she has come to love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
