  <title>The Birthday Chronicles - Tim Healy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Henry is just old enough to begin to learn about love and truth, trust and sharing. Thats why Dad has decided to take Henry on an adventure, something Dad does when Henry needs to see something for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its time for Henry to go with Dad to the Forest of Inside-Out. The Forest of Inside-Out is a very special place, where even the animals can talk (its how they get whats inside them out). In the Forest of Inside-Out you can only tell the truth, and you have to see and deal with things, for yourself, exactly as they are. Henry gets to find out whats inside Henry and those who love him, and how that makes him feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the adventure unfolds, Henry learns the value of listening to his Dads voice, even if he cant see him. Dad tells Henry about Helpers, too. Of course, allowing himself to be helped and becoming a helper is a decision Henry will have to make for himself as the adventure of his life continues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Healy, lives in a small town in northeastern Connecticut, USA, not far from the Forest of Inside-Out, with his lovely wife Chris. Their grandson Henry is the loving focus of this book and all those to follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
