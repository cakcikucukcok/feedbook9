  <title>IT’S YOUR FAIRY TALE YOU KNOW - A Fairytale Adventure - Elizabeth Rhodes Jackson, Illustrated by L. E. W. Kattelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all little boys and girls who love fairies and pixies. Here we have a story about a boy named Wendell, who lives in Boston and likes fairy stories and baseball MUCH more than he likes fractions &amp;ndash; but he does like reading and can be found in the children&amp;rsquo;s section of the library on most days.&lt;br /&gt;
He even checked fairytale books out of the library and took them home with him. At night his parents had to take the books away from him as he was quite often found in the early hours of the morning reading a book under his covers with a torch.&lt;br /&gt;
Then Wendell reads about the Wishing Stone. On making enquiries he finds it is no longer where his book said it would be and he starts to make enquiries as to its current whereabouts &amp;ndash; and so starts Wendell&amp;rsquo;s adventure across Boston and into the land of Fairydom.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is sure to keep you and your young ones enchanted for hours, if not because of the quantity, then their quality. They will have you coming back for more time and again.&lt;br /&gt;
