  <title>Sisters of the Sword 3: Journey Through Fire - Maya Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a samurai&#39;s most dangerous opponent is herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since their father&#39;s murder, Kimi and Hana have honed their fighting skills and prepared for vengeance against their vicious uncle Hidehira. They have become true warriors with the hearts of samurai. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now their fight has become more than just a personal vendetta. As Hidehira&#39;s quest for power continues, he is destroying the province and is poised to invade the rest of the kingdom. After both girls are nearly killed in a fire while fighting their uncle&#39;s soldiers, their mother insists on attempting to enlist the support of the Shogun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the Shogun&#39;s court, the sisters are torn apart by their differences, especially when they rediscover an old friend with a shrouded past. Danger lurks in the most elegant circumstances&amp;#8212;behind the smiling face of an aristocrat as well as behind the mask of a ninja&amp;#8212;and true peril awaits the sisters where they least expect it. . . . &lt;/p&gt;" />
