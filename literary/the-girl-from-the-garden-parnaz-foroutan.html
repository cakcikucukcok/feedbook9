  <title>The Girl from the Garden - Parnaz Foroutan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary new writer makes her literary debut with this suspenseful novel of desire, obsession, power and vulnerability, in which a crisis of inheritance leads to the downfall of a wealthy family of Persian Jews in early twentieth-century Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all his wealth and success, Asher Malacouti&amp;#8212;the head of a prosperous Jewish family living in the Iranian town of Kermanshah&amp;#8212;cannot have the one thing he desires above all: a male son. His young wife Rakhel, trapped in an oppressive marriage at a time when a woman&amp;#8217;s worth is measured by her fertility, is made desperate by her failure to conceive, and grows jealous and vindictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her despair is compounded by her sister-in-law Khorsheed&amp;#8217;s pregnancy and her husband&amp;#8217;s growing desire for Kokab, his cousin&amp;#8217;s wife. Frustrated by his wife&amp;#8217;s inability to bear him an heir, Asher makes a fateful choice that will shatter the household and drive Rakhel to dark extremes to save herself and preserve her status within the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnessed through the memories of the family&amp;#8217;s only surviving daughter, Mahboubeh, now an elderly woman living in Los Angeles, &lt;em&gt;The Girl from the Garden&lt;/em&gt; unfolds the complex, tragic history of her family in a long-lost Iran of generations past. Haunting, suspenseful and inspired by events in the author&amp;#8217;s own family, it is an evocative and poignant exploration of sacrifice, betrayal, and the indelible legacy of the families that forge us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
