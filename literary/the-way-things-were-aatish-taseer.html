  <title>The Way Things Were - Aatish Taseer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absorbing family saga set amid the commotion of the last forty years of Indian history&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Way Things Were&lt;/i&gt; opens with the death of Toby, the Maharaja of Kalasuryaketu, a Sanskritist who has not set foot in India for two decades. Moving back and forth across three sections, between today&#39;s Delhi and the 1970s, &#39;80s, and &#39;90s in turn, the novel tells the story of a family held at the mercy of the times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     A masterful interrogation of the relationships between past and present and among individual lives, events, and culture, Aatish Taseer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Way Things Were&lt;/i&gt; takes its title from the Sanskrit word for history, &lt;i&gt;itihasa&lt;/i&gt;, whose literal translation is &quot;the way things indeed were.&quot; Told in prose that is at once intimate and panoramic, and threaded through with Sanskrit as central metaphor and chorus, this is a hugely ambitious and important book, alive to all the commotion of the last forty years but never losing its brilliant grasp on the current moment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
