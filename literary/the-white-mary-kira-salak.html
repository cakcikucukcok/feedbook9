  <title>The White Mary - Kira Salak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young woman journeys deep into the untamed jungle, wrestling with love and loss, trauma and healing, faith and redemption, in this sweeping debut from &quot;the gutsiest woman adventurer of our day&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Book Magazine&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marika Vecera, an accomplished war reporter, has dedicated her life to helping the world&#39;s oppressed and forgotten. When not on one of her dangerous assignments, she lives in Boston, exploring a new relationship with Seb, a psychologist who offers her glimpses of a better world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning from a harrowing assignment in the Congo where she was kidnapped by rebel soldiers, Marika learns that a man she has always admired from afar, Pulitzer-winning war correspondent Robert Lewis, has committed suicide. Stunned, she abandons her magazine work to write Lewis&#39;s biography, settling down with Seb as their intimacy grows. But when Marika finds a curious letter from a missionary claiming to have seen Lewis in the remote jungle of Papua New Guinea, she has to wonder, &lt;i&gt;What if Lewis isn&#39;t dead? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marika soon leaves Seb to embark on her ultimate journey in one of the world&#39;s most exotic and unknown lands. Through her eyes we experience the harsh realities of jungle travel, embrace the mythology of native tribes, and receive the special wisdom of Tobo, a witch doctor and sage, as we follow her extraordinary quest to learn the truth about Lewis--and about herself, along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
