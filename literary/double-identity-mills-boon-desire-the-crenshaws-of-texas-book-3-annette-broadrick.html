        &lt;p&gt;&quot;LOVE &#39;EM AND LEAVE &#39;EM&quot; WAS HIS SPECIALTY…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that made Jude Crenshaw the perfect man for this assignment. His blond, craggy good looks would make it easy for him to woo innocent, sweet Carina Patterson. The skilled secret agent knew he could secure the information he needed before anyone got hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Somehow lovely Carina had shaken him right down to his boots. Now, doing his job meant betraying her trust, risking her heart, maybe destroying her family. But the one thing he &lt;em&gt;couldn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; do was walk away….&lt;/p&gt;
