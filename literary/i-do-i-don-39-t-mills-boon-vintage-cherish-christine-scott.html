        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Niki Adams had finally gotten her life together. She was about to be married to a handsome doctor who treated her like gold. Everything was going great–until Jack Sinclair came home, declaring that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was the one she should be marrying.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Niki had been in love with that rascal Jack her whole life, but he&#39;d never seen her as a woman before. But now that she had a ring on her finger, he&#39;d had a sudden change of heart! It was enough to make a person tie her bridal veil in knots. But Jack seemed determined to make this willful bride his own….&lt;/p&gt;
