  <title>Neon in Daylight - Hermione Hoby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you get when a writer of extreme intelligence, insight, style and beauty chronicles the lives of self-absorbed hedonists—&lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bright Lights, Big City&lt;/i&gt;, and now &lt;i&gt;Neon in Daylight&lt;/i&gt;. Hermione Hoby paints a garish world that drew me in and held me spellbound. She is a marvel.&quot;  —Ann Patchett, author of &lt;i&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three lives collide in New York City in the summer of 2012. An exhilarating debut novel that announces the arrival of a writer who “channels the spirit of Joan Didion and the keen observational eye of Ben Lerner to show us the here and now.” (Alexandra Kleeman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City in 2012, the sweltering summer before Hurricane Sandy hits. Kate, a young woman newly arrived from England, is staying in a Manhattan apartment while she tries to figure out her future. She has two unfortunate responsibilities during her time in America: to make regular Skype calls to her miserable boyfriend back home, and to cat-sit an indifferent feline named Joni Mitchell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has other plans for her. In New York&#39;s parks and bodegas, its galleries and performance spaces, its bars and clubs crowded with bodies, Kate encounters two strangers who will transform her stay: Bill, a charismatic but embittered writer made famous by the movie version of his only novel; and Inez, his daughter, a recent high school graduate who supplements her Bushwick café salary by enacting the fantasies of men she meets on Craigslist. Unmoored from her old life, Kate falls into an infatuation with both of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in a heatwave that feels like it will never break, &lt;i&gt;Neon In Daylight&lt;/i&gt; marries deep intelligence with captivating characters to offer us a joyful, unflinching exploration of desire, solitude, and the thin line between life and art. &lt;/p&gt;" />
