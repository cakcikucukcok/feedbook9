  <title>Amongst Thieves - Quentin Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After serving 15 years in prison, Ramon Delay is back on the grimey streets of Kansas City, and the demons of his past are dragging him on a detour which may lead to a dead end. Ramon again finds himself amongst his loyal crew of thieves, who hold him down while mobbing his way to the top of one of Kansas City s most lucrative empires. But two women have their own agendas for Ramon Yawni, a 38-year-old diva with intentions of becoming wifey and Jayde, a 22-year-old sack-chaser whose seductive ploys weigh heavy on Ramon s pockets and wellbeing. After repeatedly neglecting the loyalty of his friends in pursuit of youth, fortune and fame, Ramon finds that even thieves must honor the code of the streets or pay the piper. When old friends turn to enemies and the streets greed comes calling, will Ramon realize if there is still honor Amongst Thieves?" />
