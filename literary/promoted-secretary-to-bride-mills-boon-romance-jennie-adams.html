            &lt;em&gt;Mousy Molly Taylor has always been half in love with her boss! &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What was I thinking? As if a new dress and a pair of borrowed hopes-and-dreams shoes were going to get me noticed by my scrummy boss! After all, he has barely looked at me in the last three years, so why should he now? But last night, after Jarrod drove me home from that posh work party, things seemed different, and for one crazy moment I felt sure he was going to kiss me!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Oh, well, it will be back to business on Monday, and everything will go back to normal… But Molly’s boss has other things on his agenda!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Nine to Five From city girl to corporate wife!&lt;/em&gt;
