  <title>Imperium - Christian Kracht, Daniel Bowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An outrageous, fantastical, uncategorizable novel of obsession, adventure, and coconuts &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In 1902, a radical vegetarian and nudist from Nuremberg named August Engelhardt set sail for what was then called the Bismarck Archipelago. His destination: the island Kabakon. His goal: to found a colony based on worship of the sun and coconuts. His malnourished body was found on the beach on Kabakon in 1919; he was forty-three years old.&lt;br&gt;     Christian Kracht&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Imperium&lt;/i&gt; uses the outlandish details of Engelhardt&#39;s life to craft a fable about the allure of extremism and its fundamental foolishness. Engelhardt is at once a sympathetic outsider--mocked, misunderstood, physically assaulted--and a rigid ideologue, and his misguided notions of purity and his spiral into madness presage the horrors of the mid-twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;     Playing with the tropes of classic adventure tales like &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/i&gt;, Kracht&#39;s novel, an international bestseller, is funny, bizarre, shocking, and poignant--sometimes all on the same page. His allusions are misleading, his historical time lines are twisted, his narrator is unreliable--and the result is a novel that is also a mirror cabinet and a maze pitted with trapdoors. Both a provocative satire and a serious meditation on the fragility and audacity of human activity, &lt;i&gt;Imperium&lt;/i&gt; is impossible to categorize, and utterly unlike anything you&#39;ve read before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
