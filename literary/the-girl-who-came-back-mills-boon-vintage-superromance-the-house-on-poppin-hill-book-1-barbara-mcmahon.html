  <title>The Girl Who Came Back (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (The House on Poppin Hill, Book 1) - Barbara McMahon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Home, Sweet Home?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Eliza Shaw was sixteen, her life was torn apart. False accusations meant the only home she&#39;d ever known–a foster home–was destroyed, and she and her two foster sisters were separated. That same year, tragedy struck Cade Bennett, Eliza&#39;s first love, and it ruined their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Twelve years later Eliza returns to the small Mississippi town where she grew up. Seeing her childhood home brings back emotions Eliza hasn&#39;t felt in a long time, and she begins to search for her former foster sisters. Eliza can&#39;t ignore the feelings she still has for Cade, either, even though he blames her for his sister&#39;s death. But as the truth about the past begins to emerge, Cade and Eliza find themselves growing close. Maybe you really can go home again.&lt;/p&gt;
