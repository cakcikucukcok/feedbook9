  <title>The Heart Broke In - James Meek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From James Meek, the award-winning author of the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;The People&#39;s Act of Love&lt;/i&gt;, comes a rich and intricate novel about everything that matters to us now: children, celebrity, secrets and shame, the quest for youth, loyalty and betrayal, falls from grace, acts of terror, and the wonderful, terrible inescapability of family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ritchie Shepherd, an aging pop star and a producer of a reality show for teen talent, is starting to trip over his own lies. Maybe filming a documentary about his father, Captain Shepherd, a British soldier executed by Northern Irish guerrillas, will redeem him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His sister, Bec, is getting closer and closer to a vaccine for malaria. When she&#39;s not in Tanzania harvesting field samples, she&#39;s peering through a microscope at her own blood to chart the risky treatment she&#39;s testing on herself. She&#39;s as addicted to honesty as Ritchie is to trickery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Val Oatman is the editor of a powerful tabloid newspaper. The self-appointed conscience of the nation, scourge of hypocrites and cheats, he believes he will marry beautiful Bec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Comrie, a gene therapist (and formerly the drummer in Ritchie&#39;s band), is battling his mortally ill uncle, a brilliant and domineering scientist, over whether Alex might actually have discovered a cure for aging. Alex, too, believes he will marry Bec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colum O&#39;Donabháin has just been released from prison, having served a twenty-five-year sentence for putting a gun to Captain Shepherd&#39;s head when he refused to give up an informer. He now writes poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their stories meet and tangle in this bighearted epic that is also shrewd, starkly funny, and utterly of the moment. &lt;i&gt;The Heart Broke In &lt;/i&gt;is fiction with the reverberating resonance of truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
