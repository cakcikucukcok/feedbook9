  <title>Child of My Heart - Alice Mcdermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young girl&#39;s astonishing, poignant first look into the turbulent heart of things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had in my care that summer four dogs, three cats, the Moran kids, Daisy, my eight-year-old cousin, and Flora, the toddler child of a local artist. There was also, for a while, a litter of wild rabbits, three of them, that had been left under our back steps.... &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice McDermott&#39;s haunting and enchanting new work of fiction--her first since the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Charming Billy&lt;/i&gt;, winner of the 1998 National Book Award--is narrated by a woman who was born beautiful. Her parents decided that her best chance in life was to marry a wealthy man, so she was raised on the east end of Long Island, among the country houses of the rich.  On the cusp of fifteen, she is the town&#39;s most sought-after babysitter--cheerful, beloved, a wonder with children and animals, but also a solitary soul with an already complex understanding of human nature--when her favorite cousin, Daisy, comes to spend the summer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The narrator&#39;s witty, piquant, deeply etched evocation of all that was really transpiring under the surface during that seemingly idyllic season gives her wry tale--infused with suppressed passion, disappointment, and enduring hope--its remarkable vividness and impact. Once again, Alice McDermott explores the mysterious depths of what seems like everyday life with unforgettable insight and resonant emotional power.&lt;/p&gt;" />
