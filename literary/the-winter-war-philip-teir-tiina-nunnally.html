  <title>The Winter War - Philip Teir, Tiina Nunnally</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the Paul family are living the liberal, middle-class Scandinavian dream. Max Paul is a renowned sociologist and his wife Katriina has a well-paid job in the public sector. They live in an airy apartment in the centre of Helsinki. But look closer and the cracks start to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he approaches his sixtieth birthday, the certainties of Max&#39;s life begin to dissolve. He hasn&#39;t produced any work of note for decades. His wife no longer loves him. His grown-up daughters &amp;#8212; one in London, one in Helsinki &amp;#8212; have problems of their own. So when a former student turned journalist shows up and offers him a seductive lifeline, Max starts down a dangerous path from which he may never find a way back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny, sharp, and brilliantly truthful, Teir&#39;s debut has the feel of a big, contemporary, humane American novel, but with a distinctly Scandinavian edge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
