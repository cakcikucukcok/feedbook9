  <title>Trouble in Tennessee (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Tanya Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;People who knew Treble James called her Trouble. Although she&#39;d returned to Joyous, Tennessee, to help her sister through a rough pregnancy, the townsfolk expected their former wild child to get bored and run back to Atlanta long before the baby was born.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even the town&#39;s new doctor was worried Treble&#39;s antics would upset not only the mother-to-be, but her ailing stepfather. Keith Caldwell might be handsome and worldly, but he loved the quiet town of Joyous precisely because it was safe and predictable. And after what he&#39;d been through, he wanted to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keith starts to change his opinion on the benefits of peace and quiet when things heat up between him and Treble. But is the big-city girl going to leave him in the lurch, or will she stay in her former hometown and put the &#39;joy&#39; back into Keith&#39;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
