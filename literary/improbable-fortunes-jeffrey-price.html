  <title>Improbable Fortunes - Jeffrey Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Improbable Fortunes&lt;/I&gt;, Jeffrey Price takes us on a wild ride into Vanadium, a dusty, down-on-its-heels mining town in southwest Colorado&amp;#151;where it would be fair to assume that nothing has ever happened. But you&amp;#8217;d be wrong. As it turns out, quite a lot has happened starting with a suspicious mudslide that destroys the town&amp;#8217;s Main Street and a cowboy, Buster McCaffrey, arrested for the death of one of the richest men in America, Marvin Mallomar.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the soon-to-retire Sheriff, Shep Dudival, investigates the circumstances surrounding the murder, it comes to light that Buster and Mallomar&amp;#8217;s young wife were having a Cowboy Always Rings Twice affair. From there, Price takes this familiar story plot and turns it on its head&amp;#151;folding a rococo cast of Vanadium&amp;#8217;s characters into a timeline that begins with Vanadium&amp;#8217;s post WWII labor strife and ends with the Kulturkampf of present day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While it may all seem humorous and surreal at first blush, one gets the feeling by &lt;I&gt;Improbable Fortunes&#39;&lt;/I&gt; un-guessable conclusion, that Price has used the fictitious town of Vanadium&amp;#151;a place without a recognizable gas station, a decent restaurant, or a clean bathroom&amp;#151;as the Rosetta Stone for something larger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
