          &lt;strong&gt;BRIDE? WHAT BRIDE?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joe Camden came home to Alaska to find a bride and two adorable kids on his doorstep. Chynna Sinclair claimed she and her brood were his mail-order family, but when Joe tried to explain that it was his brother who&#39;d sent for a new wife, the feisty beauty wouldn&#39;t hear it. And now she was determined to marry him!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chynna hadn&#39;t traveled all this way with her babies only to have her dreams dashed by the sexiest man she&#39;d ever laid eyes on. It no longer mattered to her which bachelor she was supposed to wed - the only man Chynna wanted to share the marriage bed with was Joe!&lt;/p&gt;
