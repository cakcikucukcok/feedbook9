          &lt;strong&gt;An Offer She Couldn&#39;t Refuse?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When powerful Brent Akerman announced his intention to close down his chain of fashion accessory shops, somebody had to ask him to reconsider. Crystal was elected. Brent was open to suggestions and he didn&#39;t pull any punches - he liked Crystal, respected her talents and wanted to hire her for other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was also clear that he wouldn&#39;t mind mixing business with pleasure. Crystal&#39;s feelings ran deep for the sexy man she no longer considered a stranger, but dare she use their mutual attraction as a negotiating tool?&lt;/p&gt;
