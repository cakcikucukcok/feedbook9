  <title>An Apprentice Dictator in the White House - Abner Clerveaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young, handsome, charismatic Southern governor is elected president of the United States in a landslide. He was so popular that world leaders were scrambling to attend his inauguration. Among the attendees were the pope, the queen of England, and other royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had, however, an Achilles&amp;rsquo; heel&amp;mdash;he was a philanderer. It will not take long for his misdeeds to leak out to the media and the opposition party.
