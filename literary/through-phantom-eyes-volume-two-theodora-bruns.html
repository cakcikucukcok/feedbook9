  <title>Through Phantom Eyes: Volume Two - Theodora Bruns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Erik is ten-years-old when he wakes in the middle of a tragedy that will forever change his life. His guiding force, his father, is dead, and his shattered heart is inconsolable. While struggling with his grief over his loss, he discovers the people in his home town want him institutionalized, creating unbridled fears in his young heart. His anger rages against the men responsible for his father&#39;s death, adding a third dimension to his dilemma. &lt;p&gt;
Deciding to safeguard his freedom, he leaves his home and, with brave determination, ventures toward the musical conservatory in Venice, Italy-the goal fashioned by his father&#39;s loving guidance. But along the way, he meets with unexpected trials that waylay his dreams. Some people he encounters are cruel beyond his imagination, and he, on many occasions, barely escapes with his life. &lt;p&gt;
While most people are heartless, there are a few kind souls who have compassion for poor Erik. With their kindness, and Erik&#39;s undaunted courage, he surmounts all odds and continues toward his goal of unadulterated music. &lt;p&gt;
Join Erik on this second leg of his journey toward becoming known as the Phantom of the Opera." />
