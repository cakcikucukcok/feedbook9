  <title>The Million-Dollar Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Eva Rutland</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Whirlwind Weddings&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;For richer, for poorer…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tony Costello adored Melody. He loved her warmth, her bubbly sense of humor…. There were a million reasons to marry her. Thirty million to be precise–in dollars! Except Tony hadn&#39;t known about his bride&#39;s fortune. And he couldn&#39;t forgive her for it–for being rich and for keeping it a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Melody knew Tony was a proud man. How could she tell him that she had more money in the bank than he could earn in a lifetime? He was everything she&#39;d ever wanted in a husband, and saving their marriage was all that mattered. Rich or poor, she loved Tony. She just had to prove it!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Who says you can&#39;t hurry love?&lt;/strong&gt;
