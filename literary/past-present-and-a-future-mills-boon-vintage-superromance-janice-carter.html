          &lt;strong&gt;He was her first love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At Twin Falls High School, Gil Harper and Clare Morgan were inseparable–until the murder of a classmate tore their world, and their relationship, apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gil was a prime suspect in the murder, and although he was quickly cleared of all charges, Clare was never sure why Gil hadn&#39;t told her the whole story of his relationship with Rina Thomas. Their trust was shattered, and their plans for the future were buried along with the truth about Rina&#39;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, years later, Clare returns to her hometown, where she is troubled by thoughts of what might have been. Could she and Gil have lived &quot;happily ever after,&quot; like her friends Laura and Dave? Clare is finally getting a chance to find out….&lt;/p&gt;
