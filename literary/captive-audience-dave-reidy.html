From the opening story, the award-winning &amp;#147;The Regular,&amp;#8221; where two lonely music fans bond over a most unusual kind of karaoke, to the final tale, &quot;Dancing Man&quot; about an organ player who gets his big break in the most unexpected way with the band REM, this bittersweet and humorous collection gives voice to those who are driven to perform, no matter the size of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dave Reidy&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s fiction has been published by &lt;I&gt;Granta &lt;/I&gt;and his story &quot;The Regular&quot; was chosen by Charles D&#39;Ambrosio as winner of the Emerging Writers Network Short Fiction Contest. &lt;I&gt;Captive Audience&lt;/I&gt;, a collection of short stories about performers and Reidy&#39;s first book, has been named an Indie Next Notable Book by the American Booksellers Association and a New and Noteworthy Book by &lt;I&gt;Poets &amp; Writers &lt;/I&gt;magazine.
