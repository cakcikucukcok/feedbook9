  <title>Fight For Love (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She had come to take his inheritance. Natasha Ames wasn&#39;t surprised that Jay Travers resented her presence on his family&#39;s Texas ranch. Not after she learned that his grandfather, who had met Natasha on a trip to England, had left her half of his property in his will.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Natasha didn&#39;t know why the shrewd old Texan had made such a bequest to a virtual stranger, but she was determined not to leave until she found out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t easy living with Jay&#39;s hostility - especially when Natasha found herself falling in love with the harsh rancher.&lt;/p&gt;
