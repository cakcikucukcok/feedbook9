  <title>Wait, Blink - Gunnhild Øyehaug, Kari Dickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Expansive, intimate, and filled to the brim with delight, Gunnhild Oyehaug&#39;s first novel is devoted to the unexpected connections between lonesome individuals, mundane rituals, jellyfish, death, oversized men&#39;s shirts, and a thousand other things too astonishing to spoil in this sentence. I truly loved this wide-eyed, all-embracing wonder of a book.&quot; --Alexandra Kleeman, author of &lt;i&gt;You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Sigrid is a young literature student trying to find her voice as a writer when she falls in love with an older, established author, whose lifestyle soon overwhelms her values and once-clear vision. Trine has reluctantly become a mother and struggles to create as a performance artist. The aspiring movie director Linnea scouts locations in Copenhagen for a film she will never make. As these characters&#39; stories collide and intersect, they find that dealing with the pressures of their lives also means coming to grips with a world both frightening and joyously ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wait, Blink&lt;/i&gt; combines wild associations, quotations, coincidences, and other peculiar details into a unique tale that is both humorous and profound. Full of the playfulness that drew acclaim for her story collection &lt;i&gt;Knots&lt;/i&gt;, Gunnhild Øyehaug&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Wait, Blink&lt;/i&gt;--her first novel to be translated into English--is a jolt of desire and fantasy, romance and regret: a fable about what it means to own up to the weirdness inside us all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
