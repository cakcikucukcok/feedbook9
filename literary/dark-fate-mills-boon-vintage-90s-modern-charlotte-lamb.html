          &lt;strong&gt;A Marriage of Minds…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s fate - even when we&#39;re miles apart the link between us holds!&quot; Saskia thought that two years was long enough to confirm that she would never be reunited with her estranged husband, Domenico. But it seemed there was no end to the strange bond that had existed between them: Domenico was waiting for her when she arrived on vacation in Venice!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Saskia had always had the uncanny ability to read Domenico&#39;s mind, so she was unnerved to find that now he, too, knew what she was thinking. Once again, she was somehow tied to him physically and mentally, and there seemed to be no escape. Except that, in Domenico&#39;s eyes, a happy marriage should be completed with children… .&lt;/p&gt;
