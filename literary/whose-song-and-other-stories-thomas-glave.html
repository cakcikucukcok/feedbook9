  <title>Whose Song?: And Other Stories - Thomas Glave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;#147;Thomas Glave walks the path of such greats in American literature as Richard Wright and James Baldwin while forging new ground of his own. His voice is strong and his technique dazzling as he cuts to the bone of what it means to be black in America, white in America, gay in America, and human in the world at large. These stories span the globe of the human experience and the human heart. They are brutal in some places, tender in others, but always honestly told. A true talent of the 21st century.&quot;  &amp;#151; Gloria Naylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Author Thomas Glave is known for his stylistic brio and courageous explorations into the heavily mined territories of race and sexuality. This searing collection of stories is a stunning debut of a writer the &lt;I&gt;Village Voice&lt;/I&gt; has named &quot;One to Watch.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Thomas Glave has the strong talent and courage to take up the right to enter the inner seves of both black and white characters in his stories. This is a creative claim beyond &#39;authenticity&#39; determined by skin color. He also hasa that essential writer&#39;s ear for the way different people speak within their cultures, and wha their idiom gives away of their inhibitions and affirmations.&quot; &amp;#151; Nadine Gordimer&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;What a writer! What a book! Glave is a brilliant writer of startlingly fresh prose . . . his stories are intricate tapestries of life rendered through a triumphant act of the imagination.&quot; &amp;#151; Clarence Major&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Glave is an extraordinary stylist, whose rare insight, boundless courage, and fierce imagination make these stories resound long after you turn the last page. . . .
