  <title>The Seal&#39;s Surprise Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Amy J. Fetzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;One perfect night, the passion Navy SEAL Jack Singer had felt for Melanie Patterson had burst the seams of his restraint.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But then he&#39;d been called away on a top-secret assignment. Returning home fifteen months later, he was shocked to discover that she&#39;d delivered his baby. Honorable Jack knew marriage was the only solution - because no way would he let his child grow up without a father!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Duty and desire were not enough to build a marriage on, and Melanie refused to be any man&#39;s ball and chain. Yet how could she deny her little girl a daddy? And how much longer could Melanie deny her fierce attraction to the man who threatened to scale her defenses and melt her resolve?&lt;/p&gt;
