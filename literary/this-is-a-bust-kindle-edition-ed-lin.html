  <title>This Is a Bust Kindle Edition - Ed Lin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;This Is a Bust&lt;/I&gt;, the second novel by award-winning author Ed Lin, turns the conventions of hard-boiled pulp stories on their head by exploring the unexotic and very real complexities of New York City&#39;s Chinatown, circa 1976, through the eyes of a Chinese-American cop. A Vietnam vet and an alcoholic, Robert Chow&#39;s troubles are compounded by the fact that he&#39;s basically community-relations window-dressing for the NYPD: he&#39;s the only Chinese American on the Chinatown beat, and the only police officer who can speak Cantonese, but he&#39;s never assigned anything more challenging than appearances at store openings or community events. Chow is willing to stuff down his feelings and hang tight for a promotion to the detective track, despite the community unrest that begins to roil around him. But when his superiors remain indifferent to an old Chinese woman&#39;s death, he is forced to take matters into his own hands. &lt;I&gt;This Is a Bust&lt;/I&gt; is at once a murder mystery, a noir homage and a devastating, uniquely nuanced portrait of a neighborhood in flux, stuck between old rivalries and youthful idealism.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;This is the eBook edition of &lt;I&gt;This Is a Bust&lt;/I&gt;, originally published in print form in November 2007.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
