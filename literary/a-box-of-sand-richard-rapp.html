  <title>A Box of Sand - Richard Rapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam Brandeis is a desperate yet determined man when he makes a life-changing decision to leave his homeland where Cossacks are killing and raping Jews. After he and his wife, Eva, say their last prayer on the Sabbath from their shtetl, they escape with their young daughter on a ship bound for New York City, where Sam secures work and a home in Manhattan. After a horrible tragedy takes the life of a dear friend, Sam and Eva relocate to Brooklyn where he builds a successful business. As his family grows and Sam ages to become a grandfather for the first time, there is no question that Sam has realized the American dream.&lt;p&gt;
Richard Rapp spends his youth within the shadow of his grandfathers wisdom, love, and genius, as their shared philosophies, hopes, and dreams for America and Palestine strengthen their kinship. When Richard turns twenty, he joins the struggle for an Israeli state despite his parents objections, where he soon finds love, his true identity, and a purpose he cannot wait to share with his grandfather.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A Box of Sand&lt;/i&gt; is a historical tale based in part on real-life experiences as a young man is helped on his journey of self-discovery by the wisdom and strength of his grandfather." />
