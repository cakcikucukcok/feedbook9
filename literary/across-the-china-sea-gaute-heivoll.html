  <title>Across the China Sea - Gaute Heivoll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An atmospheric and affecting novel set in rural Norway, by the award-winning author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before I Burn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In the waning days of the German occupation of Norway, Karin and her  husband move from Oslo to a tiny village in the south with their young  son, the narrator. There they aim to live out their dream of caring for  those who can&#39;t look after themselves. They have spent months building a  modest house with rooms for patients, and it&#39;s soon filled with three  adult men who are psychologically unstable--including Karin&#39;s uncle Josef, who suffered a head injury in a carriage accident--and five  siblings whose parents have been declared unfit, and who are the subjects of much  conversation in the village. This small and idiosyncratic  community persists for nearly three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his parents&#39; deaths, the son returns to clean out this unusual home. The objects of  his childhood retain a talisman-like power over him, and key objects--including an  orange crate where he and his sister slept as infants,  Josef&#39;s medal of honor, his mother&#39;s beloved piano, and many  others--unlock vivid memories. In recounting the ways that the siblings  both are and are not a part of his family, he reveals his special  relationship with Ingrid, who cannot speak, and his sister&#39;s accidental death,  which occurred when they were playing together, and its quiet yet  tragic effects on the extended family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With warmth, gentle  humor, and deep compassion, Gaute Heivoll portrays an unconventional  family as it navigates an uncertain and often unkind world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
