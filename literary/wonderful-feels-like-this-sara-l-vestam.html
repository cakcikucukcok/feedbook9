  <title>Wonderful Feels Like This - Sara Lövestam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sara Lovestam&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Wonderful Feels Like This &lt;/i&gt;is &quot;a coming-of-age tale of a young artist and is as soulful as it is triumphant&quot; (&lt;i&gt;SLJ&lt;/i&gt;) that celebrates being a little bit odd, finding your people, and the power of music to connect us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;For Steffi, going to school everyday is an exercise in survival. She&#39;s never fit in with any of the groups at school, and she&#39;s viciously teased by the other girls in her class. The only way she escapes is through her music--especially jazz music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Steffi hears her favorite jazz song playing through an open window of a retirement home on her walk home from school, she decides to go in and introduce herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old man playing her favorite song is Alvar. When Alvar was a teenager in World War II Sweden, he dreamed of being in a real jazz band. Then and now, Alvar&#39;s escape is music--especially jazz music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their unconventional but powerful friendship, Steffi comes to realize that she won&#39;t always be stuck and lonely in her town. She can go to music school in Stockholm. She can be a &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;musician. She can be a jitterbug, just like Alvar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can Steffi convince her parents to let her go to Stockholm to audition? And how it that Steffi&#39;s school, the retirement home, the music, and even Steffi&#39;s worst bully are somehow all connected to Alvar? Can it be that the people least like us are the ones we need to help us tell our own stories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sensitive and deeply moving: outstanding.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Empathy, identity, and the transformative power of music bind this tale of an atypical friendship between a teenage outcast and a jazz musician.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
