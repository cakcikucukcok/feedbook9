  <title>Gang Slayer - Mike Axelrod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gangs are responsible for over 80 percent of the crime in the United States. The cost of gang violence is staggering. In many communities, no one feels safe walking down his or her own streetsand that, Dan Googen feels, is simply too high a cost to pay.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dan was a soldier, trained in combat overseas. When he returns home to see that his own neighborhood is held captive by a violent invasion force of its own, he springs into action. He goes undercover and begins to live the gangland life. What he doesnt count on is how his life will be affected by the friendships he forms with the members of the gangs. His new secret life is in bitter conflict with his ideals and goals. Can he do what needs to be doneor will these new friendships test his resolve?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;While living undercover, Dan befriends Tiny, one of the gang members. With Dans help, Tiny is able to accomplish the unthinkable: he breaks free from the gangs and enrolls in college. There, he becomes a breakout basketball star; his life is now on an unstoppably positive path. When Tinys dreams of playing pro ball finally come true, he makes good on his promise to help the kids he left behind in the hood. He comes home, a local hero determined to do anything he can to help.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tiny receives the answer to his prayers  but not the one he expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
