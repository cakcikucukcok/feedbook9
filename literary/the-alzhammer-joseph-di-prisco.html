  <title>The Alzhammer - Joseph Di Prisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Mikey is history. He&amp;#8217;s got what he calls the Alzhammer. A once-powerful mob boss, he is seriously slipping&amp;#151;losing control of his crew and of his mind. His business is sideways, his rivals are coming for him, he&amp;#8217;s crazy forgetful, and it is a fact his parents suffered miserably with Alzheimer&#39;s. He refuses to ride diapered and drooling into the sunset. He is going to whack himself. Problem is, others are trying to whack him and rip off what&amp;#8217;s left of the family&amp;#8217;s business, which is different and which pisses him off&amp;#151;when he remembers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, his ex, Zayana, slips back into his life. She&amp;#8217;s been on the lam. Long ago, she hooked up with a rich, ruthless, and very married Senator who&#39;s concerned she might go public during election season, and he&amp;#8217;s prepared to do whatever it takes to eliminate her and save his image. Mikey decides to do the right thing for a change. They will hole up in the perfect hideaway&amp;#151;a shady, unlicensed nursing home near Vegas&amp;#151;until after the vote. Mikey&#39;s feelings for Z resurface, but even so, he figures once she and her son, who might be his, are safe, he will finally kill himself in peace. Until then, he must confront his would-be killers, the Senator, and the lunatic who cracks the whip at the three-ring-circus home called Over the Rainbow.&lt;/div&gt;" />
