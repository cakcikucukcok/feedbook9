  <title>When You Read This - Mary Adkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For fans of Maria Semple and Rainbow Rowell, a comedy-drama for the digital age: an epistolary debut novel about the ties that bind and break our hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iris Massey is gone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;But she&amp;#8217;s left something behind.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For four years, Iris Massey worked side by side with PR maven Smith Simonyi, helping clients perfect their brands. But Iris has died, taken by terminal illness at only thirty-three. Adrift without his friend and colleague, Smith is surprised to discover that in her last six months, Iris created a blog filled with sharp and often funny musings on the end of a life not quite fulfilled. She also made one final request: for Smith to get her posts published as a book. With the help of his charmingly eager, if overbearingly forthright, new intern Carl, Smith tackles the task of fulfilling Iris&amp;#8217;s last wish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he can do so, though, he must get the approval of Iris&amp;#8217; big sister Jade, an haute cuisine chef who&amp;#8217;s been knocked sideways by her loss. Each carrying their own baggage, Smith and Jade end up on a collision course with their own unresolved pasts and with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in a series of e-mails, blog posts, online therapy submissions, text messages, legal correspondence, home-rental bookings, and other snippets of our virtual lives, &lt;em&gt;When You Read This&lt;/em&gt; is a deft, captivating romantic comedy&amp;#8212;funny, tragic, surprising, and bittersweet&amp;#8212;that candidly reveals how we find new beginnings after loss. &lt;/p&gt;" />
