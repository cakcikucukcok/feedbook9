  <title>The Missing - A. W. Tautuaa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You hear about them almost every daybut do you really see them? The kid next to you could become one soon. You could become one soon. Your child could become one soon. You see them at the malls, shopping centers, in the newspapers, on the Internet, and on TVthe faces under the ominous title:
&lt;center&gt;MISSING&lt;/center&gt;
Perhaps we feel a little sorry for them, but most of us just walk on by. Theyre not you; theyre not yours. Why should you care? What if you knew what those missing people were going through?
Its not what you think. This is a story of one who volunteered to go because he had to.
Reunited with a childhood acquaintance, D is quite happy with his orphan life. But when the orphans caretaker, Sorkin, tries to use Ds childhood friend to commit an unspeakable act, D loses more than just his innocence. His entire orphan family is suddenly abducted, leaving him alone as the sole survivor. 
Determined to find his lost family, D embarks on a journey that will take him into the heart of the secret city of Sparta. There he will makeand losefriends, learn new skills, and struggle to keep his sanity, all to gain a power he never wanted.
D soon finds himself pulled into a secret world filled with conspiracy and many deceptions; he cannot imagine the truth he will soon come to know." />
