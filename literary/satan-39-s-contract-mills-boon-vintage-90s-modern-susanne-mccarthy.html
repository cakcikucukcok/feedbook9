  <title>Satan&#39;s Contract (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Susanne McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Your daughter can pay the debt for you - in my bed.&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was nothing Pippa could do to stop her parents from bartering with Shaun Morgan - using Pippa as the price. Shaun held all the aces: he&#39;d inherited the family fortune, and Pippa&#39;s father was in grave financial trouble. The only solution was if Pippa became Shaun&#39;s bride.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pippa&#39;s attraction to Shaun had turned into something deeper, but she knew he despised her and for him it could only be a marriage of convenience - though one of the utmost convenience, since Pippa was Shaun&#39;s surest means of getting his revenge… .&lt;/p&gt;
