  <title>The Affair - Alicia Clifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&quot;  --Leo Tolstoy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a writer, Celia Bayley&#39;s insights into the ways of the human heart made her famous. And why not? She had married a handsome war hero and produced three successful children. Yet, as her family gathers for her funeral, the diaries and notebooks and letters she left behind paint a very different picture, one that shocks those who loved her and will force them to confront the difficult conflicts in their own lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life torn by secrets is revealed. The husband she adored had deceived her early in their marriage and broken her heart, though they persevered as a family. Then, years later while on a trip with friends, she meets a man for whom she feels a passion she never believed possible. In one brief moment, her whole life is turned inside out. &lt;br&gt;Utterly compelling and beautifully written, &lt;i&gt;The Affair&lt;/i&gt; makes vividly real the agonizing choice one woman must make. Powerful and moving, the novel is about marriage, families, and the definition of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
