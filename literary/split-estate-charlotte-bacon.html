  <title>Split Estate - Charlotte Bacon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wonderfully tough-minded novel from a master dramatist of the poignant, interwoven crises of modern life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Split Estate &lt;/i&gt;opens with devastating scenes of a family at a horrific juncture: the wife of Arthur King and mother of his two teenage children, Celia and Cam, has recently committed suicide, jumping out the window of their New York apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Bacon&#39;s luminous new novel tracks the King family as it struggles to survive in the months that follow. Arthur, an attractive lawyer who has always been edgy about city dwelling, decides they must move back to his home state of Wyoming for the summer, where his mother, Lucy, welcomes her orphaned grandchildren and her wounded son to her much loved but diminished ranch. From the perspective of each protagonist in turn, we watch shy Celia and handsome Cam, distraught Arthur and brave Lucy face themselves and their future in a Wyoming that is beautiful and consoling, yet beset by new threats of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A split estate is a form of real property in which the mineral rights have been split off from the other land uses to which the owner is entitled. This has transformed the landscape the Kings love and jeopardized Lucy&#39;s independence. In truth, the Kings&#39; very lives have become split estates--for Celia, on the brink of adolescence; for Cam, approaching independent adulthood; for Arthur, divided between the West and New York. &lt;i&gt;Split Estate &lt;/i&gt;is a heartrending depiction of an American family sturggling to deal with irrevocable damage to their lives and surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
