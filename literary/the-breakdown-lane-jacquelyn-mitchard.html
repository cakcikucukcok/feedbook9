  <title>The Breakdown Lane - Jacquelyn Mitchard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where can a woman turn when her own life threatens to overwhelm her ability to keep her children safe? &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jacquelyn Mitchard takes the readers of her newest novel on a wry and moving journey of loss and healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving advice is what Julieanne does for a living -- every Sunday she doles it out to clueless people she doesn&#39;t know, in a column in her local Wisconsin paper. But when it comes to her personal life, Julie herself seems to have missed some clues. Having worked creatively to keep her twenty-year marriage to Leo fresh and exciting, she is completely caught off guard when he tells her he needs to go on a &quot;sabbatical&quot; from their life together, leaving Julie and their three children -- Gabe, Caroline, and Aury -- behind. But it soon becomes clear that his leave of absence is meant to be permanent. The succeeding months are filled with a confusion and sadness that shake the core of the entire family. Things take a turn for the worse when Julie is diagnosed with a serious illness and the children undertake a dangerous journey to find Leo -- before it&#39;s too late. As the known world sinksprecariously from view, the clan must navigate its way through the shoals of love, guilt, and betrayal. Together, with the help of Leo&#39;s parents and Julie&#39;s best friend, Cathy, they work their way back to solid ground and a new definition of family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one illuminates modern love, marriage, and parenting better than Jacquelyn Mitchard. Written with her trademark poignancy, humor, and insight, &lt;em&gt;The Breakdown Lane&lt;/em&gt; is her most moving, eloquent,and life-affirming work yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
