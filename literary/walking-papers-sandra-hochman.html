  <title>Walking Papers - Sandra Hochman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turner Publishing is proud to present a new edition of Sandra Hochman&#39;s first novel, &lt;i&gt;Walking Papers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First published by Viking Press in 1971, Hochman&#39;s widely-praised novel is about a messy divorce told with a poet&#39;s verve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Viking Press edition: Diana Balooka: “Out of my womanhood is my madness woven.&quot; And, for Diana, out of marriage has divorce arisen. With four children, a pet Zulu-Terrier (a rare breed), and a wheeler-dealer love affair to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana Balooka: &quot;We are babies. Watched by our elders. Like the dangerously Insane and deaf we invent our own language We gesture in our own mudras. We understand each other.&quot; Breaking into herself, Diana is a sanity robber armed with cupfuls of tears and lots of laughs. How can pain be amusing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Hochman&#39;s novel is how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a madcap erotic journal of the very separate parts of one woman&#39;s life. It is played out with a great personal intensity, a kind of tape-recorded reality that stuns and amazes upon the sound of her own voice; fast forward to Juarez. Mexico; reverse to her flamboyant grandfather&#39;s used stageprop farm, or to life In Paris with a hypnotist; hold, for a moment of tormented reflection, on Jason, the nonhusband; then slowly spin forward again, frantic and funny, turn, turn, to everything there is a season . . . . Should the tape chance to break. she bends and splices it together, twists it and sets it to reel on a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss Hochman pulls and tugs her heroine—a mother, tapdancer. writer, and partner in an affair that stretches from an ocean beach to real estate on Seventy- second Street—as she is caught to a bizarre parade of men on the hunt in New York City. Her invention, sensuality, and poetic gifts lend to &lt;i&gt;Walking Papers&lt;/i&gt; a totally original novelist&#39;s voice belonging, in Diana&#39;s words, to &quot;a woman obsessed with essentials.&quot; A women to be read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
