  <title>Breaking Away (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their first meeting was disastrous. Harriet Smith had accused the disreputable-looking, near-naked man of being a rapist. She&#39;d refused his plea for help. So it was highly embarrassing when Harriet discovered that the man was Rigg Matthews, her eminently respectable next-door neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rigg appeared ready to forgive and forget, especially when Harriet forged a firm friendship with his young niece. But then disaster struck again – Harriet made the mistake of falling in love with him…&lt;/p&gt;
