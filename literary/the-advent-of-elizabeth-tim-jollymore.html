      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four years have passed since the murdered girl was buried.&lt;br /&gt; The classmate who confessed to the stabbing is doing time. Both&lt;br /&gt; families moved out of town. Case closed? Justice done? Not so fast.&lt;br /&gt; As they converge on their California high school&amp;rsquo;s 100th anniversary&lt;br /&gt; celebration, cryptic notes are unsettling members of the &amp;ldquo;Class of&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lsquo;67&amp;rdquo;. Some question what they thought they knew.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Could a confused Doug Brandling have confessed to murder to cover&lt;br /&gt; for someone? Does his accuser, Elizabeth, really think she got it right?&lt;br /&gt; Is Finn, her lover of the time, certain he&amp;rsquo;s done with Liz? Can old Snub&lt;br /&gt; Randall, teacher of the year, keep his hands off his student-conquest?&lt;br /&gt; Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Monsignor Phelan be able to keep his alterboys straight?&lt;br /&gt; Might Farley Pike, the lip flapping sissified-teacher, survive the&lt;br /&gt; advent of Elizabeth?
