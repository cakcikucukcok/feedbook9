  <title>The Boss&#39;s Special Delivery (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Boardroom Brides, Book 3) - Raye Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;Six months pregnant and alone, Annie Torres had stopped believing in any white knights racing to save her.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, when she fainted from exhaustion, the very last thing she expected was to land in the arms of one of the most handsome men she&#39;d ever met - Dr. Matt Allman! Or that her bighearted rescuer would offer her a cushy job as his assistant and insist that Annie move into his family&#39;s mansion!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With all the attention Matt was giving her, this independent woman didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d manage on her own. Because her boss-in-shining-armor had suddenly become the answer to the dreams she&#39;d long denied!&lt;/p&gt;
