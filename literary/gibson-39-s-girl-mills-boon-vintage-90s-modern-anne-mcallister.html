          &lt;strong&gt;An innocent seduction? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gibson Walker was appalled when Chloe Madsen came to work for him. He&#39;d only agreed to employ her as a favor - he had no time to baby-sit an innocent small-town girl. So why was he finding himself tormented by Chloe&#39;s shy beauty - and infuriated that she didn&#39;t even notice him? Chloe didn&#39;t dare notice Gib. She was already engaged, and only in New York for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Besides, Gibson Walker was exactly the sort of man mothers warn their daughters about: sinfully gorgeous and determinedly single! Seduce her? Gib was tempted. Resist him? Chloe had to! But when fate threw them together it soon became a question of who was seducing whom… .&lt;/p&gt;
