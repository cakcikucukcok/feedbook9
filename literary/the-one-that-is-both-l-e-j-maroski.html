  <title>The One That Is Both - L. E. J. Maroski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jerry Fowss was ten years old, he had a paranormal experience that both alienated him from his family and ignited a search to understand what happened. However, neither Western science nor Eastern mysticism adequately explains his experience, so Jerry abandons his quest.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But the quest doesn&#39;t give up on him. An enigmatic urban shaman rekindles his inner fire, which then blazes higher when he meets Helen Donellyn, a journalist whose work takes them on an adventure into the frontiers of physics. Shortly after the shaman returns, Jerry mysteriously disappears.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Helen frantically searches for answers in her reality while Jerry lives those answers in an alternate reality where things happen by thinking them and dualisms are integrated by an advanced language. This world challenges his assumptions and deeply transforms him. Jerry&#39;s quest is universal-to find wholeness and connection in oneself and with others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The One That Is Both&lt;/I&gt; is ambitious, highly imaginative, thought-provoking, and original. Though the book is deeply probing, it is written with a light, refreshing flair.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
