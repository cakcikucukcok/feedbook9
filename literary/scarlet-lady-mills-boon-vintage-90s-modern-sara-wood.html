  <title>Scarlet Lady (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Sara Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Hon. Leo and his Scarlet Lady! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ginny loved her modeling career, just as she had always loved Leo Brandon. But a lost libel case bringing the Brandon name into disrepute meant the last straw for her marriage. Leo wanted a divorce. Two years later an ad asking Ginny to contact a man who could be her real father drew her to Saint Lucia.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was a timely moment for a woman in love. Not least of all because Leo had followed her. His pretend reason: to prevent Ginny dishonoring his precious family name again through any association with the infamous St. Honore. His real reason: to love, protect and remarry the woman he had once let go.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Three women are looking for their family - what they truly seek is love. Things are rarely as they seem in Sara Wood&#39;s intriguing family trilogy.&lt;/em&gt;
