  <title>Set This House in Order - Matt Ruff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andy Gage was born in 1965 and murdered not long after by his stepfather. . . . It was no ordinary murder. Though the torture and abuse that killed him were real, Andy Gage&#39;s death wasn&#39;t. Only his soul actually died, and when it died, it broke in pieces. Then the pieces became souls in their own right, coinheritors of Andy Gage&#39;s life. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Andy deals with the outside world, more than a hundred other souls share an imaginary house inside Andy&#39;s head, struggling to maintain an orderly coexistence: Aaron, the father figure; Adam, the mischievous teenager; Jake, the frightened little boy; Aunt Sam, the artist; Seferis, the defender; and Gideon, who wants to get rid of Andy and the others and run things on his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy&#39;s new coworker, Penny Driver, is also a multiple personality, a fact that Penny is only partially aware of. When several of Penny&#39;s other souls ask Andy for help, Andy reluctantly agrees, setting in motion a chain of events that threatens to destroy the stability of the house. Now Andy and Penny must work together to uncover a terrible secret that Andy has been keeping . . . from himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
