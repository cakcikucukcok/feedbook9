  <title>The Winged Histories - Sofia Samatar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Four women &amp;#151; a soldier, a scholar, a poet, and a socialite &amp;#151; are caught up on opposing sides of a violent rebellion. As war erupts and their loyalties and agendas and ideologies come into conflict, the four fear their lives may pass unrecorded. Using the sword and the pen, the body and the voice, they struggle not just to survive, but to make history.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here is the much-anticipated companion novel to Sofia Samatar&amp;#8217;s World Fantasy Award-winning debut, &lt;I&gt;A Stranger in Olondria. The Winged Histories&lt;/I&gt; is the saga of an empire &amp;#151; and a family: their friendships, their enduring love, their arcane and deadly secrets. Samatar asks who makes history, who endures it, and how the turbulence of historical change sweeps over every aspect of a life and over everyone, no matter whether or not they choose to seek it out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sofia Samatar&lt;/B&gt; is the author of the Crawford, British Fantasy, and World Fantasy award-winning novel &lt;I&gt;A Stranger in Olondria&lt;/I&gt;.
