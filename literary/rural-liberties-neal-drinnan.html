  <title>Rural Liberties - Neal Drinnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Moralla, a fading seaside town on the ‘beautifully uncivilised’ Sapphire Coast of New South Wales, has won Australia’s Tidy Towns award for two years running. Now Rebecca Moore—the most beautiful, talented girl in town—is dead and there’s nothing tidy about it. It seems everyone in this sleepy hollow is breaking bad and something has to be done. Why was she on the Princes Highway at four a.m.? What could have lured her there and how will the town cope with the series of events set in motion by her shocking departure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the maverick foundation Rural Liberties sets up unconventional sexual retreats on Moralla’s fringes and TV’s longest-running reality show recruits the town’s number two beauty, the stage is set for one of the most diabolical and outrageous coups ever. If what happens in Moralla stays in Moralla, then what will the new arrivals bring and what will they leave behind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is watching from the wings as the town’s moral compass goes haywire and a bold new era of debauchery and enlightenment is set to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
