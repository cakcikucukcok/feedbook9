  <title>The Heir - Henry Luk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this thrilling sequel to Henry Luk&#39;s acclaimed &lt;i&gt;China Bride&lt;/i&gt;, an all-American woman gets caught up in a deadly struggle to preserve her Chinese husband&#39;s ancient family empire amidst clashes of mores and customs, both business and private.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth O&#39;Connor, former US Olympic runner, came to Hong Kong the wife of the heir apparent to the Chang family empire . . . only to encounter deep-seated disapproval as a foreign bride. Hated in a culture where the patriarch&#39;s opinion is revered by all, Beth stands alone in a city where power is everything, and the struggle to maintain status is based on appearance and strength. Fortunately, she has both in spades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Chang Empire is crumbling and the patriarch has suffered a stroke. Partially disabled, he needs a steady hand to guide the family empire through the Asian Financial Crisis. He finds himself turning more frequently to Beth, whose determination and drive are better suited to fending off the looming disaster than her husband&#39;s impulsiveness. As her husband, eyeing the family throne, becomes more and more reckless, he leaves Beth alone to attempt to hold the family and the empire together in a world that would have no qualms betraying her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
