  <title>Trial Courtship (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Laura Abbot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It isn&#39;t easy being a kid.&lt;/strong&gt; Life&#39;s a trial for nine-year-old Nick Porter. His grandfather wants him to be good at sports, but he&#39;s hopeless. His grandmother wants him to eat vegetables, but he hates them. His aunt Andrea–who&#39;s his guardian–is nice, but she&#39;s always on him about school and manners and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It isn&#39;t easy being an adult.&lt;/strong&gt; Tony&#39;s worked hard to escape his past, and that means business always has to come first. So he&#39;s less than happy when he&#39;s called for jury duty during crucial merger negotiations. Then he meets Andrea Evans and starts to think it might be time to put pleasure before business….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It isn&#39;t easy being a family.&lt;/strong&gt; If Tony&#39;s going to have a chance with Andrea, he&#39;ll have to win over her nephew. And something tells him Nick will be a formidable opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
