  <title>Rebel Soldier - Solomon Mwapangidza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lizzys twin, Lucy, had committed suicide because they would not let her marry the man of her choice, and her aunt dies single, frustrated and bitter because they killed her fianc. Lizzy vows to fight for justice in a highly oppressive, male-dominated society. In solidarity with the two women she had loved, she swears never to get married nor fall in love. By pledging thus, however, the freedom fighter might have opened a front too many, for almost inevitably, she is caught in the snare of her own beliefs and principles. What happens to a yearning repressed, a yearning sacrificed to principle and loyalty? Does it merely vanish like a dream? 
Rebel Soldier takes you through a long, twisting, often tumultuous psychological journey of a strong-willed, rebellious, but also romantic woman who struggles to balance social obligations with emotional needs." />
