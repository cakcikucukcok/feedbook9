  <title>Little Constructions - Anna Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The darkly comic second novel from the author of the Man Booker Prize winner &lt;i&gt;Milkman&lt;/i&gt;, now available in the United States&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the small town of Tiptoe Floorboard, the Doe clan, a close-knit family of criminals and victims, has the run of the place. Yet there are signs that patriarch John Doe&#39;s reign may be coming to an end. When Jetty Doe breaks into a gun store and makes off with a Kalashnikov, the stage is set for a violent confrontation. But while Jetty is making her way across town in a taxi, an elusive, chatty narrator takes us on a wild journey, zooming in and out on various members of the Doe clan with long, digressive riffs that chase down the causes and repercussions of Jetty&#39;s act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before &lt;i&gt;Milkman&lt;/i&gt; took the world by storm after winning the Man Booker Prize, Anna Burns had already honed her distinctive voice. In her second novel, &lt;i&gt;Little Constructions&lt;/i&gt;, she exhibits the same linguistic brio, coruscating wit, and scintillating insight into men, women, and the roots of violence. A wickedly funny novel that swoops and spirals as it examines the long shadow of abuse and violent crime, &lt;i&gt;Little Constructions&lt;/i&gt; explores what transpires when unspeakable realities, long hidden from view, can no longer be denied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
