  <title>Sweetgirl - Travis Mulhauser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the heart, daring, and evocative atmosphere of &lt;em&gt;Winter&amp;#8217;s Bone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt;, and driven by the raw, whip-smart voice of Percy James, a blistering debut about a fearless sixteen-year old girl whose search for her missing mother leads to an unexpected discovery, and a life or death struggle in the harsh frozen landscape of the Upper Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a blizzard bears down, Percy James sets off to find her troubled mother, Carletta. For years, Percy has had to take care of herself and Mama&amp;#8212;a woman who&amp;#8217;s been unraveling for as long as her daughter can remember. Fearing Carletta is strung out on meth and that she won&amp;#8217;t survive the storm, Percy heads for Shelton Potter&amp;#8217;s cabin, deep in the woods of Northern Michigan. A two-bit criminal, as incompetent as he his violent, Shelton has been smoking his own cook and grieving the death of his beloved Labrador, Old Bo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Percy arrives, there is no sign of Carletta. Searching the house, she finds Shelton and his girlfriend drugged into oblivion&amp;#8212;and a crying baby girl left alone in a freezing room upstairs. From the moment the baby wraps a tiny hand around her finger, Percy knows she must save her&amp;#8212;a split-second decision that is the beginning of a dangerous odyssey in which she must battle the elements and evade Shelton and a small band of desperate criminals, hell-bent on getting that baby back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing she and the child cannot make it alone, Percy seeks help from Carletta&amp;#8217;s ex, Portis Dale, who is the closest thing she&amp;#8217;s ever had to a father. As the storm breaks and violence erupts, Percy will be forced to confront the haunting nature of her mother&amp;#8217;s affliction and finds her own fate tied more and more inextricably to the baby she is determined to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with the sweeping sense of cultural and geographic isolation of its setting&amp;#8212;the hills of fictional Cutler County in northern Michigan&amp;#8212;and told in Percy&amp;#8217;s unflinching style, &lt;em&gt;Sweetgirl&lt;/em&gt; is an affecting exploration of courage, sacrifice, and the ties that bind&amp;#8212;a taut and darkly humorous tour-de-force that is horrifying, tender, and hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
