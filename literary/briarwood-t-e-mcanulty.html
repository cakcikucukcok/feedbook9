  <title>Briarwood - T.E. McAnulty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do you fight what you cant put your finger on? This is Monica OReillys dilemmathe sort of prejudice that floats below the surface and feeds on insinuation and intolerance.
It is 1990. Monica is a shy, unassuming probationary teacher in a French immersion school with one year left before receiving tenure. She works hard, minds her own business, and does her best to avoid school politics. But with the arrival of a new principalthink the Devil Wears Pradaher life is suddenly turned upside down.
Although she has received glowing reports for her teaching, she now finds herself coming up short on all her evaluations. Not even a school break-in, a dead body, or an escaped reptile can distract her administrator from pursuing her insidious plan. Just when Monica is about to give up, her principal has a bizarre accident and is replaced by an administrator who doesnt share her toxic prejudices. When her principal recovers, shes like a new womanor is she?
This is not just a novel about a dysfunctional school system. Its about courage and perseverance in the face of sanctioned, institutionalized bullying. Ultimately, its a story about friendship, love, and the relationships that define us." />
