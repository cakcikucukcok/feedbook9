  <title>Rowing In Eden - Elizabeth Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pynch Lake is quiet nine months of the year but bursts into life each summer when the vacationers arrive. In the summer of 1965, year-round residents Harold and Peg Wahl find the world that once belonged to them is now being taken over by their older daughters, returned from college for the summer. Cool and self-possessed Rosamund is receiving the attention of the family friend who formerly courted Peg. Martie is filling the house with parties and houseguests of her own. No one in the family is paying much attention to the precocious thirteen-year-old Franny, who sets out to find a life of her own and, in the process, turns the Wahl family upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rich and lyrical language, Elizabeth Evans, author of the critically acclaimed novels &lt;em&gt;Carter Clay&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Blue Hour,&lt;/em&gt; has created both a profound meditation and a haunting story about the promises and betrayals of love. And in Franny Wahl, Evans has created one of the most memorable and endearing characters in recent fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
