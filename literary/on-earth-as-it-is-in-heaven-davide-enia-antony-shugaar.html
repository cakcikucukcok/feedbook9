  <title>On Earth as It Is in Heaven - Davide Enia, Antony Shugaar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dark, gripping coming-of-age tale that explores violence, friendship, family, and what it means to be a man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summer, Palermo, early 1980s. The air hangs hot and heavy. The Mafia-ruled city is a powder keg ready to ignite. In a boxing gym, a fatherless nine-year-old boy climbs into the ring to face his first opponent.&lt;br&gt;So begins &lt;i&gt;On Earth as It Is in Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, a sweeping multigenerational saga that reaches back to the collapse of the Italian front in North Africa and forward to young Davidù&#39;s quest to become Italy&#39;s national boxing champion, a feat that has eluded the other men of his family.&lt;br&gt;But Davide Enia, whose layered, lyrical, nonchronological novel caused a sensation when it was published in Italy in 2012, has crafted an epic that soars in miniature as well. The brutal struggles for dominance among Davidù&#39;s all male circle of friends; his strict but devoted grandmother, whose literacy is a badge of honor; his charismatic and manipulative great-uncle, who will become his trainer--the vicious scenes and sometimes unsympathetic characters Enia sketches land hard and true.&lt;i&gt;On Earth as It Is in Heaven &lt;/i&gt;is both firmly grounded in what Leonardo Sciascia liked to call &quot;Sicilitude&quot; - the language and mentality of that eternally perplexing island - and devastatingly universal. A meditation on physical violence, love and sex, friendship and betrayal, boxing and ambition, Enia&#39;s novel is also a coming-of-age tale that speaks - sometimes crudely, but always honestly - about the joys and terrors of becoming a man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
