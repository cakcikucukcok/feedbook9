  <title>Betrayed Again - David Givens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sherrice Valdez - a.k.a. The Queen Bee - is back, and this time she&#39;s the one running things. The money, power and fame are all hers for the taking. All her good fortune isn&#39;t without its setbacks, howevers. In the male dominated world of the drug trade she still has to prove her worth and navigate through all the beef and naysayers. On top of the new anti-gang task force headed by the obsessed Detective Williams always lurking on her heels, Sherrice runs afoul of a powerful drug lord named Rico Reed, and the men within her own crew, the GMC, resent the fact that she is in charge and are determined to see her falter. With her hulking psychopathic enforcer, Big Mo, at her side, she tries to balance her professional career with her illegal one. But when her dead fiance&#39;s brother shows up seeking answers into his brother&#39;s suspicious death, old feelings and secrets threaten to overcome her as she struggles to keep her head above the water. Sherrice receives a taste of her own medicine when someone in the shadows seeks to uncover her dark secrets and bring them to light. Can she stay alive and out of jail long enough to find out who is trying to bring her down? Or in the end will someone be Betrayed Again?" />
