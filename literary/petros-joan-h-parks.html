  <title>Petros - Joan H. Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the great destruction which obliterated the palace cultures of Minos, Ugarit, and many cities along the Mediterranean coast, the trade routes that connected the late Bronze age cities were disrupted.  
Part 3 continues the stories of the descendents of Thutmose, the founding Egyptian artist. Little Petros grows into a man who loves adventures and the life of traveling. He comes upon the nomadic Bedouin and their cherished war-mares and loses his heart to them. He cannot live with them for he owes duty to his kin. 
He and his brothers are sent to Egypt to purchase gems, gold and linen and discover if the old trade routes remain. They come upon an Arabian war-mare, and her companions; a girl disguised as a boy and a man who might be her father who are also on their way to Egypt.  Nothing is as it appears, and surrounded by old animosities, old grudges, and old feuds, the three brothers barely escape Egypt with their lives. They are pursued to their new home by distant kin and old grudges.
Petros grows into his manhood, discovers in himself the ability to innovate in an uncertain and changing world, forges new friendships and embarks on a tender love story." />
