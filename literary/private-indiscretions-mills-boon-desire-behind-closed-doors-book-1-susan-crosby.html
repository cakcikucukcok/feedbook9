  <title>Private Indiscretions (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) (Behind Closed Doors, Book 1) - Susan Crosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Forced by her very public persona to control her emotions, Dana Sterling found herself at a loss when she came face-to-face with Sam Remington. After more than a decade apart, he was suddenly back in her life, her only chance at avoiding a career-ending scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But why was Sam so intent on helping her? Was it the memory of the long-ago lust they had once shared, or was there more to his agenda?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Privately, Dana feared this grown-up, gorgeous Sam might destroy all that she had achieved–to make her pay for what they&#39;d both been denied. But if she allowed herself to succumb to the potent passions that still brewed between them…would she even care?&lt;/p&gt;
