          &lt;strong&gt;Have you heard the latest? Don&#39;t tell anyone but… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The groom was having an affair - with his bride&#39;s best friend! Jane had been desperate to stop the wedding. She&#39;d had to prevent her best friend from making the biggest mistake of her life… . Marrying Ryan Blair would have been disastrous. He was too rich, too powerful, too hot to handle!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was only one solution: to stand up in church and declare that she, Jane Sherwood, respectable businesswoman, was having a secret torrid affair with Ryan! It had worked. The wedding was finished. But now Ryan was determined to make Jane pay for his wrecked marriage - by making her his mistress for real!&lt;/p&gt;
