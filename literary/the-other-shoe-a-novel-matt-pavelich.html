  <title>The Other Shoe: A Novel - Matt Pavelich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Henry Brusett is the only one who can explain the mysterious death of Calvin Teague. He&amp;#8217;s the only one who truly knows how the young man came to be bloodied and lifeless on his land in Montana&amp;#8217;s vast backcountry. But Henry won&amp;#8217;t say anything. His silence and its ripple across his small community form the heart of Matt Pavelich&amp;#8217;s engrossing second novel, &lt;I&gt;The Other Shoe&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Henry never wanted much more than a family and his days spent as a sawyer deep in the wilderness. But by middle-age Henry is divorced, disabled, and isolated on a remote plot of land in Montana. After years of self-imposed loneliness, Henry meets Karen, who&amp;#8217;s half his age and knows nothing but her own willful solitude. Their union is the unlikeliest of bonds, a mix of comfort and guilt for Henry who believes he&amp;#8217;s too old for Karen. But it&amp;#8217;s also the spark of his undoing, a decision that leads him toward one of his greatest regrets.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As members of Henry and Karen&amp;#8217;s small town try to both uncover and cover-up the truth surrounding Calvin Teague&amp;#8217;s untimely death, &lt;I&gt;The Other Shoe&lt;/I&gt; moves toward the inescapable and shines in the rarity of Pavelich&amp;#8217;s assured and haunting style.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
