      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HAVISHAM&lt;/i&gt; IS THE ASTONISHING PRELUDE TO CHARLES DICKENS&#39;S &lt;i&gt;GREAT EXPECTATIONS&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she became the immortal and haunting Miss Havisham of &lt;i&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/i&gt;, she was Catherine, a young woman with all of her dreams ahead of her. Spry, imperious, she is the daughter of a wealthy brewer. But she is never far from the smell of hops and the arresting letters on the brewhouse wall--HAVISHAM--a reminder of all she owes to the family name and the family business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sent by her father to stay with the Chadwycks, Catherine discovers elegant pastimes to remove the taint of her family&#39;s new money. But for all her growing sophistication, Catherine is anything but worldly, and when a charismatic stranger pays her attention, everything--her heart, her future, the very Havisham name--is vulnerable.&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Havisham&lt;/i&gt;, Ronald Frame unfurls the psychological trauma that made young Catherine into Miss Havisham and cursed her to a life alone, roaming the halls of the mansion in the tatters of the dress she wore for the wedding she was never to have. &lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;Best Fiction Book of 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
