  <title>Seduction by the Book (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) (The Gypsy Inheritance, Book 1) - Linda Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The hurricane that imprisoned them…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;alone…in his island fortress was nothing compared to the storm raging within him. For two years, Nicholas Scoville had forbidden himself the pleasure of a woman, a self-imposed sentence that Annie Riley challenged with her healing hands and her infectious humor. When the lights went out, Nicholas took what he wanted, what he needed, what Annie offered.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And learned he was her first.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Annie deserved far better than him. She deserved Prince Charming, not some beast who&#39;d taken her innocence after she repaired his broken body. A man with the means to give her everything but what really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then he learned about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
