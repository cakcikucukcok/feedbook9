  <title>My Father&#39;s Wives - Mike Greenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The co-host of ESPN&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Mike and Mike&lt;/em&gt; follows up his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;All You Could Ask For&lt;/em&gt; with this poignant story of one man&amp;#8217;s search to understand himself, his marriage, and his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Sweetwater has been blessed with money, a fulfilling career, great kids and Claire, his smart, gorgeous, sophisticated wife. But there is one thing Jonathan never had: a relationship with his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percival Sweetwater III has been absent from his son&amp;#8217;s life since Jonathan was nine years old. A five-term U.S. senator, now dead, Percy was beloved by presidents, his constituents, and women alike, especially the five women who married him after Jonathan&amp;#8217;s mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan hasn&amp;#8217;t thought about Percy or the hole he left in his life for years. Dedicated to Claire and his family, he&amp;#8217;s nothing like his serial monogamist father. But then Jonathan discovers evidence that everything in his marriage may not be as perfect as he thought. Hurt and uncertain what to do, he knows that the only way to move forward is to go back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this quest for understanding&amp;#8212;about himself, about manhood, about marriage&amp;#8212;Jonathan decides to track down his father&amp;#8217;s five ex-wives. His journey will take him from cosmopolitan cities to the mile-high mountains to a tropical island&amp;#8212;and ultimately back to confront the one thing Jonathan has that his father never did: home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
