  <title>Claire Voyant - Saralee Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Of course the future is a mystery. But the past? This is nuts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about ruin-your-day flights. I&#39;m headed to Florida, when the elderly man seated next to me collapses on my tray table. I swear, if I&#39;d known this was his final boarding call, I would have offered him my pretzels or my &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. But no, I was too busy feeling bloated, anxious, depressed, unloved, a failure, and did I mention bloated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;d be bummed too if you were almost thirty, living back home in Plainview, Long Island, with your at-war parents and loser siblings. If your acting career was such a bust your last film was an X-ray. If your boyfriend and your agent dumped you the same week, but great news! -- They&#39;re in love with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could things possibly get any worse? Do you even need to ask?That man on the flight? We were related. And my life story? Nothing like I thought. Oh, and then this fall in the shower? Opened up my psychic senses. Bottom line? I knew nothing about my real past, but suddenly my future was coming in loud and clear!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve got to follow me on this amazing spiritual adventure that sent my life into a tailspin. I promise you love, laughter, oh-my-God secrets, and a ride to the &quot;other side&quot; you&#39;ll never forget. But lock the bathroom door. You&#39;re not coming out until you&#39;ve heard it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, Claire&lt;/p&gt;" />
