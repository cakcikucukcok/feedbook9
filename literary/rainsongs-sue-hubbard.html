  <title>Rainsongs - Sue Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Sue Hubbard, whose peerless and enduring voice combines the emotional intensity of John Banville and the lyrical evocation of Anne Enright, delivers inÂ RainsongsÂ an affecting story of transformation. Newly widowed, Martha Cassidy has returned  to a remote cottage in a nearly abandoned village on the west coast of Ireland.  There, she reflects on another loss in her life: that of her ten-year-old son,  Bruno, who met an untimely death twenty years earlier. Alone on the windswept  headland, surrounded by miles of cold sea, she feels the past closing in. As  the days unfold, Martha searches for a way forward beyond grief, but finds  herself drawn into a standoff between the successful hotel developer Eugene  Riordan and an elderly local hill farmer Paddy O&#39;Connell. As the crisis between  these men escalates and Paddy suspiciously ends up in the hospital, Martha  encounters Colm, a talented but much younger musician and poet--roughly the same  age that Bruno would have been if he&#39;d lived. Caught between her history and  future, and that of a rapidly changing Ireland, Martha is beset with choices that  will alter her life forever. Rainsongs conjures the rugged beauty of the remote Irish  coastline and the inner landscapes of its characters in richly poetic language,  moving effortlessly between the lives of people and the life of the terrain,  between the forces that shape character and those that shape the world. It  unfolds as a compelling tale of grief, art, and the fragile, quiet ways in  which time and place can offer a measure of redemption.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
