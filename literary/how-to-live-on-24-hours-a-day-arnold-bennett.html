      <meta name="description" content="You have to live on twenty-four hours of daily time. Out of it you have to spin health, pleasure, money, content, respect, and the evolution of your immortal soul. Its right use, its most effective use, is a matter of the highest urgency and of the most thrilling actuality. All depends on that. Your happiness - the elusive prize that you are all clutching for, my friends! - depends on that.&lt;br /&gt;

Which of us lives on twenty-four hours a day? And when I say &amp;quot;lives,&amp;quot; I do not mean exists, nor &amp;quot;muddles through.&amp;quot; Which of us is not saying to himself - which of us has not been saying to himself all his life: &amp;quot;I shall alter that when I have a little more time&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
