          &lt;strong&gt;Just married?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gillan Hart was one of Nerina Micallef&#39;s two favorite people in the world. The other was her big brother, Refalo. He was an overprotective, cynical millionaire. Gillan was a feisty, independent female. Nerina–a romantic. If only she could get her two favorite people together….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But, though Refalo was certainly not averse to the company of women, he preferred to make his own selection! Gillan was similarly unimpressed: in the few days she had known the sexy tycoon she&#39;d been insulted, accused and propositioned…. Now, it seemed, she was married!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nerina had had to resort to plan B–rumor! What better way to convince two people they belonged together than tell the world they were secretly wed?&lt;/p&gt;
