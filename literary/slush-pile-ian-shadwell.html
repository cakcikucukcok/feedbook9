      <meta name="description" content="Fourteen years ago Michael dazzled the world with Ephesus, a brilliant debut novel that won him the respect of his peers, plenty of easy sex and the coveted Booker Prize. Since then, there&#39;s been nothing but false starts and dead ends. He can&#39;t even finish a short story. With debt collectors at the door, the cellar empty and the mortgage on the line, it&#39;s crunch time. His wife, Tanya, issues an ultimatum: get a job or get a divorce. Forced into assessing his literary agent&#39;s slush pile to help make ends meet, Michael discovers a dark gem. He rewrites it to make it his own. His publisher loves it and fame beckons and his literary standing soars... until the real author appears.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slush Pile&lt;/i&gt; is a satire of literary ambition." />
