  <title>Single Mama Drama (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Kayla Perrin</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Twenty-eight-year-old Vanessa Cain had no idea that Eli, her husband-to-be, was already a married man.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or that he had a girlfriend on the side! Then, when Eli is killed by his mistress&#39;s husband, Vanessa&#39;s crazy world gets even more complicated. Now Eli&#39;s hostile widow, who happens to own the hip South Beach condo Vanessa and her young daughter shared with Eli, wants her out. Vanessa loves her home–it&#39;s the one stable thing in her life. But to keep it, she has to come up with money. Lots of it. Which means bringing in big business for her boss&#39;s motivational speaking agency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Chaz Andersen is big, the biggest name in life coaching and the hottest man alive. So with a business plan and a bikini, Vanessa heads down to the Bahamas to convince Chaz to sign with her–unaware that this single mama is about to get herself into a whole lot more drama.&lt;/p&gt;
