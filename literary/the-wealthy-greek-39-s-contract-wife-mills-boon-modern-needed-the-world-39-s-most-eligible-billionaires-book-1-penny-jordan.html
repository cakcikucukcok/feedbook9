            &lt;em&gt;In his hand was a contract to prove she owed him thousands… And she was penniless… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her last pennies in her pocket, Elizabeth Wareham arrived in Greece to fight for what was hers. But her adversary, Ilios Manos, was like a man carved from mythology. Ilios would take her body if he had to – he was in that kind of mood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the flicker behind her eyes belied an innocence he couldn’t ruin. So he’d take the next best thing – he was a man in need of a wife… He would show her mercy and she would take his name!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Needed: The World’s Most Eligible Billionaires Three penniless sisters, pure and proud…but about to be purchased!&lt;/p&gt;
