      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An out of sorts librarian finds support and friendship in the most unlikely place.&lt;/i&gt; The Order of Things&lt;i&gt; is a new novel from Lynne Hinton--the national bestselling author of&lt;/i&gt; Friendship Cake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreas Jay Hackett is a university librarian known for her love of keeping things organized. But one summer, she finds herself falling away from a sense of well being, depressed, &quot;out of order.&quot; Her work doesn&#39;t give her pleasure, her friends worry about her, and her own voice begins to frighten her. Therapy, pills and doctors visits don&#39;t help, so Andreas checks herself into a psychiatric facility. There, she finds herself in a room next door to a prison inmate who has also been hospitalized. As she talks with her new neighbor, Andreas begins to come out of her despair--ultimately finding the healing she needs through a friendship that develops in the darkest of circumstances, and despite boundaries of race, gender, education, and age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
