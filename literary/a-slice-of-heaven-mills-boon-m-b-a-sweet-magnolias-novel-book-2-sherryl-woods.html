  <title>A Slice Of Heaven (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (A Sweet Magnolias Novel, Book 2) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Dana Sue might run the best little restaurant in Serenity, but when you&#39;re feeding a small town of neighbors, busybodies and best friends, things can get a bit hot in the kitchen.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Never mind that she&#39;s putting on too many pounds (an occupational hazard for a chef)-she&#39;s worried about her too-skinny teenage daughter, Annie, who has been slowly starving herself since the loud, suitcase-tossing, name-calling fit on her front lawn that left Dana Sue minus one cheating husband.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But sometimes life picks strange ways to mend fences. When Annie lands in the hospital, Dana Sue reaches out to the man she loves to hate: Ron, the husband who took her heart when she tossed him out. Ron is still Annie&#39;s white knight, even if he&#39;s decidedly more tarnished in Dana Sue&#39;s eyes. But he still looks good enough to eat, and maybe, just maybe, to forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once, Ron made the mistake of letting go without a proper fight. But now Dana Sue is about to get another taste of sweet devotion from a man tired of feeling like a fool, hungry for that slice of heaven he found with her.&lt;/p&gt;
