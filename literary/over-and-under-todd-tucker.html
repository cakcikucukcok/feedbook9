  <title>Over and Under - Todd Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1979, Andy and Tom are two fourteen-year-old boys---best friends, expert cave explorers, and crack shots with their Springfield M-6 Scout rifles. In rural southern Indiana they are blissfully unaware of the local labor strife surrounding the Borden Casket Company. The fact that Andy&#39;s dad is a manager and Tom&#39;s dad is a union laborer has no bearing on their fun and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the building summer heat, violence quickly erupts---including an explosion, a murder, and the escape of two fugitives---and the young boys can no longer ignore that the world around them has forever changed. Through their secret observations of labor meetings, both boys feel the effect of the dissolution, and it tests their loyalty and friendship, as well as the town&#39;s spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a season of independence becomes a summer of growth and change, of adventure and misbehavior. Reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Stand by Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird, Over and Under&lt;/i&gt; is the quintessential story of ruddy-faced, scheming, precocious boys who must navigate that hazy boundary between growing up and making the most of their last summer of innocence and freedom as they explore the wilds of rural Indiana, see the most amazing gunshot of their lives, and discover what it means to be friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
