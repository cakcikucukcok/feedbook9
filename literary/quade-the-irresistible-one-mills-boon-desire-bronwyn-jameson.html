          &lt;strong&gt;A seemingly strong, independent woman, Chantal Goodwin had always had an unsuspected weakness, a secret hunger, for one breathtaking man - and now that man was back in town.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The merest glance from Cameron Quade still made her ache like the lovesick schoolgirl she&#39;d once been. But Chantal was a woman now, a woman who could take what she wanted - and what she wanted was a single shattering night of passion with this man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though their encounter shook her to the core, she told herself she could still watch him walk away forever. But that was before she learned about the new life their night of passion had created.&lt;/p&gt;
