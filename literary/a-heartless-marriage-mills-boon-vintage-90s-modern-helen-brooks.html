  <title>A Heartless Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Helen Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Marriage on trial!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From playboy lover… When gorgeous millionaire Raoul de Chevnair chose Leigh as his bride, it seemed he&#39;d left his flirtatious bachelor days behind for good. But had he? Their marriage had scarcely begun before his playboy habits returned and Leigh found him in the arms of another woman… . … to faithful husband?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was five years ago. Leigh is no longer a naive teenage, bowled over by Raoul&#39;s charm. So when he vows to win back her trust, Leigh is determined not to give in that easily! It&#39;s all very well for Raoul to sweep her off on an exotic second honeymoon, but Leigh needs a lot of convincing that Raoul has decided to take his marriage vows seriously after all!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Helen Brooks creates &quot;rich characters, sparkling interplay and a riveting emotional conflict.&quot; - &lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
