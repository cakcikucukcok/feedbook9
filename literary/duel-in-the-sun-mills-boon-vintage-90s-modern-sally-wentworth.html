  <title>Duel In The Sun (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Sally Wentworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Shall I describe the kind of man I think you would go for?&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t. He doesn&#39;t exist,&quot; Catriona said lightly. &quot;Not even in your imagination, in your dreams?&quot; Lucas Kane was a difficult man to work for. To say that he didn&#39;t suffer fools gladly was an understatement. And Catriona had wanted to get on one of Kane&#39;s famous archaeological adventures so badly that she&#39;d lied about her qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was her first mistake. Her second mistake was thinking that Lucas cared about anything except his work. She dreaded to think of the kind of job description Lucas Kane&#39;s wife would have. It would probably involve moving mountains and other such feats.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he wasn&#39; the only one who had high standards. The man of her dreams would be… well, unfortunately for Catriona, he&#39;d be Lucas Kane!&lt;/p&gt;
