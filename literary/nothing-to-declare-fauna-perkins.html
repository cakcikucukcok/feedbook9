  <title>Nothing to Declare - Fauna Perkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Nothing to Declare&lt;/i&gt; traces the story of Mila, a victim of the poverty of post-WWII Finland. Sold by her mother, sent alone across the world to a seemingly better life, she is adopted into a family ruled by a malevolent woman who makes Mila&#39;s growing-up years a living hell.&lt;p&gt;
The book alternates between Mila&#39;s life in America and her beloved brother&#39;s life in Finland where he fights a deadly disease. &lt;br&gt;An uplifting story of the bonds of family and hope. Forces the reader to keep turning the pages, searching for the next event.&lt;p&gt;
A life-sized painting. Layer by layer you discover darkness, a ray of light. The colors, the smells, the past and present, come to life. I feel powerfully connected to the little girl.  Her pain makes me weep, her spirit is strong. Marianne Friberg, Finnish artist:  hemp weaving, metal sculpture.&lt;p&gt;
A penetrating psychological portrait of the bond between brother and sister. Frightened, isolated, Mila fights fate&#39;s cruelty as her brother struggles for his life.  Their resolve, not only to endure life&#39;s hardships, but to transcend them, is remarkable and compelling. Fay E. Kagan, M.D., Child Psychiatrist, Los Angeles, CA&lt;p&gt;
Young people lived with the shadow of death during Finland&#39;s tuberculosis epidemic. Some found a way to live, and to love, in the midst of despair.  Powerful. Teems with life, determination, hope. Raimo A. Andersson, Finland&lt;p&gt;" />
