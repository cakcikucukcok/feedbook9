          &lt;strong&gt;Identical TWINS THE MYSTIQUE OF THE OLDER MAN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beautiful and barely twenty-four years old, Jackie Du Marcel had fallen in love with an older man. A tall, dark and experienced older man who wanted nothing to do with a young, inexperienced woman! And even her identical twin sister couldn&#39;t help her this time - Jackie was on her own. But how was she to win the heart of Ben Davis?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ben Davis was a no-nonsense businessman who knew better than to take what Jackie was offering. If she came by scantily clad, he&#39;d close his eyes! If she was sweet and understanding, he&#39;s stomp off! If she just jumped into the arms that were longing to wrap around her, he&#39;d… be absolutely unable to resist her…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;IDENTICAL TWINS!&lt;em&gt; This time the sisters can&#39;t switch places - love still comes their way!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
