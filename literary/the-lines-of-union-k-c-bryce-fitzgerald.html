  <title>The Lines of Union - K.C. Bryce FItzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States is on the brink of war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s August, 2026, and political unrest is sweeping the nation. &amp;nbsp;In the wake of a presidential assasination and the&lt;br /&gt; corporate takeover of Washington by banking giant Citi-Chase-Capitol-Morgan, the country has become deeply divided. &amp;nbsp;Republicans and Democrats wear party cards and fund campaigns with Red and Blue products (like toothpaste), while hardcore conservatives have joined the New Secession Coalition, which is calling to secede from the corrupt federal government. &amp;nbsp;It is a dark time for America.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, somewhere in the Mojave Desert, one voice has dared to stand up to corruption. &amp;nbsp;His name is John Herald, and his wildly popular internet talk show &amp;ldquo;The Herald&amp;rdquo; has become a rallying cry for progressive reformists&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; nation-wide. &amp;nbsp;Together with a motley crew of hacktivists, volunteers, and a crazy one-legged Iraq veteran named Harry &amp;ldquo;The Lieutenant&amp;rdquo; Harper, John leads a growing movement to fix the broken government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But John&amp;rsquo;s whole world changes the day he meets Christina Freidman, a beautiful enigma who unwittingly reunites him with his former-best-friend-turned-nemesis Alexander Avalon: the handsome heir to Citi-Chase-Capitol-Morgan. &amp;nbsp;Alex has returned to proclaim loyalty to John and his&amp;nbsp;movement...but there&amp;rsquo;s just one problem. &amp;nbsp;Alex is in love with Christina. &amp;nbsp;And so is John.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Torn between a man he doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust, the woman he loves, and the revolutionaries he inspired, John is forced to choose between friend, lover, and country. &amp;nbsp;The price? &amp;nbsp;One wrong choice could plunge America into its&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; second Civil War...&lt;/p&gt;" />
