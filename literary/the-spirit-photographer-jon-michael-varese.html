  <title>The Spirit Photographer - Jon Michael Varese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Boston, 1870.Â PhotographerÂ Edward Moody runs a booming  business capturing the images of theÂ spiritsÂ of the departed in his  portraits. He lures grieving widows and mourning mothers into his studio with  promises of catching the ghosts of their deceased loved ones with his camera.  Despite the whispers around town that Moody is a fraud of the basest kind, no  one has been able to expose him, and word of his gift has spread, earning him  money, fame, and a growing list of illustrious clients.  One day, while developing the negative  from a sitting to capture theÂ spiritÂ of the young son of an  abolitionist senator, Moody is shocked to see a different spectral figure  develop before his eyes. Instead of the staged image of the boy he was  expecting, the camera has seemingly captured theÂ spiritÂ of a  beautiful young woman. Is it possible that the  spiritÂ photographerÂ caught a real ghost? When Moody recognizes the  woman in the photograph as the daughter of an escaped slave he knew long ago,  he is compelled to travel from Boston to the Louisiana bayous to resolve their  unfinished business--and perhaps save his soul. But more than one person is out  to stop him . . .With dramatic twists and redolent of the  mood of the Southern Gothic,Â TheÂ SpiritÂ PhotographerÂ conjures  the Reconstruction era South, replete with fugitive hunters, voodoo healers,  and other dangers lurking in the swamp. Jon Michael Varese&#39;s deftly plotted  first novel is an intense tale of death and betrayalÂ that shows us how undeniably the ghosts of the past remain with us, and how resolutely they refuse to be quieted.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
