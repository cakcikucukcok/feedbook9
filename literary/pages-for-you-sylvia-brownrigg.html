  <title>Pages for You - Sylvia Brownrigg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wry, tender novel of sexual and intellectual awakening.  Something made her risk a look at the reader, who took a sip of black coffee. And another. She turned the pages. She pursed her lips. Flannery abandoned her breakfast and watched the woman drink her coffee. It wasn&#39;t that she wanted the coffee herself. That wasn&#39;t it. Rather, she wanted to be the coffee: she envied the dark drink its chance to taste those lips.In a steam-filled diner in a college town, Flannery Jansen catches sight of something more beautiful than she&#39;s ever seen: a graduate student, reading. Flannery, a seventeen-year-old, new to everything around her -- college, the East Coast, bodies of literature, and the sexual flurries of student life -- is shocked by her own desire to follow this beauty wherever it takes her. By chance she finds herself enrolled in a class taught by the remote, brilliant older woman; intimidated at first, she gradually becomes Anne Arden&#39;s student outside class as well. Whatever the subject -- Baudelaire, lipstick colors -- Flannery proves an eager pupil, until one day she learns more about Anne than she ever wanted to know.A bittersweet, exhilarating, sentimental education, Pages for You confirms Sylvia Brownrigg as &quot;one of the most exuberantly agile minds among younger American writers&quot; (Dan Cryer, &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;) and is her sexiest, most poignant work to date.&lt;/p&gt;" />
