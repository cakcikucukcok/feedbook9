  <title>The Contrarians - Gary Sernovitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bold and insightful novel detailing a young Wall Street analyst&#39;s fall from grace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Kelch is at the top of his game, one of Freshler Feld&#39;s rising stars. At only twenty-eight, he&#39;s one of the highest-rated equity research analysts in his sector; last year, he pulled down nearly half a million dollars. His personal life is also on a roll: his girlfriend, the comely Kersten Henry, couldn&#39;t be more supportive. Kelch&#39;s small-town, single-parent, Midwestern roots seem far behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a thinly veiled profile of Kelch runs in a prominent magazine, things start to go downhill. Not only does the piece reveal company secrets and cast Freshler Feld in a bad light, it also makes him feel like a dupe: the author tricked him into giving an interview. And it reveals far more about Kelch&#39;s conflicted feelings about his past and his job than he has admitted even to himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a stock Kelch handpicked falters, and things go from bad to worse as he is forced to examine just about every assumption, decision, and mistake he&#39;s ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With suspense and style, Gary Sernovitz&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Contrarians &lt;/i&gt;not only creates one of the most memorable &quot;money men&quot; in recent American fiction, it also examines, as no novel has done before, the rise-and the seeds of the fall-of late-nineties Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;" />
