  <title>Limbo - Melania G. Mazzucco, Virginia Jewiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A moving but unsentimental examination of one woman&#39;s life as she navigates life after war&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Christmas Eve and twenty-seven-year-old Manuela Paris is returning home to a seaside town outside Rome. Years ago, she left to become a soldier. Then, Manuela was fleeing an unhappy, rebellious adolescence; with anger, determination, and sacrifice she painstakingly built the life she dreamed of as a platoon commander in the Afghan desert. &lt;br&gt;     Now, she&#39;s fleeing something else entirely: the memory of a bloody attack that left her seriously injured. Her wounds have plunged her into in a very different and no less insidious war: against flashbacks, disillusionment, pain, and victimhood. &lt;br&gt;     Numb and adrift, she is startled to life by an encounter with a mysterious stranger, a man without a past who is, like her, suspended in his own private limbo of expectation and hope. Their relationship--confusing, invigorating--forces her to confront her past and the secrets she, and those closest to her, are hiding. &lt;br&gt;     In chapters that toggle between Manuela at home, grappling with her new life, and Manuela in Afghanistan, coming to terms with her role as a leader of fighting men and a peacemaker in a country that doesn&#39;t seem to want her help, Melania G. Mazzucco limns a story of love and loss, death and resistance in terms both surprising and cathartic. &lt;i&gt;Limbo&lt;/i&gt; asks its readers, no less than its protagonist, what it means to be a daughter, a sister, a woman, a citizen, a soldier--or, more simply, a human.&lt;/p&gt;" />
