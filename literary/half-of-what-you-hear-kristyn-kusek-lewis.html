  <title>Half of What You Hear - Kristyn Kusek Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From well-loved women&amp;#8217;s fiction writer Kristyn Kusek Lewis comes a breakout novel about a woman moving to a small community and uncovering the many secrets that hide behind closed doors&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of Liane Moriarty and Elin Hilderbrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greyhill, Virginia&amp;#8212;refuge of old money, old mansions, and old-fashioned ideas about who belongs and who doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8212;just got a few new residents. When Bess Warner arrives in town with her husband Cole and their kids, she thinks she knows what to expect. Sure, moving to Cole&amp;#8217;s small hometown means she&amp;#8217;ll have to live across the street from her mother-in-law, and yes, there&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot to learn as they take over Cole&amp;#8217;s family&amp;#8217;s inn-keeping business, but Bess believes it will be the perfect escape from Washington. She &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; it to be. After losing her White House job under a cloud of scandal, she hardly knows who she is anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bess quickly discovers that fitting in is easier said than done. Instead of the simpler life she&amp;#8217;d banked on, she finds herself preoccupied by barbed questions from gossipy locals and her own worries over how her twins are acclimating at the town&amp;#8217;s elite private school. When the opportunity to write an article for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s lifestyle supplement falls into Bess&amp;#8217;s lap, she thinks it might finally be her opportunity to find her footing here&amp;#8230;even if the subject of the piece is Greyhill&amp;#8217;s most notorious resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susannah &amp;#8220;Cricket&amp;#8221; Lane, fruit of the town&amp;#8217;s deepest-rooted family tree, is a special sort of outsider, having just returned to Greyhill from New York after a decades-long hiatus. The long absence has always been the subject of suspicion, not that the eccentric Susannah cares what anyone thinks; as a matter of fact, she seems bent on antagonizing as many people as possible. But is Susannah being sincere with Bess&amp;#8212;or is she using their strangely intense interview sessions for her to further an agenda that includes peeling back the layers of Greyhill&amp;#8217;s darkest secrets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bess discovers unsettling truths about Susannah and&amp;#160;Greyhill at large, ones that bring her into the secrets of prior generations, she begins to learn how difficult it is to start over in a town that runs on talk, and that sometimes, the best way to find yourself is to uncover what everyone around you is hiding....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
