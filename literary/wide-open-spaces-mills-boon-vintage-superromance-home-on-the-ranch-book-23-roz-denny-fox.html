          &lt;strong&gt;The Forked Lightning Ranch, near Callanton, Oregon&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summer Marsh wants to hang on to her family&#39;s cattle spread. It&#39;s the only life she knows…and it&#39;s her son&#39;s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summer&#39;s ex-husband, Frank, sees the ranch as a cash cow–literally. With the collusion of his new girlfriend, he&#39;s trying to sell it to a developer at an inflated price. Summer has to come up with almost four million dollars in order to buy Frank out. Impossible! She might be land rich but she&#39;s cash poor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s Coltrane Quinn. He&#39;s a broken-down soldier and one-time horse breeder, and like Summer, he was betrayed by his ex. Now he&#39;s working for the conservation group Save Open Spaces. He&#39;s hoping to buy the Forked Lightning on behalf of SOS, which acquires failing ranches in order to preserve the land.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Colt&#39;s operating in secrecy, so things get complicated when he falls for Summer. They get even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; complicated when she falls for him!&lt;/p&gt;
