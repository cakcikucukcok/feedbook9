  <title>You are Always Safe with Me - Merrill Joan Gerber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In this powerful love story that takes place on a Turkish sailing vessel, Lily, a professor at a Florida college, finds herself required to be the companion of her newly widowed mother as they take a cruise along the Turkish coastline on a small sailing ketch.  Expecting to endure, though not enjoy, this trip among her mother&amp;#8217;s friends, Lily instead finds herself falling in love with Izak, the charismatic Turkish captain of the boat, a man whose powers of kindness, strength and tenderness touch Lily in  a way that awaken longings in her she had given up long ago.  Lilly&amp;#8217;s infatuation with Izak surprises her and at first she resists her feelings, knowing that it would be nearly impossible for an American college professor and a Turkish sailor to find a meeting place to join their lives. However, one day while the others are on a trip away from the boat taking a tour to see the sights, Lily finds herself alone with Izak and their passion reveals itself.&lt;/div&gt;" />
