  <title>My Days - R. K. Narayan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I am inclined to call this the last chapter, but how can an autobiography have a final chapter? At best, it can only be a penultimate one; nor can it be given a rounded-off conclusion, as is possible in a work of fiction.&amp;#34; So begins the last chapter of &lt;em&gt;My Days&lt;/em&gt;, the only memoir from R. K. Narayan, hailed as &amp;#34;India&amp;#39;s most notable novelist and short-story writer&amp;#34; by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his usual winning, humorous style, R. K. Narayan shares his life story, beginning in his grandmother&amp;#39;s garden in Madras with his ferocious pet peacock. As a young boy with no interest in school, he trains grasshoppers, scouts, and generally takes part in life&amp;#39;s excitements. Against the advice of all, especially his commanding headmaster father, the dreaming Narayan takes to writing fiction, and one of his pieces is accepted by &lt;em&gt;Punch&lt;/em&gt; magazine (his &amp;#34;first prestige publication&amp;#34;). Soon his life includes bumbling British diplomats, curious movie moguls, evasive Indian officials, eccentric journalists, and &amp;#34;the blind urge&amp;#34; to fall in love. R. K. Narayan&amp;#39;s larger-than-life perception of the human comedy is at once acute and forgiving, and always true to it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
