          &lt;strong&gt;&quot; YOU HEARD ME. I&#39; LL BE YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND. ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raine Crockett stared at the handsome lawyer in disbelief. Just about everything was wrong with Neil Rankin coming down to the Sandbur ranch and posing as her fiancé, not the least of which was that his mere presence set her on fire. And he just had to make their romance realistic, right? A loving kiss, a protective arm around her shoulders. She could get used to his affections, but what would happen when their little ruse was over?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Oh, Raine, you are in way over your head and getting deeper by the minute!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;MEN OF THE WEST&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Whether ranchers or lawmen, these heartbreakers can ride, shoot–and drive a woman crazy…&lt;/strong&gt;
