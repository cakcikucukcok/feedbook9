        &lt;p&gt;Lori O&#39;Neill surprised herself when she kissed her late husband&#39;s brother. Maybe it was pregnancy hormones, but this mother-to-be was looking at Carson in a whole new light.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carson had been there for Lori ever since she&#39;d lost her husband, but, as her due date drew near, Lori suddenly wanted more than just a shoulder to lean on. She wanted to confess how special he was to her–and how his presence alone gave her goose bumps. She had one chance left to give her child the perfect father–but was Carson ready to be Lori&#39;s husband?&lt;/p&gt;
