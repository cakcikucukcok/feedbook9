  <title>Metaphysical Short Stories - R. Neville Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Been looking for a fun way to arrive at a higher consciousness? This is a book of Stories, Games and Dreams. Bonus: See a short story converted to a screen play! The tails within will transport you into a universe of pleasure, entertainment and a far greater personal power. Imagine yourself on an alien world, what would life be like in this truly foreign civilization. Who would your new friends be? How about a history lesson from a planet so ancient that its chronicles included the first &quot;freedom&quot; ever founded in all the universe. What about an entire solar system created as the home of one being? Find out what happens when the smartest kid in class suddenly discovers a society of people just like himself. Care to hear some confessions of a real past life therapist? There isn&#39;t another book like this one, it is education without effort. Ask this volume to tell you something interesting, something you don&#39;t already know, then open to any page . . . &quot;If it&#39;s not funny, it&#39;s not healed! (Page). This adventure in written word leaves one cultivated, enlightened and alive in a way that must be experienced to be understood. Mr. Johnston was shot to death in 1977, this started his new path. &quot;The human race is to become an advanced civilization, we are designed this way&quot; He began by writing a series called &quot;The language Codes&quot; His latest works have incorporated Story Telling to do the teaching. Everything he writes awakens people." />
