  <title>A Step Too Far - Daniel B. Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul Thorne is a violent man with a checkered past who has just obtained his dream job with one of the three most powerful corporations in human space. Working for a steady paycheck, under the protective umbrella of Syrch Corp, is an enormous opportunity that promises a bright future. But all that is jeopardized when Paul receives an unthinkable assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jillian Caldwell is the niece and ward of a biochemist on Papens World. Her mother hid sensitive information from Syrch Corp on Jillians cranial mesh, and now Jillian is a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul is propelled on a journey of murder, lies, and half-truths, his resolve is tested as he clashes with the corporation he hoped would be his salvation. Now as Jillians fate hangs precariously in the balance, Paul must decide whether he has what it takes to be an Enforcer or whether he should let his ethos lead him into an unknown future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this gripping science fiction tale, one man is pitted against a hulking intergalactic corporation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
