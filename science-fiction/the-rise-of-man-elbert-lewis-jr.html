  <title>The Rise of Man - Elbert Lewis Jr.</title>

At times they were unwanted, ridiculed and ostracized by society. Many were abandoned at birth and forced to endure rejection and scorn for a circumstance of birth they had no say in. Nearly all of them struggled with the anguish of not being fully accepted by any race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second decade of the 21st Century a twist of fate would change all of that and catapult them to the pinnacle of humanity where their heroism and sacrifice will become legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Logan, the first MAN, led the nuclear powers of Earth to a victory over the Hadaran expeditionary force he then set about preparing mankind for the return of the fierce aliens in far greater numbers. Only multi-race humans, those having the prerequisite diverse genetic make-up for enhancement to a super-human genome-adept by the Trans Cerebral Imprinter, will stand in the way of total domination and enslavement of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the integration of advanced alien technology and Earths preeminent scientific minds, Logan builds an army of genome-adepts, the most lethal fighting force in human history and leads them in a desperate battle for Earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
