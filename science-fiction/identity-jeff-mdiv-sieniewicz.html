      <meta name="description" content="Frank Dopler at twenty-four was on top of the world. That is until his wife Sarah and their young son Johnathon were ripped suddenly from his life.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now approaching forty, Frank has managed to rebuild what could only be called a sustainable life, with his good friend Laura the only true bright spot. But with his optimism about life diminished, Frank will soon learn that there is always more to life than there appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This lesson oddly will begin when Bruce the Belligerent, the leader of the planet Hiruaha, sends his robotic Etan agents to abduct Frank and bring him back to Hiruaha. Frank is set to stand trial for the theft of their beloved Beacon of Light, the worst crime imaginable to a Hiruahian.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But trying to escape from Hiruaha alive will only be the beginning of Frank&amp;#39;s adventure; ultimately he will have to make the biggest decision of his life. A decision that will have become more difficult than he could have ever imagined . . ." />
