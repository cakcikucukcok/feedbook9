      <meta name="description" content="There is something in the shadows... There, in the corner of the glass... Perhaps it&#39;s just an imperfection, the mirror is old and neglected... But you know that it&#39;s not an imperfection. There is something, there, moving with purpose. Something that wants something... And what might that something be There is something in the Bayeaux around New Orleans... Something tragic. Something evil. There is a reason why a man hardened in the school of the alley and the life-preserver cannot think of the heads in Blenheim Castle without shuddering, and a horrible reason for what some would call a dire revenge. There is an exhibit in a museum that, to a trained mind, radiates fear... betrayal... bewilderment. There is something moving in the darkness in the mirror." />
