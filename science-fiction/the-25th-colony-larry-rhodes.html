  <title>The 25Th Colony - Larry Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the near future, Earth becomes caught in the middle of an extraterrestrial turf war when the human species finds itself hopelessly entangled in a race between two alien speciesthe Octans and the Jubansto colonize the galaxy. 
At a time when Earths resources are stretched beyond their limits, the Octans, a seemingly benevolent species, offer Earth advanced technology to help resolve its food and energy crises if they will help in the colonization of distant planets. The Octans also promise to provide the colonists with their basic needs in order to thrive on their new home worldsfood, clothing and shelter.  Planning expert Mike Silver shocks his family and friends by joining a colony destined for the supposedly uninhabited planet Kepler 14b.  He steps up and is quickly elected city planneronly to find himself appointed mayor right before the colonists leave Earth.  
Unknown to either the Octans or the humans, a clandestine team of the competing alien speciesthe Jubansis sent to Earth to disrupt the formation of the human colonies. 
The new colonists quickly learn that their uninhabited home is anything but. Kepler is full of countless new and strange animals and several cave-dwelling tribes. The colonists struggle to adapt, but just as the colony appears successful, Mikes abilities are further tested. He must assume multiple roles as an Octan ambassador, justice, and even sheriff to help resolve problems that are threatening the very survival of the far-flung human colonies. 
When both the Octans and the Jubans lay claim to the same colony, Mike must step up his game like never before as he now represents Earth in negotiations to prevent a resumption of hostilities between the two alien species." />
