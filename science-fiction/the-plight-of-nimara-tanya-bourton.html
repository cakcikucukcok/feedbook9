      <meta name="description" content="Bruno is a typical fifteen-year-old boy who wants to be popular. He has a crush on a new girl named Summer, who mysteriously disappears from his life. 
One very ordinary day while on his way to school, he does not reach his destination. Instead, Bruno is forced into extraordinary circumstances that test his mental and physical strength. He experiences what no one has ever had to face before and has to make important decisions that, at times, are painful. It is not only his life that depends on this but the lives of a whole planet. 
With the help of a handful of trustworthy and faithful companions, he must face his fiercest battle-and win. It is his destiny to fight. 
Will he be victorious, or will fate deal him a losing hand?" />
