  <title>Reps and Royals - Amy Engle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Princess Juzeera&amp;rsquo;s twenty-first Birth Week celebration was meant to be the highlight event of the year. However, that all changes when two space visitors arrive on her planet to spoil her fun. Tired of their accusations that her home is a dangerous place where people disappear, The Princess finds ways of turning situations to her advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Newly-appointed as a Representative for the Space Colonization Guild, Tybrik strives to make his mark on the world. Ironically, his first task as mission leader is on an aptly named planet called &amp;quot;The World.&amp;quot; He is determined to prove that he has what it takes to be in command and live up to the Director&amp;rsquo;s expectations. Tybrik finds this difficult to do when he suddenly finds himself blackmailing The Princess in order to keep his identity a secret. This proves to be a fool-hardy scheme since the spaceman has now drawn the attention of Juzeera&amp;#39;s other suitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After barely arriving at The World in one piece, Haelon puts her guard up. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that her half-brother, Tybrik, has gotten himself mixed up in a pretend relationship with Princess Juzeera. While her incompetent sibling and the powder puff waste time convincing the Worldians that they are a couple, it is up to Haelon to take control of the mission and investigate the mysterious disappearances of the SCG Reps. All the while, a missing item from a past assignment has been sent to Haelon as a &amp;ldquo;gift.&amp;rdquo; The Representative must determine if she can trust her stalker or handle her situation on her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
