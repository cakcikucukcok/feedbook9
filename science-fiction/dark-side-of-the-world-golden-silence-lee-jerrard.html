Across the ocean, the new circular island of Pervil is congested with impressive towers and giant TV screens in every direction, but crime and terror wander the streets with a violent race of disfigured mutants.   As for one man, the greatest thing to ever happen to him was to fall in love and have a baby girl, but against his line of work it was also his biggest mistake. Forced to live an anonymous life in Pervil, he is entrapped, living on borrowed time and desperate to escape to the other side for the safety of his family.   When officially offered his chance to escape to the other side, he has no choice but to take on an operation far from his control. On a journey with a band of hopefuls he becomes tangled up in a war. Fighting to survive with the horrors that await him he must face his own conscience when he learns the awful truths outside of Pervil." />
