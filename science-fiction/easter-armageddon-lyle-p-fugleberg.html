  <title>Easter Armageddon - Lyle P. Fugleberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As John Anderson, an ardent outdoorsman and former Eagle Scout enters the woods on his way to his favorite fishing hole, he has no idea that he is about to be cast into an incredible primal world where the Earths ecology faces destruction.&lt;p&gt;
John is struggling with his own spirituality as he moves from troubled teen to manhood, searching for his calling. After becoming lost in the woods, John begins to notice subtle changes that cause him to wonder if he has accidentally wandered into a time warp where animals are abundant and the forest is dense. As John awaits a rescue that he realizes may never come, he relies on his Scout skills to survive. Just as he assumes hes all alone, he discovers a human footprint that leads him to Otzi, a small man from a period 5,000 years ago. Faced with challenges he does not yet understand, John eventually realizes hes on a mission to develop a culture for the primitive people he encounters along the way. &lt;p&gt;
Finally, a revelation of truth arrives in a maelstrom that confirms John is indeed on a mission to save the world from an ecological crisis, but will he pay the ultimate price in the end?" />
