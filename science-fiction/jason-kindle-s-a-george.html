  <title>Jason Kindle - S. A. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;2100AD: The pollution is level 10, a news report said. Tragic things were happening on planet Earth as global warming became worse and the wars for fuel were fought between the First Four planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Kindle, a teenager, began a journey as one of two-hundred passengers, across the Milky Way Galaxy in search of a new home world and a new beginning. He encounters the first of an alien life form who helped save his life and those of the other passengers and their ship called the Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new life on a new world called Bright Star had its problems. Establishing a new world order was begun immediately after arrival. Several hundred years had passed on Earth since the Galaxy departed two-hundred years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason was responsible for bringing cohesion between the human race and the Narin species. However, suspicions about the alien presence on Bright Star, persisted. His actions later result in a trip to Earth to face execution. He saw many exciting discoveries in space on that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M-13, a moon orbiting a dead planet, recently discovered, was about to give up its secrets and unravel a mystery about the human race and an earlier journey into deep space; a debris field was orbiting this small moon and could be seen more clearly as it passed in front of the sun. Was this a result of a cataclysmic end to a space journey&lt;/p&gt;" />
