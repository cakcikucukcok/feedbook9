  <title>It Happened in India - Francis A. Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story is set in India around the middle of the century. It projects a country which has become fully developed in all aspects of science and technology to the extent that it can enter the space race with fully fledged confidence, and its scientists can provide solutions to issues as diverse as the worlds energy crisis and the scourge of cancer. That these magnificent achievements come at a great price can be seen by the attempts by Indias enemies to thwart this progress and bring that countrys scientific endeavours to a grinding halt. The storys central character, Aparajeet Chopra, not only has to engage himself in a campaign to save his country, but also himself from a series of terminal diseases which his enemies, in some mysterious way, manage to inflict on him. While the story presents to its readers an image of a modern, scientific and technologically advanced India, the religious and cultural traditions which weave together the rich tapestry of what makes India the marvel and jewel that it most undoubtedly is, are brought out in full panoply for the reader to enjoy" />
