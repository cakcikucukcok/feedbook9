  <title>Betrayed (Book #3 in the Vampire Journals) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book to rival TWILIGHT and VAMPIRE DIARIES, and one that will have you wanting to keep reading until the very last page! If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com (Turned)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BETRAYED is book #3 in the #1 Bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS, which begins with TURNED (Book #1)! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BETRAYED (Book #3 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin Paine awakes from a deep coma to discover she has been turned. Now a true, full-bred vampire, she marvels at her new powers, including her ability to fly, and her superhuman strength. She finds that her true love, Caleb, is still by her side, waiting patiently for her to recover. She has everything she could dream of. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until it all, suddenly, goes terribly wrong. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin is horrified to discover Caleb with his ex-wife, Sera, and before Caleb has a chance to explain, Caitlin tells him to leave. Heartbroken, confused, Caitlin wants to curl up and die, her only consolation being in her wolf-pup Rose. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin also finds consolation in her new surroundings. She finds she has been placed on a hidden island in the Hudson River—Pollepel—amidst an elite coven of teenage vampires, boys and girls alike, 24 in all, including her. She learns that this is a place for outcasts, just like her, and as she meets her new best friend, Polly, and begins her training in elite vampire combat, she realizes that she might finally have a place to call home. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a major vampire war is looming, and her brother Sam is still out there, kidnapped by Samantha. The evil Kyle, too, now wielding the mythical Sword, is still on the warpath, and he will stop at nothing to wipe out New York. Caitlin, despite her new home, and despite her finding a new love interest in the elusive vampire Blake, knows that she can only stay on this island for so long before her destiny calls. After all, she is still the One, and all eyes still look to her to find her father and the other weapon that might save them all. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torn between her new friends and her lingering feelings for Caleb, she must come to decide where her true loyalties lie, and whether she is willing to risk it all to try to find Caleb and have him in her life once again…. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BETRAYED is a great installment for this series. If you haven&#39;t read her first two novels, read them and then get your hands on BETRAYED.” &lt;p&gt;VampireBookSite &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cliffhanger at the end of BETRAYED will leave the reader panting for more, and BETRAYED receives a solid A for its face paced read, and imaginative story.” &lt;p&gt;--The Dallas Examiner &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BETRAYED has good romance, a strong plot, lots of action, and a very quick pace. There are so many wonderful surprises that you will not want to stop reading it until the very end.” &lt;p&gt;--The Romance Reviews" />
