  <title>Songs for The Lost - Alexander Zelenyj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Horror, SCI-FI and Weird story collection, Speculative Fiction at its best.&lt;br /&gt;
First digital edition of the work, Cover Art by Giampaolo Frizzi.&lt;br /&gt;
The lonely and the regretful and the downtrodden, the furious and the woeful and the damaged; all facing the futility of living in a world of malice, loss and loneliness; all desperately seeking salvation while forging through the miles of pain marking every step of the path to Paradise . . .&lt;br /&gt;
A farmer sings a nightly funeral dirge, summoning something from far across the fields. A cavalry troop finds Heaven or Hell in the hills. A reporter witnesses the final inexplicable moments of a saucer suicide cult. A boy and his grandfather hear a message from an un-guessed world beneath their feet. A boxer faces his greatest nemesis during the strangest of storms. a platoon is faced with a terrible choice in the jungle. A garage band and their loyal fans disappear as part of the fulfillment of a prophecy. An outpost of Roman Legionnaires is terrorized by an ancient evil. Two alien children forge a unique pact with two Earth children. A strange door opens in the middle of a burning summer day. A seasoned detective interrogates a vengeful angel responsible for the haunting of an entire city. A bounty hunter accepts a mission to hunt another man&amp;#39;s demon. A husband and wife receive a long-awaited message from the sky. A broken girl is bestowed a gift from the moon. A group of troubled misfits search for Heaven in a violent future. A brother and sister await the greatest fire the world will ever see...&lt;br /&gt;
All these Songs For The Lost, and other ghosts, too...&lt;br /&gt;
This collection also contains an introduction by David Rix and a foreword by Brian A. Dixon." />
