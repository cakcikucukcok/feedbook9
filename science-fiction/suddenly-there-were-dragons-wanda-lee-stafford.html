  <title>Suddenly There Were Dragons - Wanda Lee Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There were refugees everywhere, from the race of man, from the Dwarven race, from the Elven race. Hawks eyes narrowed as his thoughts raced, he had seen so many burnt hamlets towns and cities, now even whole country&#39;s had fallen to these foes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though he now had more information about the enemy it did not seem to help, rather he thought just the opposite. Kaelin joined him, using hand signals the Elven prince conveyed certain messages to Hawk, the first thing he told him was that both of the men he had sent to the North and South had returned, at about the same time he had returned from the East. Hawk himself had taken the West.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He shook himself silently, he moved grasping Kaelins arm and hand he flashed back that he was about to leave to rejoin the others at the assigned area, there to meet and compare on what they were seeing, this way all four directions will have been checked.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Smoke drifting their way from the city, was making both of their eyes sting and burn both muffled their coughing as best they could. When he had arrived at this spot he had seen miles of prisoners in chains being marched to the South. Somehow he also understood that the other two men and the prince would all be reporting the same thing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Devastation burning and looting wherever the foe went, no one seemed able to fight these fell and evil things, again he wondered if the combined might of the Elven nation, the Dwarven nation and the remaining nations of men would be able to stop this unrelenting force, or would this truly be the end of the world as they knew it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
