  <title>Shattered Time - Stephen B. McAfee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if there were a way to change something in one&#39;s past? That one thing, everyone has in their life that they have dreamed of having the ability to change. If it were possible to go back in time and make those changes, what unknown truths might be discovered? What rewards could be achieved and at what cost? How would changing the past affect the present? Would learning the truth about the past be worth knowing?   Joe Adam&#39;s obsession was to do whatever he could to save the life of his father who was killed before Joe was born. If he were successful in saving his life, then his beloved brother, sister, and children would not exist. He would never have the wonderful family he has now. Traveling back in time maybe truth shattering, but as Joe discovers, is both devastating and rewarding.   This encounter holds secrets for all parties involved. In this story the mystery of time travel is unlocked, and Joe, as well as the reader, is in for quite an adventure." />
