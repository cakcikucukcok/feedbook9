  <title>The Ghost of Charity Alden - Henrik Moller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ghost of Charity Alden revolves around Charity Alden, a girl who drowned in 1796 at the age of sixteen, an event she hasn&#39;t quite gotten over despite the passage of a quarter of a millennium.  Mostly, she&#39;s content just to watch her little town of Lexington, Virginia, grow as the centuries pass.  But then, one night a couple hundred years after she died, Charity iencounters a real living, breathing, guy who can actually see her.  He can hear her.  In two hundred years, no other living soul had ever been able to do that.  And he&#39;s handsome, he&#39;s fun to be with, and Charity&#39;s been lonely for a long, long, time. He&#39;s not dead--yet--which is a bit inconvenient, but, well, what relationship doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s awkward little wrinkles?  But there are far, far, worse ways of dying than simply drowning.  Death so far gone in rage and grief that echoes of it, even centuries later, can kill.  And it&#39;s up to Charity and Eric to save Lexington from horrors from out of the past." />
