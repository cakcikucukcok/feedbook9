  <title>Prythvii: the Forgotten Heirs - Ali Hasanali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The boy remained silent as his uncle looked back down at him. The boy felt uncomfortable as he gazed into the green eyes of a man who had just been introduced as family. The uncles green eyes fell over the boys countenance and focused on the small gray statue that hung on a black string around the young boys neck. The statue was barely longer than an inch and had a mythical lizards tail ensnaring a deep red stone, as if the creature was protecting something sacred.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man with green eyes looked up and smiled slyly at the young boy. Ahh How could I forget? I am in the presence of the youngest Zilsrion heir?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be a dream, not a recollection. It was supposed to be just a necklace, not a secret gift of an ancient royal family. He was supposed to be Nasser Salim, not a man without an identity. That was before meeting the eldest Elder.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed and cursed by his Prythvii, Nasser must discover his purpose and understand his destiny if the man with the green eyes is ever to be stopped.&lt;/b&gt;" />
