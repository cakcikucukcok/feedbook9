  <title>Battlestar Galactica Trilogy - Peter David, Craig Shaw Gardner, Steven Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/i&gt;, recognized as one of the most provocative, and socially relevant series of the new millennium, earned its status as a classic American drama series after its very first, Peabody Award-winning season. Here, for the first time in one volume, are all three original &lt;i&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/i&gt; novels--based on the highly-lauded TV series that took the country by storm.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;             In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cylons&#39; Secret&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; by Craig Shaw Gardner, a ship, scavenging the outer settlements for valuable Cylon technologies after the first human-Cylon war, stumbles on a super-secret scientific outpost beyond charted space. Mere hours later, &lt;i&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/i&gt; receives a one-word distress call from the scavenging ship: &quot;Cylons,&quot; causing the young Colonel William Adama to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;             &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sagittarius Is Bleeding&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; by Peter David, concerns President Laura Roslin, whose prophetic dreams have infused her people with hope that they will find Earth, humanity&#39;s cradle.  But her new dreams of a galaxy overrun by the Cylons disturb her even as they energize an extremist political group. The threat of violent revolt puts Roslin at personal risk and endangers the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;             In&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by Steven Harper, Peter Attis, a rock star adored by all the fleet, including Starbuck, has recently been rescued from a Cylon prison ship. But after his first post-return concert, crewmembers are stricken by a strange malady that threatens to lay the fleet open to Cylon attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
