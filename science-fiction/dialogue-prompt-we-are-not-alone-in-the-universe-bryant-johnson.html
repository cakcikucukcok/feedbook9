  <title>Dialogue Prompt:We Are Not Alone In The Universe! - Bryant Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where nothing is ever as it seems, three separate families are drawn to a great and terrifying truth. After winning the New Hampshire state lottery, Brent Brook treats himself to a new satellite dish and discovers a channel dedicated to the strange happenings. Hundreds of miles away in Virginia, reporter Marc Dazet stumbles upon the story of the most recent lottery winner and sets out to track down Mr. Brook as an interesting piece. Far away from the watchful eyes of the media, the Johnsons, a relatively normal military family, are called away to help serve their country at a far off military base. The orders? Unclear. However, their move has future implications that will change the course of history forever. In time, their lives and their families&amp;rsquo; lives are thrown out of balance and the truth is revealed. One thing is for certain, &amp;ldquo;WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE!&amp;rdquo;" />
