      <meta name="description" content="CHICAGO to FARGO - In the not-so-distant future after the collapse of the US federal government, more than warlords, unrest, and religious fanaticism sweep the nation states. From secret societies long hidden to the modern world, an ancient threat, led by fox demon Danni Pan, re-emerges. 
Recluse Soren Anderson lost everything, including his own heart, while on assignment in China, and for thirty years he survives in the shadows, with only his soul keeping his body alive. He comes face to face with his estranged daughter moments before he is forced to flee the city-state of Chicago. With nowhere to run but home to Norma, North Dakota, together they must find ways to cross factious borders, evade the evil that will stop at nothing to find him and repair the relationship with his daughter that Soren never thought possible. 
But sometimes, as Soren soon learns, not even he can run fast enough, and he must fight to keep his daughter alive. For when forgiveness is not enough, blood must pay." />
