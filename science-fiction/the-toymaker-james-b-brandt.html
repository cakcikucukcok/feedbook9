  <title>The Toymaker - James B Brandt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul Johnson tracks an eccentric toy designer to a residence on the outskirts of Flagstaff, AZ. But there is more going on than just research on novel toys... reports of UFO&#39;s, brutal murders, and animal mutilations begin to surface all around the city.   Paul runs into a spunky waitress who agrees to show him around the Flagstaff area and help him pinpoint the toy maker&#39;s house. They arrive at dusk... just in time to become involved in an alien attack on the house. They quickly discover that the toy maker is more than just a little eccentric... and that life for all of them may have a very short timeline.   Through a harrowing attempt to escape the impending destruction of the toy maker&#39;s house, Paul and Stacy  become caught up in a case that reaches across Northeastern Arizona with death flaming up along their trail as they race to meet a most surprising conclusion... all revealed in Paul&#39;s notes and the ToyMaker file on his abandoned laptop." />
