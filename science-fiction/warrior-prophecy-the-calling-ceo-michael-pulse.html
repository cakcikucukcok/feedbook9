  <title>Warrior Prophecy : The Calling - CEO Michael Pulse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone looks for a calling finding more to handle, Mikha-él Taklishim a US Marine serving in Vietnam wanted peace of mind as he returned in 1969 for his mother&#39;s funeral. Uncertain if love really existed, both Mikha-él and Terki`îdu·šal&#39;s lives are altered, bound by political reason only allows so much, it is faith which takes the them the full distance. The fates of many rest on fulfilling a prophecy which all know the course but not the path, those looking for a guide are left to question where this leads. Destiny demands Mikha-él willing accept his part, thus leaving no blame on others, as children are raised in a family, young lives fraught with dangers for both society and family. A perfect society it isn&#39;t, with secrets protecting a few to press an empire into danger, the only relief to come as alliances form into a coming war. One not many will survive yet all have parts to play...and must willingly accept them all." />
