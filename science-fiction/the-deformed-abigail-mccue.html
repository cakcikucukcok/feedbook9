  <title>The Deformed - Abigail McCue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not long into the future, human beings undergo a poorly understood mass mutation, possibly in response to the unrestrained devastation of the environment. Along with being stronger, faster, and healthier, these new &amp;ldquo;dysmorphic&amp;rdquo; humans display animal-like characteristics, and have hidden abilities, such as telekinesis and telepathy. However, they are reviled and discriminated against by the population at large, become a convenient political scapegoat for society&amp;rsquo;s ills, and are generally considered sub-human. They are also covertly used for brutal state-sanctioned medical and pharmaceutical experiments.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly polarized society, a desperate band of dysmorphic people take matters into their own hands, striking out for social justice. But the consequences may pose bigger problems than the ones they are trying to redress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrilling, dramatic, and a cauldron of complex characters, &lt;em&gt;The Deformed&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant novel that speaks to the insecurity, violence, and oppression of our own times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
