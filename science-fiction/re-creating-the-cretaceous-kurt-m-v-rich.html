&lt;p&gt;
    Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the United States and other nations conducted numerous scientific experiments intent upon recovering and then replicating
    the DNA genomes of animals whose lives had been extinct for a period of over tens of thousands up to several millions of years. With no guidelines to
    follow and, even worse, no external monitoring, many formerly extinct life forms were eventually cloned and successfully re-created, but with deadly and
    destructive results. Most of the nations involved in such devastating experiments, including the United States, promptly responded by enacting highly
    controversial laws prohibiting both the research into replicating the DNA and the revival of such extinct creatures. While some nations reacted by passing
    bans on such research for twenty-five to fifty years, the United States enacted a ban of only twenty years, due to expire on January 1st, 2015. Other
    nations, including many third world countries, openly resisted the pressure put upon them by the larger nations and opted out of enacting any type of
    restrictions.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Sensing a shift in popular opinion during the two years preceding the expiration of the ban, the United States Congress began to conduct numerous hearings
    on the matter, including collecting the testimony of nearly one hundred fifty of the nations most prominent geneticists and scholars. Among the group
    invited to testify before Congress was Nicholas P. Heinz III, a thirty-two year old paleogeneticist and chairman of the highly esteemed research firm,
    BioGen, BioGenetics International Technologies, LLC, in Cupertino, California. One of the last witnesses called to testify, Heinz had hoped his
    impassioned testimony and detailed documentation of the myriad benefits derived from DNA genome research would help to continue the momentum gained from
    earlier witnesses and would sway the Congress into letting the ban expire without being renewed. From Kurt M. V. Rich, the author of the critically
    acclaimed historical novel &#39;Chasing the Golden Hoard: The Story of the Lydian Hoard,&#39; &#39;Re-Creating the Cretaceous&#39; invites you to investigate the story of
    scientific wonders intermingled with greed, arrogance, subterfuge, and a quest for power far beyond the imagination of Hollywood.
