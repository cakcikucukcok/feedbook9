  <title>Towerld Level 0005: The Expedition Launch to the Higher Levels - Doctor Deicide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You are going to have to explain this to me.&quot;  Even though Hector_1304 and Wendy have managed to sneak into the suite, they were ambushed by the Theriocephalic Thugs. Thanks to the storming support of Gideon the forger and the help from the Pluck Princess, the intruders seem to get out of the hot water. However, the drug lord, Haloom Ghoude, enters the scene with his underlings.  Hector_1304 has to explain the situation to the drug lord, or he and his friends have to face the calamitous consequences. The only surviving member of the Theriocephalic Thugs, Sus Scrofa, is determined to avenge his crippled comrades. The snorting forger, the immobilized diva, and the postal princess are of no help this time. Does the adventure to higher floors end here?  Hector_1304 wants to make a stunning comeback, by persuading the drug lord, by dealing with the last of the beast-headed guards, and by putting on a show to the servants of the Ghoude Corporation." />
