  <title>Mon-Ton : the Old Man and His Treasure - Vance Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of adventure and magic.  A fantasy book for both the young and old readers alike.  This is a story greatly enjoyed by 3rd and 4th graders. The Old Man from Mon-Ton had visited the village for as long as anyone could remember.  However, none gave him more than a passing thought.  That is until one day, a young man, Bowdean, could not stop thinking about the old man and where he lived.  He followed him to his home, built into the heart of the Great Mountain, Mon-Ton.  Bowdean was told that it was his &quot;Destiny&quot; to go on a quest.  The old man showed Bowdean how to cross the desert, capture an Elf to gain his help in getting past big lizards, face a Troll, cross a long valley, and find the key, a large ruby, to gain access to another scroll.  Using this scroll, Bowdean continued the quest, and found a Unicorn in a small valley.  The Unicorn turned into a Pegasus and flew Bowdean over the mountains into a grand canyon, right into a battle with many Dragons." />
