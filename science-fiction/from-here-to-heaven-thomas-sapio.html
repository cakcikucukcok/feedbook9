  <title>From Here to Heaven - Thomas Sapio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;FROM HERE TO HEAVEN&lt;/I&gt; is a heart warming inspirational novel that transcends time itself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;After his funeral, my fathers unsettled spirit comes to me. He tells me that I am the only one who can help him find his birth mother. With the help and guidance of his spirit and an old Indian head penny, he gives me the power to physically travel back in time as an observer to relive his past and beyond, to search for the mother he never knew. This magical and moving experience alternates me between the past and the present. It enables me to feel the same emotions as the people I see, and I become obsessed with finding his mother, the mother he only dreamt about.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;It is impossible not to be moved by this emotional journey in time. An obsession so powerful it is felt from the celestial realm beyond our world.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;I invite you to journey with me through the passages of time, as I search and walk with the spirits in &lt;I&gt;From Here to Heaven&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
