  <title>Faraway - Edmund Ironside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Earth Empire has developed incredible technology, and it has taken humans half way across the galaxy. Entire sentient species have been conquered, their worlds and inhabitants exploited brutally. Human technology and social structure has been used efficiently, but not wisely. A sense of malaise has gripped nearly all of the people, and they yearn for something better. Lost in a fog of bizarre state imposed controls, supported by endless propaganda, they don&#39;t know how to escape their meaningless existence. They don&#39;t even know what they want. At the outermost base called Faraway, a small group of humans learn of some ancient writings, although incomplete, suggesting there is more to life. Immersing themselves in the new way, they start discovering thoughts like respect, compassion, community, beauty, purpose, and especially love. It&#39;s a tenuous beginning, and there are those who will suppress the adherents of the new way. A struggle begins between the two opposing ways. The struggle spreads across the galaxy, and even beyond - from Faraway." />
