  <title>Sister Alice - Robert Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;An epic tale of visionary futures and scientific speculation.&quot;--Library Journal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of years from now, humanity will be on the brink of self-destruction. The world&#39;s great leaders have created an elite group who, by their superior wisdom and abilities, keep the peace, maintain progress, and otherwise safeguard humanity&#39;s future. Genetically enhanced, they are the carriers of Earth&#39;s greatest talents, a force unlike any in the history of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten million years, the Families dominated the galaxy. But then Alice, a brilliant scientist of the Chamberlain family, took part in an attempt to create a new galaxy. Her experiment unleashed vast forces that the family could not control, causing a catastrophe that killed untold billions of people on many worlds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she was punished for her role in the debacle, Alice visited Ord, a younger Chamberlain. Only he, of all the people in the galaxy, knows what Alice tells him. Her words launch him upon a quest that will take him across the vast reaches of space. He must discover his own true nature, and somehow restore the family honor. Sister Alice is his epic story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Sister Alice - Robert Reed</i></b> | Sister Alice is a great book. The title is bad though. Not because the story doesn't revolve aroud Alice who is the sister of the protagonist (because it does), but because it's lame and says nothing about the book and it misleads. And the cover is lame too: it shows some kind of spaceship, while there is not one spaceship throughout the whole book.<br /><b><i>Sister Alice by Robert Reed - Goodreads</i></b> | I love Robert Reed's work, and I am an enormous fan of the Great Ship series. Sister Alice is an early work of his, set in a far future, where elements of what became the Great Ship series, like human near immortality, are presented for the first time.<br /><b><i>Sister Alice: Reed, Robert: 9780765341471: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Sister Alice is an early work of his, set in a far future, where elements of what became the Great Ship series, like human near immortality, are presented for the first time. After a near total war threatened to destroy all of humanity, humanity is divided into immortal families who act(ed) as saviours for all and the rest of mortal humanity who envy them.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Sister Alice - Robert Reed</a> </h3></p><hr/>
