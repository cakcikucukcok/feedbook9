  <title>Modern Hobbies - Christopher S. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lawrence Thorne has been punching away the numbers at Pittsburgh-based super company Graffius Co. for twenty years; his body deteriorating until a new test program offers the chance to up his productivity. The small silver injections every week give the recipient a much-needed boost in all the wrong directions, Lawrence being one of nine dummy employees receiving their first dose.  Lost in an inevitable swirl of collected nostalgia tied to his deceased girlfriend, Bianca Deist, employee Thorne initially shows few improvements.  However, the spark comes in several forms by Friday. Lawrence&#39;s livelong friend, the recently-divorced Grace Emerson, returns to the Burg, soon seducing him into hysterics.  Unsure of his feelings, he desperately considers quitting his job and selling off his hobbies." />
