  <title>And Another Smile - Saber Baghery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carla Fritz, proud of her pompous pedigree and ambitions, holds herself superior to the best members of the organization. She has some preoccupations beyond her job. With the aid of her brother, Michael Fritz, another scientist of the organization, she has designed and made an apparatus called Radio Telesthesia, a device with the ability to transform various animals&#39; behavioral patterns into basic factors of human behaviors. In order to test the efficiency of the device before obtaining a patent for her invention, she takes it with her, almost secretly, to the location of her mission. 
She has already done some extensive research which indicated the probability that she would encounter some African kings of the beasts (lions); a probability that will be realized, incidentally, by her own reckless exit from the provisional campsite. It has been a result of her occasional lapses of prudence that the password of the Research Satellite which is one of the tools of the mission is entrusted to Steve Blake, despite Carla&#39;s being the commander of this two-member-team mission. Steve Blake is notified to keep a close eye on both Carla and the missionary affairs." />
