  <title>The Return of the Shadow Whistler - Royce Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a faraway village, a boy intently watches as his grandmother reads his cards. After she tells him his destiny will be forever tied to the failings of taught lessons and that he must overcome corruption and power with a pure heart, Michael suddenly realizes there is a world before him that harbors secrets and that nothing is as it seems. Meanwhile, moments after a young priest finds something in the sky he was never meant to see, he lies dead on the floor of a computer room as hard drives melt and a lone man ensures this is not the time for discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, Father Michael Vaetas is vacillating between his identity as priest and well-heeled academician as he learns the Papal Council for Scientific Investigations has appointed him to the section for astronomical studies. While Vaetas hopes he will finally be freed from the iron grip of the church, he instead is told the Council wants him to find a way to end time. As Vaetas travels through time on a dangerous journey to the truth, age-old religious institutions and faith collide as a negative power seeks to destroy the heritage of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting science fiction tale, loyalties are tested and a power is forced to prove its merit as a priest attempts to fulfill his destiny and all wonder whether the answer is shining among the stars.&lt;/p&gt;" />
