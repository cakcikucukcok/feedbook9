      <meta name="description" content="When Pete Mason&#39;s father is badly hurt in a space mining accident, eighteen-year-old Pete suspects that the injury was no accident -- that it was caused by his family&#39;s rivals, Rachel Barry and her children. Even so, when Pete receives an urgent call for help from Jane, Rachel&#39;s oldest daughter, he risks his life to save her, only to find that Jane&#39;s uncle has taken advantage of the opportunity to jump Pete&#39;s new mining claim. Pete is furious; he refuses to listen to Jane&#39;s story of a mysterious derelict rocket that appeared from nowhere to threaten her life.&lt;P&gt; But the two young people meet again, quite by accident, when they are both caught in the middle of a terrifying situation from which there seems to be no escape. The surprising explanation of the derelict rocketship, and the growing relationship between Pete and Jane, provides a fast-paced, thrilling climax to this beautifully written science fiction adventure." />
