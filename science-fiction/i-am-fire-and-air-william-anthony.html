  <title>I Am Fire and Air - William Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four Friends&lt;/br&gt;
Four Powers&lt;/br&gt;
Four Truths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONE: Always choose to care for and protect the least among us. We work to make the least become the greatest. TWO: Only do things that are principled; believe things that are true; preserve things that are precious. Being noble takes more courage than being loyal. THREE: There are very dark times when even basic human altruism must be an intentional act of rebellion. FOUR: What is done out of love is beyond good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four teenagers who will not be missed are held and exploited by a contractor for the Department of Defense. Their exceptional abilities are used to create advanced weapons. The secret and sealed facility where they live and work is invaded, triggering automatic defenses that kill everyone but them. The dark weapons they have produced are released. Survival and escape seem impossible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
