  <title>Legend of the Mighty Sparrow, Part 3 - Bryan Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This science fiction adventure represents the ultimate survivor genre, a hero against all odds, against powerful special interests too big to fail, a system controlled by ultimate insiders who often seem hell-bent on obsession, the last war, escalation, and world economic domination to create a brave new world; another dystopia.
And the story focuses on a black site scientist with an urgent mission: to reach the next underground bunker with unparalleled destruction and equipment that smoldersa place with sections that have damage beyond description, beyond all known languages from some unknown experiment, as the experiment may have fractured time or seriously damaged a local aspect of the universe.
As people often say, the most important trait is location-location-location, a real estate term regarding a vital place or vulnerable point.
And in this case, the concern is about a weapon of mass destruction, a favorite human pursuit since prehistoric times. And this weapon is not a mother of all bombs, not MOAB or the insidious neutron bomb, but a new-age experiment that directed a complex particle beam at a universal pressure point in spaceuniversal defect in space time or support aspect, well, similar to the way someone brings down a high-rise building by damaging the main support beam, and in this case, to collapse the universal wave function, as the universe may represent a bubble, a supreme algebraic bubble, a supreme bulkhead.
And this secret military experiment, one without checks and balances, appears to have punctured the universe with a special warp bubble pierce and might initiate deflation at faster-than-light speed to deflate the universe, as space can move faster than light, which in this case will quickly collapse the universe to bring about the end of days, eschatology, the final events of history, and the ultimate human destiny." />
