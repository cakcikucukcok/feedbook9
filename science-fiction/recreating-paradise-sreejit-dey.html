  <title>Recreating Paradise - Sreejit Dey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can one live without money, relationship and religion. How will life be without anyone of them and what will be the purpose of living if one cannot accumulate wealth, build relations and have a religion to follow, living like equals without being recognized for any achievements. All our life we lived generating wealth, thriving for even more, entwined with relations of our own since birth, developing more through marriage, having children. We remain eye-centric towards elevating our own, ignoring and eliminating those who rightly deserve, who can uplift our life and society. We feel proud of our religion ridiculing others and get agitated violently with a meager deviation, fearing loss of self esteem and wrath of our God. 
Entrapped at an alien planet astronaut Andrews, Nancy and Ben finds themselves in a planet where people live a life free from wealth, relationship and religion and all necessities are available free of cost just like paradise where anything is available at a beacon and none accumulates wealth nor they need to maintain a relationship, living happily without any worry or anxiety. Yet these three astronauts find life too boring and purposeless, yearning to return back to their planet where recognition and applaud lures." />
