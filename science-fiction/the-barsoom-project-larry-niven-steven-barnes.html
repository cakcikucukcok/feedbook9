  <title>The Barsoom Project - Larry Niven, Steven Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Barsoom Project&lt;/i&gt; is the direct sequel to 1981&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dream Park.  &lt;/i&gt;Eviane&#39;s first visit to the-state-of-art amusement arena Dream Park ended in disaster: the special effects had seemed more real than life... until the holograms she was shooting with live ammunition turned out to be solid flesh and blood... and very, very dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haunted by the past, rebounding from a lengthy spell in a mental hospital, she has returned to Dream Park to exorcise a nightmare that has become reality.  But in Dream Park, nothing is what it seems. The Inuit mythology controlling the images is part of a &quot;Fat Ripper Special&quot; designed to implant new behavioral memes. The players are struggling against the game master, one another, and their own demons. And there is a killer who wants to ensure Eviane never regains her memory...noo matter what it costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending together hard science fiction with topical RPG-like fantasy games, &lt;i&gt;The Barsoom Project&lt;/i&gt; is SF at the cutting edge and a classic creation from two of the genre&#39;s most beloved writers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
