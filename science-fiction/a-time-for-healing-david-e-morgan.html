  <title>A Time for Healing - David E. Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today, in real families, only a very small portion of the population comes from nurturing and supportive homes; most individuals have been products of dysfunctional families instead. In A Time for Healing, author Dr. David E. Morgan provides a study of a dysfunctional family and presents principles necessary for sustaining a healthy family unit.&lt;br&gt;
Through the interplay of the fictional, four-generation Gardner family, A Time for Healing illustrates some events that can cause a family to be dysfunctional, reveals the carnage left from the pain, and discusses how to eradicate it. The Gardners story shows how unhealthy family rules of behavior are passed down from parents to children and what a devastating effect this process has on families, relationships, organizational lives, and society. With ideas gleaned from more than forty years as an educator in the Chicago public schools, including both part-time and full time in higher education, Morgan shows how we can envision and create a better way forward and avoid the imperfections of family dysfunction in the future. &lt;br&gt;
A Time for Healing offers help for reclaiming the family by creating real, effective positive change. Cleaning up the family is about character, communication, forgiveness, healing, integrity, love, redemption, respect, understanding and the ownership of our acts. &lt;br&gt;" />
