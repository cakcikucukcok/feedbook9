  <title>Winged - Shelby Rayn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hidden in the outskirts of the Rocky Mountains, innocent young creatures are being tortured for the sake of science and the well-being of mankind. Its here at the DNA Alteration Experimentation Laboratorymore commonly referred to as DAELthat ten-year-old Jay and eleven-year-old Sara become friends. Jays genetic code has been spliced with that of a bird of prey, and Sara is a three-way blend of a human, bird, and cat. Other childrens DNA has been combined with that of fish, wolves, lions, lizards, and plant materialand horrible experiments have been conducted on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Jay has lost two siblings, she gains a power that helps her and thirty-five other mutated children to escape from this whack-job science lab. Jay and her newfound friends journey in the world outside of DAEL, one for which they are not prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAEL, however, isnt so willing to let any of them escape. The scientists have sent some of their most successful experiments after the children: the warhounds, human-wolf hybrids. Whats more, the labs newest creationsa set of robotic, wolf-like creatureshave also been deployed to hunt them down. The children must rely on their strengths and courage if they want to survive in a world outside of the lab that has been their home for years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
