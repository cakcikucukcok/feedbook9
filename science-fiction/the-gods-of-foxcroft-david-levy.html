  <title>The Gods of Foxcroft - David Levy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Earth has been reduced to a vast laboratory, it&#39;s people survivors of carbon-saturated air that increased surface temperature, melted giant glaciers, turned land into swamp and forced population into drastically reduced habitable areas.  Observing these survivors from space are human beings whose evolution has been as startling as it was predictable centuries before from known biology, medicine and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs is a world of instant molecular restructuring of matter, of people without need for sleep, free of all presently known diseases, capable of implanting complete memory systems, of altering humans to survive in any environment, on any planet.  It is a time when time is meaningless, when human life is created outside the uterus, and death is a dispensation from Foxcroft, not a natural result or individual right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into this time and this world, restored, reborn from their cryogenic capsules by now highly sophisticated techniques, come a man and a woman from the twentieth century.  Their very human story involves the drama of their sudden awakening into a world they never made or expected.  Theirs also, in a very new world, is a very old story about a man and a woman in love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
