  <title>Machine Man: Genesis - W.L. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine . . . a new lease on life? 
New York City , the near future: John Smith is a simple, 46-year-old artist who is lives a semi-reclusive existence in NYC. Stricken with cancer, Smiths undergoes a dramatic change when he falls prey to a covert, cutting-edge government project. 
Now, with his body suddenly cancer-free but his mind in chaos, John Smith sets out to find the answers to the questions about his new life. But when he falls in love with a beautiful young woman, his search for the truth takes an unusual twist. Suddenly willing to accept things as they are, Smith tries to put his past behind him and live a simple and normal existence. 
On his trail, however, is an evil, sadistic U.S. government whose sights are set on global domination, and those plans require the involvement of Smith  as well as his new found extraordinary abilities. 
The greatest sci-fi novels in existence are actually blunt social commentaries in sleek clothing, and W.L. Smiths debut novel is no different. 
In a stunning debut offering, W.L. Smith pens a tale that mirrors the qualities of the greatest sci-fi novels in existence: an intricate storyline laden with compelling characters, brisk momentum, and a scathing commentary on human society. 
A powerful fable about human societys dark future, and the essence of human life, MACHINE MAN: GENESIS, is one explosive, thought-provoking thriller; one that could soon find its way to the movie theaters in the near future.
