  <title>CLASH OF TWO WORLDS - Norman Baltson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Her pursuit of the formula for the magical blue and red drinks and her goal to uncover a priest&amp;rsquo;s murder bring Helga Brown, a Harvard theology student, to Norgan Devilov&amp;rsquo;s sprawling mansion in the Smokies on Friday evening. Soon, the two are attracted to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third day, Sunday morning, she and Norgan are shocked to learn that twenty hydrogen bombs timed to go off in twenty-four hours are installed in the world&amp;rsquo;s fifteen megacities and five holiest sites. Although he and she have nothing to do with this global mayhem, there is some evidence showing they are linked to this catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, suspecting them to be perpetrators, the US President orders a massive military operation to surround the entire Smoky Mountains to capture Helga and Norgan. But unknown wrongdoers, claiming to be acting on behalf of God, halt the military advances and take him and her to an impenetrable giant cavern, which has many natural wonders and the magnificent Palace of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bribing one of the captors with three million pounds of gold and putting up a deadly fight against others, Helga and Norgan break free but find out the cavern has no exit. Then, in a desperate attempt to resolves the world&amp;rsquo;s nuclear threat and searching for the perpetrator, they consume the red liquid from the Palace of God and depart to the parallel universe which has stunningly beautiful nature and diverse types of people. There, they face threats to their lives and are chased to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the clock for nuclear bombs is ticking, Helga and Norgan must survive and find a solution to the crisis the world is facing. All along, their romantic relations develop, and they undergo perilous adventures together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
