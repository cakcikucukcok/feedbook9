  <title>A Science Fantasia - Francis A. Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author, Francis A. Andrew, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland in the United Kingdom. Although not a scientist by training or profession, he has always maintained an interest in science and technology throughout his life. He was greatly influenced by the works of the late Sir Fred Hoyle which he started reading at a very young age. Hoyle taught him to think in a critical and logical fashion. Hoyles works of fiction have built into them the possibility of their becoming science fact at some future date. It is with this concept in mind that Francis Andrew has written A Science Fantasia. While we forge ahead ever onwards and upwards with our scientific and technological achievements, our moral state seems not only to be static but in actual regress. Andrew believes that unless mankind faces up to its moral obligations and places its scientific research within a viable ethical framework, the technology upon which our lives so much depend could well prove to be the rope by which the human species collectively hangs itself. Francis Andrew currently works at the College of Applied Sciences in Nizwa, Oman where he teaches English.&lt;/p&gt;" />
