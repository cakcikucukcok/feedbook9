  <title>In the Shadow of the City - Norman Ahmad, Hassan Ahmad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shadows that live above the law, confronts the Ghost that exist below in the human subconscious. The visible world is diluted with distractions; because sometimes its what you cant see that gives you the greatest insights.
Seasoned ESD detective Neil Noble has incidentally acquired the gift to see aberrations in things ordinary people find innocuous, shadows. Upon returning from his last away mission to Earths sister planet, he assumes he is just having occupational related visual side effects. It soon becomes clear that a rouge group of social agitators with advanced technology are causing disorder in the smilingly peaceful city. Noble is in total disarray until an extreme religious figure known only as 2AD, gives him knowledge that completely changes his perception of the once calm world that he thought he knew.
Prepare to leave the visual world behind and journey into the cosmic space of shadows." />
