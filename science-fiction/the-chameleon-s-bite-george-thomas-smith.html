  <title>The Chameleon’S Bite - George Thomas Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel, The Chameleons Bite is about an attempt by a secret hit squad under the guise of a legitimate military operation to do international crimes to increase hatred for the United States because of unauthorized assassinations in various corners of the globe. When Thomas Bernardo finds out that his patriotism and special training is being misused. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomas joined the military because he believed it was a way to escape his crime ridden neighborhood in New York. He wanted to make something positive of his life. Tomas had an unusual ability to learn languages and accents. He became a superior sniper and able to blend into many cultures. His missions were to infiltrate countries for the purpose of neutralizing a supposed threat to strategic interests of the United States. By eliminating a targeted bad guy Tomas believed he was serving his country, until during captivity in Afghanistan he became aware of information that led him to believe there was a terrorist mole, named Kareem Karab, high up in the U. S. government and associated with his operations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomas knew too much and attempts were made to kill him on several missions. Bernardos disgust for being duped into committing capital crimes compelled him to exact revenge against Colonel Tag Taggart, the officer who recruited him to the unit. A squad of assassins chases Tomas across international borders until there was a final resolution in Haiti." />
