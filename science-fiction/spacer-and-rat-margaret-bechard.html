  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Spacer and Rat - Margaret Bechard</i></b> | Spacer and Rat, by Margaret Bechard, is an amazing sci-fi story that will keep you not only entertained but surprised as well. I have never read another book like this, but I am hoping more will come out. The characters fit in very well with the story. The description of the scenery was thorough but sometimes difficult to understand.<br /><b><i>Spacer and Rat: Bechard, Margaret: 9781596430587: Amazon ...</i></b> | Spacer and Rat by Margaret Bechard is a young adult science fiction novel that I am very happy I discovered by accident. This book is a story about two teenagers living on a space station. Jack is a Spacer, a native of the space stations that dot the galaxy, whose aptitude tests placed him in the food service industry.<br /><b><i>Spacer and Rat by Margaret Bechard - Goodreads</i></b> | Margaret Bechard is the author of Star Hatchling, winner of the DucKon Golden Duck Award for Excellence in Science Fiction, and Hanging On to Max, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults and School Library Journal Best Book of the Year.
