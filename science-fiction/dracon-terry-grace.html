  <title>Dracon - Terry Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Alexander Drake has always known he was different from other people, but he never really knew how different. Since childhood he was taught to conceal his true strength from those around him, and for twenty-five years, his secret held until strange new abilities started manifesting themselves when a deep extraction mission goes wrong. Later David finds himself in need of his gifts when a top secret recon fighter is shot down in Antarctica and his strike platoon is sent. Things heat up in the frozen arctic when David finds himself going head to head with the European Alliances top field commander in a run-and-gun race to stop an invasion. 
Next, when an ambitious admiral tracks an alien craft to a small island off the coast of South America, he see an opportunity to breathe new life into his stalled career. But, when his recovery teams repeatedly vanish into the jungle without a trace, he reaches out to his political allies for help. Soon after, David and his team find themselves in the middle of an alien hunting frenzy. Hunted by creatures from their darkest nightmare, David and his lifelong friend Manny, who is not quite what he seems, find themselves locked in a desperate battle for survival. When the woman he loves is struck down, David unleashes the full force of the power that dwells within him.
Disgraced and drummed out of strike command for striking a superior officer, David and Manny find themselves working as instructors for a special operations training unit. When a mysterious spaceship the size of an aircraft carrier shows up, they are called into action once more. But this time David must face the greatest challenge of his lifehis true destiny." />
