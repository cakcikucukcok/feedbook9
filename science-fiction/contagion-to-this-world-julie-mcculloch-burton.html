  <title>Contagion to This World - Julie McCulloch Burton</title>

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Earth with a burst of speed and a trail of dark exhaust, the Saturnian Space Agency performed what had become routine: Eight people were on their way to relieve the entire crew of a low- Earth orbit space research station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the agencys flight surgeons or to the crew itself, a hypervirulent bacterium had hitched a ride. For one week, both crews mingled and then the crew that had been relieved flew home for the usual six month break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, though, they would not be returning to the space station. A superbug had arrived with a healthy-looking crewmember. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zander, our very own Typhoid Mary, brought with her death in the form of a pan-resistant superinfection Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes typhoid fever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ive read your reports. Youve briefed me on-station. I relieve you, Zander stated formally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I stand relieved, Echo spoke just as formally but was slouched in a chair, and then she clicked-off comms to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now, she whooped, lets get this party started! &lt;/p&gt;" />
