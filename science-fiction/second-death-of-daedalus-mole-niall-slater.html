  <title>Second Death of Daedalus Mole - Niall Slater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daedalus Mole wants to make the best of a bad situation. The plan: fly his unwanted passenger, Erin, to her destination, squeeze her for every last penny, then immediately find refuge in the nearest pub. Unfortunately, when the galaxy is on the verge of economic collapse and your passenger has a bounty the size of a planet on her head, there’s only so much another drink can do to help.  Daedalus soon finds himself playing babysitter to someone stronger, angrier and far more dangerous than he is. On top of that: the booze is running out, his ship’s AI won’t stop trying to kill him, and he’s having to pretend very hard that he hasn’t started hearing voices in his head. Erin is under the eye of forces which seek to use her. Daedalus&#39;s mistakes have changed him in ways he does not yet understand.  In search of Erin&#39;s past, and in flight from his own, Daedalus will soon learn what happens when you let wounds fester unchecked.  &lt;i&gt;The Second Death of Daedalus Mole &lt;/i&gt;was longlisted for the inaugural Bath Novel Award. It&#39;s a character-driven novel which tells the story of two damaged, guilt-ridden misfits struggling to find closure in a galaxy on the cusp of war, whilst becoming slowly entangled in the struggles of greater forces. In one sense it’s a traditional star-hopping journey with an unlikely crew of miscreants, but in another it’s an exploration of scars, self-destruction, healing and loneliness, as well as the flawed ways in which we view those closest to us.  It’s also a novel about bar fights and space battles, so there’s something for everyone, really." />
