After turning down his powerful father&amp;#39;s offer of a desk job as an ambassador, Jander is heading back to the war zone. After joining an emergency reaction force of combat veterans known as the Orphans, Jander must work hard to get his platoon in shape for the next deployment&amp;#8212;while learning the ropes himself.
