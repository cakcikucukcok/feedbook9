  <title>Pharaohs of the Sky - Robert L. Ballantyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine that everything you know is wrong.
In Cairo, after uncovering evidence he believes will alter humanitys perception of its own history, an eminent university professor is viciously murdered. 
In another part of the Egyptian capital, a determined police inspector will stop at nothing to find the murderer. 
In Toronto, one of the worlds leading ancient-astronaut proponents receives a startling message to decode a mysterious set of coordinates.
In another part of Ontario, a young, self-employed wrought iron designer is convinced he is somehow involved.
And in the sky, someone is watching
Thus begins Robert L. Ballantynes debut novel. From the streets of Toronto to a secretive Washington book shop, from the heart of Cairo to the peaks of the great pyramids, Pharaohs of the Sky lures you into a world where nothing is as it seems, and where clandestine operatives conspire to hide the truth. In this international mystery, fact remains elusive by design and fate alike, yet all revolves around the answer to one question: Are we really alone? 
Its time to question everything we think we know." />
