  <title>Testing Liberty: Book Two in the Liberty Trilogy - Theresa A Linden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in the not-so-distant future, where the government controls society through indoctrination, population control, and the eradication of the family, Liberty bides her time in Aldonia&amp;rsquo;s Re-Education facility. If she fails to escape and rescue the others, the children, teens and adults of the Maxwell Colony will be integrated into society, facing sterilization and indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She is not alone in the desire to rescue the colonists. An underground, anti-government group has been rescuing people from Aldonia for years, but never have they attempted to rescue so many at one time. To do so would risk exposing, even ending, their operation. Dedrick, one of the top rescuers, grieves for his family members who are now residents of government&amp;rsquo;s facilities. He wants Liberty free, but he is opposed to working with her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Racing through the wild, the underground and sordid inner-city slums, &lt;em&gt;Testing Liberty&lt;/em&gt; follows Liberty from one trial to another, to her final sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
