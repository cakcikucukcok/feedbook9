  <title>The 16th Golden Age of Science Fiction MEGAPACK ®: 18 Stories by William C. Gault - William C. Gault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Campbell Gault (1910-1995) was an American writer. He wrote under his own name, as well as (among others) the pseudonyms Roney Scott, Larry Sternig, and Will Duke. He is probably best remembered for his sports fiction, particularly the young-readers&#39; novels he began publishing in the early 1960s. Gault was also an acclaimed mystery writer. He was not limited to sports and mysteries, though-he also wrote a substantial body of  science fiction. (Admittedly, he did mix crime and sports into his science fiction!) We believe this volume is the largest collection of his fantastic work ever produced. Included are:&lt;P&gt; SCRAP IRON&lt;BR&gt; VENUSIAN INVADER&lt;BR&gt; CLUTCH OF MORPHEUS&lt;BR&gt; TOTAL RECALL&lt;BR&gt; BREATH OF BEELZEBUB&lt;BR&gt; THE HESITANT ANGEL&lt;BR&gt; MADE TO MEASURE&lt;BR&gt; LET&#39;S DO IT AGAIN&lt;BR&gt; FOG&lt;BR&gt; I&#39;LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS&lt;BR&gt; THIS WAY TO MARS&lt;BR&gt; JOY RIDE&lt;BR&gt; THE HUDDLERS&lt;BR&gt; THE MIGHTY DEAD&lt;BR&gt; ELECTION CAMPAIGN&lt;BR&gt; THE WOMAN OBSESSION&lt;BR&gt; TITLE FIGHT&lt;BR&gt; ESCAPE FEROCITY&lt;P&gt; If you enjoy this book, search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see the 200+ other entries in the series, covering science fiction, modern authors, mysteries, westerns, classics, adventure stories, and much, much more!&lt;P&gt; Other Golden Age of Science Fiction volume focus on:&lt;P&gt; 1.
