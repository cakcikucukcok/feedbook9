      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For most of her life, Nora has had a feeling she is being followed by something evil. While vacationing in Armenia with her mother, Nora feels a presence again while on a guided hike toward a mountain lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the group stumbles upon two buildings with ancient carvings, Noras curiosity is heightenedparticularly when she enters the building and feels she has been there before. But then strange events begin to occur: she sees mysterious balls of lights emerging from stones, a priest warns her that the end is near, and she and her mother eat in a diner that disappears into thin air as soon as they depart. She knows she has stumbled onto something much bigger than herself. There is only one person who can help Nora uncover the mystery on top of the mountain and behind the necklace that hangs around her neck. Together, Nora and Professor Zaven Korbian embark on a dangerous journey to search for Noras identity where they forced to accept the possibility that aliens may be covertly living amid the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting science fiction tale, a professor and a young girl determined to never stop looking for answers are about to discover they hold the secret to unlocking the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
