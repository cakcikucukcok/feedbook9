  <title>Detox - John Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred and fifty years of advancing technology has done much to promote the success of the human race...or has it?  This fast-paced technological thriller may have some clues.&lt;/P&gt;
Fast forward a century and a half to the platinum age of medicine and an Earth pursuing a large-scale colonization effort on Mars. While the pacemaker may have been one of the first devices implanted in a person, it surely will not be the last. The ever-shrinking integrated circuit will most certainly find its way into our systems. Stem-cell research, in its infancy now, will likely progress into a beneficial method of the prevention and treatment of disease. Like their predecessors, Cancer, AIDS, Ebola and the like will surely be wiped out. &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Detox&lt;/I&gt; is a taught thriller, with mystery, suspense, loads of action, and a dash of romance. Mans inhumanity to man takes center stage in a quest for truth, justice, and retribution. And with the worlds largest corporations, Dual-Planet and Molentel, and the deadly Plasma Virus intertwined in a massive colonization effort on the Red Planet, maybe the bottom line needs to be taken into account." />
