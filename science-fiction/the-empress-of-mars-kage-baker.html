  <title>The Empress of Mars - Kage Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the British Arean Company founded its Martian colony, it welcomed any settlers it could get. Outcasts, misfits and dreamers emigrated in droves to undertake the grueling task of terraforming the cold red planet--only to be abandoned when the BAC discovered it couldn&#39;t turn a profit on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Mary Griffith, a determined woman with three daughters, who opened the only place to buy a beer on the Tharsis Bulge. It&#39;s the story of Manco Inca, whose attempt to terraform Mars brought a new goddess vividly to life; of Stanford Crosley, con man extraordinaire; of Ottorino Vespucci, space cowboy and romantic hero; of the Clan Morrigan, of the denizens of the Martian Motel, and of the machinations of another Company entirely, all of whom contribute to the downfall of the BAC and the founding of a new world. But Mary and her struggles and triumphs is at the center of it all, in her bar, the Empress of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the Hugo-nominated novella of the same name, this is a rollicking novel of action, planetary romance, and high adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

The Empress of Mars is set in an alternate history, where Mars was settled by the British Arean Company, and then mostly left to dry up as unprofitable. A few hardscrabble settlers, emigrating to Mars for the usual reasons that misfits emigrate to backwater frontiers, or else abandoned by the Company when they were no longer useful, are now scratching out a living there.<br /><b><i>The Empress of Mars by Kage Baker - Goodreads</i></b> | The Empress of Mars is a charming foray from a different perspective into Baker's Company universe. While her previous tales focus on the cyborgs that form the primary workforce of Dr. Zeus, Inc., this tale is told from a normal Human perspective...however, the author makes abundantly clear that the cyborgs of Dr. Zeus are, like all matters important to history, manipulating the situation from the inside.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Empress of Mars - Kage Baker</a> </h3></p><hr/>
