  <title>Miranda Revealed - T J Henley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Set in the period 2012  2035 is based on a war between the Rigilion Empire and people of Earth which has been on-going for 3500 years when Emperor Kane
    last attacked the Earth. Earth is destroyed and the humans now live on Mars with the old Martians. Prof Mike Anderson is sent into deep space to find a new
    home and help for the humans. He finds the Federation of Planets and the Old Martians who left Mars 3800 years ago after the first war with the Rigilions.
    Emperor Kane is now out of his long, 3500 year sleep in charge of the Rigilion Empire and now rules it as it was in his youth, barbarically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Old Ones were a very advanced civilisation, also very interested in Earth, formerly Utopia and left our galaxy 25000 years ago. The Federation have
    been waiting thousands of years for their return, and searching for the right man to do this job. When Prof. Mike Anderson is brought to Mirad, the capital
    planet of the Federation, the High Priests realise their long wait has come to an end. After long talks and learning more of him, Prof. Mike Anderson is
    named the Chosen One. It is up to him to defeat Emperor Kane and bring peace to the galaxy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    To accomplish this, he will need all the help he can get from Admiral Hayes and King Ramesses IV on Mars. The only way back is through the Miranda Gate,
    but it is locked closed and in the middle of the star Miranda, the same star Emperor Kane sent into their system to destroy the Earth. Mike must retake
    planets that have been under Rigilion control for thousands of years and try to overthrow Emperor Kane. He must accomplish this and find the Light Bearer,
    who will assist him in bringing back the Old Ones from where they have been for the past 25000 years. However, if they bring back the Old Ones, will they
    help the current people of the galaxy move forward, take over the galaxy themselves or bring another species with them who might be deadlier than the
    Rigilions?
