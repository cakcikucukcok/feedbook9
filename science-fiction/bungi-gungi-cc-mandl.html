  <title>Bungi Gungi - Cc Mandl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; RULES AT WORK and home are of paramount importance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nigel Bullstone, however, has no respect for parameters of any kind.  Behind exemplary behaviour and pressed suits, he enjoys a wildly different life in his head.  This deception is exposed by chance, and his livid father books him into a hard-line motivational course to straighten him out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His journey to absolution is waylaid when his car and his nerves break down en-route.  A stranger called Winston rescues him from the roadside; in a mutinous state he accepts a dodgy invitation to go camping in lieu of obeying orders, and then learns that Winston&#39;s openly hostile friend, Ramon, is to join them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stressed out, his unfettered thoughts run amok.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He finds himself poised on the edge of madness and the Highest Bungi Jump on Earth; the stupefying leap into nothingness produces a bizarre entity that claims to be his Alter Ego and Personal Counsel.  And it is not alone.  Ramon has acquired one, and Winston has had one all along.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nigel&#39;s life takes on a new perspective.
