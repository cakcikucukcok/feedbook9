  <title>“Code Centaurus” - Francis Lentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Colin Grier is ordered by a covert office in the World Health Organization to investigate a bizarre disease outbreak in New Guinea, he is introduced to a fantastic world of possibilities that he never dreamed existed. While in New Guinea, he meets a beautiful, paralyzed woman called Margo, who is travelling with her father aboard a privately funded research ship in search of an ancient Khmer temple. While onboard, Margo and Colin become fast friends, and Margo eventually discloses that she has psychic abilities. Her visions eventually lead Colin to some twelfth-century Khmer temple ruins, where they discover part of an ancient telescope. Although the find is a major victory for anthropology, the group also discovers the source of the disease outbreak within the temple, and Colin is forced to choose between stopping the disease at its source and curing Margos paralysis. But with an impending attack from the World Health Organizations SWAT team, Colin must decide: will he save the woman he loves or choose to stop the spreading disease-and possibly change the course of history." />
