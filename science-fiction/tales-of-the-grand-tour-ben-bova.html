  <title>Tales of the Grand Tour - Ben Bova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; New tales of humanity&#39;s near-future exploration of the Solar System, from a science fiction master and award-winning author Ben Bova&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In novels like &lt;i&gt;Mars&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Moonbase&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Venus, Jupiter&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Saturn&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Privateers&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; The Precipice&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Rock Rats&lt;/i&gt;, Ben Bova has been telling the stories of the wars and rivalries, the outsize individuals, public crusades, and private passions that will drive us as we expand into the Solar System and make use of its vast resources. And throughout, Bova has shown our cosmic neighborhood as we know it to be, giving us a sense of Venus and Jupiter and the Asteroid Belt and Mars that&#39;s as up-to-date as the latest observations. For the last two decades have been a golden age of near-Earth astronomy and observation, and in his novels Bova has made dramatic use of our newest knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But during that time Bova has also written short fiction about some of the same events and characters---Sam Gunn, Martin Humphries, Klaus Fuchs, Dan Randolph, the Asteroid Wars. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Tales of the Grand Tour&lt;/i&gt;, those stories are collected in book form for the first time, creating a volume that is a landmark of modern SF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
