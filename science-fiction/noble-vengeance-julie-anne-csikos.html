  <title>Noble Vengeance - Julie Anne Csikos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All Madixyna Battore has to do is find her husband, Vynn, and help him escape from prison. But the task is easier said than done. Vynn has been captured by Shynk Faids, a politically savvy tyrant from the planet Carakquas, who wants something from Max and Vynn and will stop at nothing to get it, even if that means murdering one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief stricken after failing in her mission, Max resigns from the Agency and escapes to Earth, taking the secrets Vynn died for with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several years away from the agency, Max is lured back to a special mission by the prospect of seeking revenge on Faids, who has been searching for her ever since their last encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this science fiction tale laced with adventure and deception, a young captain rekindles her passion for space travel as she attempts to settle the score with the man who robbed her of the man she married and the life she loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
