  <title>The Neon Palm of Madame Melancon - Will Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lord Vishnu&amp;#39;s Love Handles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;comes the first novel ever marketed for the sole amusement of the billionaire class. While perhaps the most expensive e-book ever published,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Neon Palm of Madame Melancon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is only a fraction of the cost of a presidential weekend at Mar-Lago, a Birkin handbag, or even a first class pee-pee party in Moscow. For mere plutocrat peanuts, you can now read an e-book written for the minds of Sergi Brin, Ivanka Trump, Mark Zuckerberg, and that guy who owns Chick-fil-A.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, Ivanka and Chick-Fil-A guy, this sci-fi adventure was designed specifically for people like you, people who demand luxury, people who have, up until now, been forced to download regular non-luxury e-books onto their gold-plated Kindles. Our exquisite little novel fixes all that&amp;mdash;a&amp;nbsp;luxury e-book for people who&amp;nbsp;want to &amp;quot;suck out all the marrow of life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To those of lesser financial means, we do realize that spending this kind of money on a novel may seem extravagant, maybe even frivolous&amp;mdash;what with the water in Flint, Michigan and those kids in Syria. But one day, we may come out with a regular person edition for people like yourselves (think Tesla in five years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,&amp;nbsp;today our focus is squarely on acquiring a top 1% readership. At Middle Finger Press, we are striving to break&amp;nbsp;the barriers of price, literacy, and even decency with our Billionaire Book Club 1st editions. In fact&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;this&amp;nbsp;exclusive&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;e-book is specifically&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;targeted to the minds bold enough and the hearts brave enough to put dents into universes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaires!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For you people, you crazy ones, you square pegs in round holes, truly are the only ones who can change our future when it comes to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are our only hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robots are coming, boys and girls, our antibiotics are failing, and it&amp;rsquo;s getting hotter every day. So let this science fiction novel be the first place to spark your desire for a brighter future. We need your help to save this small blue planet, billionaires. We need your imagination and your dreams, and most of all&amp;nbsp;your empathy. And that surprisingly enough can start&amp;nbsp;with reading small works of fiction like this one. That&amp;#39;s the thought anyway.&lt;/p&gt;" />
