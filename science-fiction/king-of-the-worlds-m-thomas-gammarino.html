  <title>King of the Worlds - M. Thomas Gammarino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dark comedy explores the lost universes of disgraced idol Dylan Greenyears. Dylan had always wanted to live as many lives as he could&amp;#8212;that was the appeal of being an actor. But at the end of a brief stint as a Hollywood heartthrob, Dylan loses the lead in &lt;i&gt;Titanic &lt;/I&gt;and exiles himself and his wife to a recently settled exoplanet called New Taiwan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, life beyond Earth seems uncannily un-wondrous. Dylan teaches at an American prep school, raises a family with his high school sweetheart, and lives out his restlessness through literature. But then a box of old fan mail (and the hint of a galaxy-wide conspiracy) offers Dylan a chance to recapture the past. As he tries to balance this transdimensional midlife crisis against family life, Dylan encounters a cast of extraordinary characters: a supercomputer with aspirations of godhood, a Mormon-fundamentalist superfan, an old-school psychoanalyst, a sampling of his alternate selves, and, once again, the love of his lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;King of the Worlds &lt;/I&gt;throws cosmology, technology, nineties pop culture, and religion into an existential blender for a mix that is by turns tragic and absurd, elegiac and filled with wonder.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;M. Thomas Gammarino &lt;/B&gt;is the author of the novel &lt;i&gt;Big in Japan &lt;/I&gt;and the novella &lt;i&gt;Jellyfish Dreams&lt;/I&gt;. His short fiction has appeared in the &lt;i&gt;New York Tyrant&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tinfish&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Word Riot&lt;/I&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;Hawai&#39;i Review&lt;/I&gt;, among others. In 2014, Gammarino received the Elliot Cades Award for Literature, Hawaii&#39;s highest literary honor. He lives and teaches in Honolulu, Hawaii.&lt;/div&gt;" />
