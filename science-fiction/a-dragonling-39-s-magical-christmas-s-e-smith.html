  <title>A Dragonling&#39;s Magical Christmas - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="USA Today Bestseller!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Valdier, Sarafin, and Curizan Lords had children who just cannot stop getting into trouble! There is nothing as cute or funny as magical, shapeshifting kids, and nothing as heartwarming as family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Ariel mentions another human holiday, the women get excited. They aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones, though. The Dragon Lords and their friends decide they want to be part of the planning this time. Things get a little out of hand when the men begin competing with each other to create the best Christmas ever for the dragonlings, Roam, and Alice. While telling the children tales of St. Nick, Rudolph, Frosty, and the Old Dragon of the Mountain, they try to light up the palace like never before and turn it into the new North Pole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just when the women think they have everything under control, panic ignites when the children take it upon themselves to search for the legendary dragon threatening to steal the Magic of Christmas!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, their parents are in a race to find the dragonlings before they lose them forever. Will they be able to find them and celebrate the magic of the season or will the Dragon of the Mountain keep them hidden forever?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of mischief and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
