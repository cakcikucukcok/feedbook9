  <title>The Warriors of Eda - D. C. Claymore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 2037, and the Darkness and its army have invaded the world of Rylaxon and its six moons. The Vampeer population subjugates humanity, feeding on the helpless population and turning unwilling citizens into soldiers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year-old Biron Coomra, a child created by a biophysicist from Rylaxon and a powerful witch from a distant alien world planet called Earth, is living on Eda, the still-peaceful fifth moon. Although he has lost his magical abilities, he still has numerous gifts that make him a formidable enemy of evil--and he is connected to the Triune, a powerful deity who sometimes speaks through him. Biron and his friends--the Warriors of Eda--are summoned to save a select group, the Chosen, and bring them to this safe haven. Meanwhile, Gorgos, the leader of the Vampeer forces and Birons archnemesis, leads his troops to destroy Birons birth city and force a showdown, and the queen of a race of inhuman hunters, the Vorax, has her sights set on the boy as well. The warriors must rescue the Chosen and raise an army before time runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this novel, the third in a series, a boy with unique powers faces enemies on multiple fronts as he and his friends seek to bring the chosen to Eda and protect their world from Darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
