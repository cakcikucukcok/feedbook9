  <title>The Moon Maze Game - Larry Niven, Steven Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Year: 2085.  Humanity has spread throughout the solar system.  A stable lunar colony is agitating for independence.  Lunar tourism is on the rise...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this background, professional &quot;Close Protection&quot; specialist Scotty Griffin, fresh off a disastrous assignment, is offered the opportunity of a lifetime: to shepherd the teenaged heir to the Republic of Kikaya on a fabulous vacation.  Ali Kikaya will participate in the first live action role playing game conducted on the Moon itself.  Having left Luna--and a treasured marriage--years ago due to a near-tragic accident, Scotty leaps at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Action Role Playing attracts a very special sort of individual: brilliant, unpredictable, resourceful, and addicted to problem solving.  By kidnapping a dozen gamers in the middle of the ultimate game, watched by more people than any other sporting event in history, they have thrown down an irresistible gauntlet: to &quot;win&quot; the first game that ever became &quot;real.&quot;  Pursued by armed and murderous terrorists, forced to solve gaming puzzles to stay a jump ahead, forced to juggle multiple psychological realities as they do...this is the game for which  they&#39;ve prepared  their entire lives, and they are going to play it for all it&#39;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
