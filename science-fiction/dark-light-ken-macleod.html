  <title>Dark Light - Ken MacLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Tale of Humans In a Universe of Ubiquitous Alien Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence, it turns out, is rare--on planetary surfaces. It thrives everywhere else, from the Oort-cloud fringes of star systems to the magma furnaces beneath planetary crusts. And among the most powerful of the galaxy&#39;s intelligences, there are profound differences of opinion about how to deal with surface life-forms such as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For, untold light years from Earth, the powers that rule the universe have been, for millennia, plucking humans (and other intelligent beings) from Earth and forcibly resettling them in a number of star systems close to one another, leaving them to develop on their own. A few generations ago, a small cadre of humans from Earth&#39;s 21st century arrived in this &quot;Second Sphere&quot; on their own power--the first humans ever to do so. Their descendants have formed the &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; class that dominates Mingulay. Now, two hundred years later, Gregor Cairns and a small group of associates have rediscovered faster-than-light travel and traveled to the star system next door. They&#39;re determined to find more of the original, mysteriously long-lived cosmonauts. They want answers. And for those answers, they intend to interrogate the gods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
