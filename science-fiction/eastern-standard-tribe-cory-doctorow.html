  <title>Eastern Standard Tribe - Cory Doctorow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Cory Doctorow, a powerful and funny novel about time, tribalism, and a young man&#39;s dismaying discoveries about his own life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scathing, bitter and funny, &lt;i&gt;Eastern Standard Tribe &lt;/i&gt;examines the immutable truths of time, and of societies rebuilt in the storm of instant, ubiquitous communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art is an up-and-coming interface designer, working on the management of data flow along the Massachusetts Turnpike. He&#39;s doing the best work of his career and can guarantee that the system will be, without a question, the most counterintuitive, user-hostile piece of software ever pushed forth onto the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because Art is an industrial saboteur. He may live in London and work for an EU telecommunications megacorp, but Art&#39;s real home is the Eastern Standard Tribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instant wireless communication puts everyone in touch with everyone else, 24 hours a day. But one thing hasn&#39;t changed: the need for sleep. The world is slowly splintering into Tribes held together by a common time zone, less than family and more than nations. Art is working to humiliate the Greenwich Mean Tribe to the benefit of his own people. But in a world without boundaries, nothing can be taken for granted-not happiness, not money, and most certainly not love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which might explain why Art finds himself stranded on the roof of an insane asylum outside Boston, debating whether to push a pencil into his brain....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
