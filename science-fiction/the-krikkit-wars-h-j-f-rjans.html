  <title>The Krikkit Wars - H.J. Förjans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Krikkit is a calm and quiet place. The planet is positioned somewhere in the universe as it is known to us. But the odd thing about this is not that it is an inhabited planet with flourishing intelligent life (which by the way is a lot more common than one might think) but is actually that no one knows about its existence.
Not even, and this is the real mind bender, the inhabitants. This is the story of the Krikkit inhabitants discovering that there are more worlds besides their own in the universe. A universe they did not know existed until the day a small sun crash-landed loudly on a couple of unsuspecting trees. Later they realized that this thing was not a sun but rather a craft of sort. When two Krikkitans used this alien craft to observe the universe from outside their own world for the first time, they discovered an infinite amount of lit candles. At first they could not understand what all those candles were but soon realized that those in fact were distant suns. Having seen this as the first Krikkitans ever, the two pilots looked at each other and said in unison, It will all have to go . . .
