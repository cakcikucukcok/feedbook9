  <title>Ripples - Jeff Burns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Science fiction mystery centering around a one hundred fifty year old lighthouse located on Green Island, just off the North Carolina coast. After being decomissioned and donated to the Green Island Lighthouse Preservation Society, a week long dedication ceremony was held commemorating the lighthouse being put on the National Register of Historic Places. Now, over two years later, the mystery around the lighthouse continues. Mark, a college student in his senior year at UNC Wilmington, is about to be brought into the mystery when he accepts an internship at the Chandler-Langtree Institute, a large government contractor located about fifteen miles from town. Even though his girlfriend, Angela, is not totally thrilled with his new position at the Institute due to numerous rumours about what goes on there, he decides to accept the position anyway. This decision propels him and Angela into circumstances which challenge everything that they&amp;#39;ve always believed to be true. Fearing that Mark may be getting into something which could ultimately prove to be dangerous, Angela goes on a search for the truth about the Chandler-Langtree Institute. What she finds out is beyond anything that she would have ever expected and forces her to question her entire reality. As events begin unfolding at a fast pace on the island, circumstances lead everyone to the lightouse and a series of unbelievable events that will transform her and Mark&amp;#39;s lives, as well as the lives of their families forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
