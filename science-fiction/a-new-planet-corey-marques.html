  <title>A New Planet - Corey Marques</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The characters and plot of this story are fictitious , and although some are
derived from mythical, historical, symbolic and religious means, the story
itself is fictitious. As such, the story is not intended to be taken seriously,
judgmentally, nor religiously; but absorbed and discarded playfully with
an open mind. Take in what you need; take what you feel, discard the rest.
In no way does this book claim to know the right way to grow, because
everyone must walk their own path, everyone must find their own centerpoint
of view . This story comes from one perspective, one eye, one voice,
one soul expressing various elements of human emotion, expression and
opinion. This is a story, with a plot I believe to be of central proportions. It
is up to you to find connections to your own Archetype.
May you always Love your Creator and aim to shine bright like the greatest
role model in the universe. Within creative bright light*Shines great insight.
Aim to be the Author and Master your own world. *Everyone, every soul
has a character, a story that can and does change the World. Ask yourself,
who is your character?" />
