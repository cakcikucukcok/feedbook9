  <title>The Divine Miracle - E. H. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Divine MIracle is a science fiction fantasy partially based on 2 movies and a tv comedy show. The rest of the book comes from the active imagination of the author. The author had ideas for the novel for years but decided to put his ideas on paper after the death of an uncle in 2007. The Divine Miracle has many elements including comedy, drama, action and adventure. This is the first book in a four part series. Tevin Evans is an ordinary 12 year old African-American boy living in Indiana in the year 1983. He attends an predominately white elementary school and he is the only black boy and no girls will really talk to him or even consider being his girlfriend. But that changes when he is struck down and nearly killed by a supernautural event on the playground. Several months later girls everywhere are fighting for his attention after he gains the ability to fly like a bird without wings. His whole body later changes down to the subatomic level and then other boys start coming after him for affection as well as girls. Tevin is confused by all the attention and the changes his body went through but he eventually understands. An youthfull looking adult Tevin living in the late twenty-first century tells the story of how his whole life changed and made him a trans-gendered superhero and gave him superhuman children from his marrage to a man." />
