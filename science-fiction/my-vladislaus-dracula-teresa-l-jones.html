  <title>My Vladislaus Dracula - Teresa L. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the name Dracula is spoken, what image comes into your mind? Do you think of a bloodthirsty monster made up by an Irish story-teller who never stepped foot on Romanian soil?  Or, do you think of a legendary fifteenth century hero of Romania who risked his life and fought courageously to take on the Ottoman empire to protect his land, his people, all of Europe, and all of Christianity?
Since the age of 13, Amelia Justine Kari had a quest. Her quest was to one day take a trip to the beautiful lands of Romania, in search of the truth behind the mysterys of the real Prince Dracula. Once on Romanian soil, Amelia would find other forces already at work in search of her. 
Because of her career choice as a medical technician and her overwhelming fascination with the green eyed, black haired man called Prince Vladislaus Dracula, Amelia was always misunderstood. 
But, what if Vlad Dracula was also misunderstood? What if the pamphlets and documents written about him, were only made up to control him, use his power, and condemn him to prison?  
Amelia was determined to find the truth, but she&#39;d have to search deep in her soul to find all the answers." />
