  <title>Synthesis:Weave - Deane Saunders-Stowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tsunami on a space station. An explosion with no trace of the bomber. Sebastian knows evidence doesn&amp;#39;t magically disappear, yet when he and disabled ex-marine Aryx travel the galaxy to find the cause, there seems to be no other explanation. Can he unravel the mystery before his family, home, and an entire race succumbs to an ancient foe?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tenebrae station served as a pleasant stop-off during long-haul space trips ... until the explosion. With terrorist suspects everywhere, unlikely candidate Sebastian Thorrson - a security programmer promoted into SpecOps - is tasked to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With his friend Aryx, a disabled ex-marine, they don&amp;#39;t seem the most suitable pair, but both are fuelled by a deep-rooted desire for adventure, to see the skies of distant planets and meet with exotic alien species.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An unidentified mineral found at the scene of the explosion forces Sebastian to look further afield for evidence, but his only lead seems to be a hermit living on a comet that insists Sebastian seek out a long-lost colony for his answers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Their only hope for closing the case is to find a mysterious race that uses the mineral to alter the very fabric of reality. Can they give him the answers he seeks - and will the answers he gets bring peace to Tenebrae, or throw everything into turmoil?&lt;/p&gt;" />
