  <title>Fractonia - Pearl R. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All worlds this side of the Beyond Realm face challenges of galactic proportion, but only Fractonia is in a race against time. In an effort to find the key to survival, Fractonia opens its doors to a select few outsiders. To his surprise, Matthew Roberts is invited. By most standards, Matthew is an average kid. What makes him different is his insatiable appetite for adventure. While Matthew grapples with fractions, adventure comes knocking, and Matthew finds himself translated into the Fractonian Realm - the perfect destination for exploration and discovery. From silent beasts to the talkative representative of the Royal Service Extraordinaire, there is no shortage of the bizarre and the wonderful. With so much to captivate Matthew&#39;s attention, it is easy to fall prey to the passing of the yonkinots. Will Matthew be distracted from discovering the real reason that he was invited to this world? The clock is ticking, and time is running out - for Matthew and for Fractonia." />
