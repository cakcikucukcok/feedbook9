  <title>Alienation - S. E. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sally Webber&amp;#39;s dream is coming true: Zander is back and taking her out for a night on the town--on a planet hundreds of light years away from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when an accident separates her from her alien tour guide, she&amp;rsquo;s thrown into the seedy underbelly of an insane city where nothing is as it seems. Suddenly lost and desperate to get back home, Sally is willing to do anything to get out, even if it means accepting spontaneous marriage proposals, crashing some fancy parties, or joining what appears to be the space mob.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All she wanted was some decent interstellar pizza, but now it might be the end of the world as evil nanobots and an out of control AI try to take the universe by force, and the only one who can stop them is missing in action. Sally has no choice but to try to stop them herself--if she can stay alive that long.&lt;/p&gt;" />
