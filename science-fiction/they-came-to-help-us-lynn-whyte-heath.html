  <title>They Came to Help Us - Lynn Whyte-Heath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aged thirty-five, Charlotte had led an idealistic lifestyle under the regime of the Martians who came to Earth to save us from self-destruction in the year 2015.
On the birth of her second daughter Holly, Charlotte began to realize that all was not has it appeared. There had been a price for the help the Martians had given. Was the cost too high?
Having being kept in the dark for thirty-five years, she was now on a mission to complete her education, fighting against her familys advice and her own emotions. Is she endangering herself and others? Does she have the strength to overcome her mental demons? Or will she turn a blind eye and allow them to deceive many mothers without their consent? Just because our (predominantly male) government had made an agreement." />
