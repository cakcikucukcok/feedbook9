  <title>Magic Tales - John L Arnott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From The Depths is the second book in the Magic Tales trilogy from upcoming fantasy writer, John L Arnott. 
        Suspenseful and foreboding right out of the gate, From The Depths is the story of eighth grader, Ryan Tales, a skateboarding phenom, who has just rid himself of the evil book, Papyrus of Adi, and is now trying to get his life back to normal again.
        But what Ryan doesn&#39;t know is that there are forces beyond his control that are forcing him to reunite with the book. The N.S.A. knows about the book and will take any means necessary to get their hands on it. An ancient organization that has been around since the beginning of time called the S.A.S. has been keeping a worldly eye on Ryan and they also want the book.
       What happens though, will change the course of history. The book eventually falls into the hands of an unscrupulous, greedy man, Brock Lohman, who has only one idea in mind.... To take over the world! 
       Grab a front row seat, butter the popcorn and uncover how Ryan and his friends attempt to destroy the powerful Papyrus of Adi, once and for all." />
