Unfortunately, there are secrets yet to be revealed that could threaten their survival.   A mysterious group of people called the Savants appear at the mountain, and Tanis learns of a Gate system called The Hearths which could end the isolation of the Dark Lord and bring destruction to Mt. Drago.  Tanis and Queen Mother must find out how the Dark Lord plans to use these devices and stop him before their world crashes down around them.  Are the Savants friends or foes, and are The Hearths a technology of the future or the end of mankind?
