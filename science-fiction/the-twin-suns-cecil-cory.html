  <title>The Twin Suns - Cecil Cory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ancient technology was discovered in the Kuiper belt. Scientific research teams gathered from Earth, the Federation of Colonies on Mars, and the Lunar Federation of States to study the ancient technology. Karl and Amy Artuso applied and they were chosen from thousands of other applicants for the expedition. With the discovery of the hidden caves on Pluto, the corporation felt that it was within limits to send this family along with others to explore the region. Karl and Amy packed up their four children and told them that they were going on a great journey.   During their research, Karl found and repaired a small maintenance ship. He persuaded the director of operations to allow him test fly the small ship. Amy convinced him to allow her to accompany him on the test flight. The personnel of the research center watched as they darted out into space. Then they suddenly disappeared from the Sol system and entered the Twin Suns system. Little did they know what lay before them would change all of their lives." />
