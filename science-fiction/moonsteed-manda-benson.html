  <title>Moonsteed - Manda Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beasts, #1 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She killed a man who deserved life, and let live a man who deserved death.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Zeta Verity killed a man who deserved to live, and let a man live who deserved death. Now she has a limited amount of time to stop him and bring justice to Callisto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Born to excel but living in the shadow of her auspicious ancestors, Zeta is posted to the newly terraformed Callisto to work with specially bred horses. Killing a spy in possession of stolen data is just another day&#39;s work. She&#39;s not impressed by timid and scholarly Vladimir Bolokhovski, who arrives at the research base with a beautiful stallion he has genetically engineered. But when Zeta&#39;s superiors start disappearing and an arrest warrant is issued on her for spying, she discovers the man she killed is not what he appeared.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once Verity discovers they&#39;re all part of some twisted game, she needs the help of both Vladimir and the dead spy to find and stop the mastermind behind it all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Content warning: Contains horses having sex with horses, humans having sex with humans, and a m&amp;#233;nage a trois between a man, a woman, and the ghost in the machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;61,408 Words" />
