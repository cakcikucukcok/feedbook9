  <title>The Other Side of Midnight : The Prophecy - Author Karen Rivello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Book 1)One prophecy, two families; one moon, two worlds; who will survive?  A curse has spread across the Elvin realm of Waters Edge and only the &#39;chosen one&#39; from the human world can stop it.  One hundred years after the prophecy was foretold, on the night of the harvest moon, the small village celebrates its bountiful year never suspecting that their ancient lore was about to unfold. Though none believed, it could not stop the events from unfolding, and only a few who had been unwillingly drawn in could hope to stop the Elvin prince that had betrayed his own. As the power of the Elvin king wanes, the shadow dragon has also returned to the human world, leaving the pools open for more evil and vile things to pass through, and unless the two worlds pull their armies together, none may survive. How many must perish before the prophecy can be fulfilled" />
