  <title>Dagger’s Hope - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="USA Today Bestseller! New York Times Bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dagger is a Trivator warrior who feared nothing until he met a young, delicate human female who awakened his heart. Her gentle touch, soft voice, and shy sense of humor touch him in a way he never thought could happen. The thought of anything harming someone so beautiful fills him with terror.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jordan Sampson is slowly adjusting to her new life on a strange planet far away from war-torn Earth. She was seventeen when she was brought to the Trivator&amp;rsquo;s home world of Rathon along with her older sister, Jesse, and younger sister, Taylor. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since then, but trying to fit in with an alien society has been&amp;hellip;difficult. There is only one hope that keeps her going: Dagger. He stirs something deep inside her and makes her feel whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Dagger is captured during a mission and sold to the illegal Fight Rings, it is only the memory of Jordan that keeps him going. Time blurs as he slowly sinks deeper and deeper into a world of violence and pain until he becomes more animal than Trivator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jordan knows Dagger is out there, somewhere, and she cannot stop until she finds him. The fight to save Dagger takes Jordan on a journey that she hopes they both survive. The star system is a dangerous place for a young human female and a damaged Trivator warrior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of adventure and romance. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid landscapes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
