  <title>Creedor: Part 1 of The Reglon Empire Series - Gail Morgan McRae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;first book in the Reglon Empire Series&amp;nbsp;chronicles the adventures of Dr. Simon Slogar and Commander Michael Camdus as they try to stop an epidemic that is killing Creedorians by the thousands. When they finally get there, they discover that there is a far greater threat but are left to their own devices for handling it. Repeated requests to their Emperor, a man named Jarlod, get no response. Once on Creedor, Dr. Slogar and his assistant Lieutenant Jacar Grunden must make their way through a wind storm across the shifting sand dunes to a small cottage they hope to use for shelter. When they arrive, they meet Mara Tonlin who has lost her child and now cannot locate her husband, Ram Tonlin. She alternates between panic and despair before her gritty determination to find Ram, no matter the risks, kicks in. With Commander Camdus&amp;#39; permission, Grunden and Mara set out through the storm, leaving Dr. Slogar alone&amp;nbsp;to wait for an escort to Clandil. When Grunden and Mara finally reach shelter, their relief is short-lived. The howling, frigid wind and rocky cave floor make sleep difficult. But they finally drift off. But during&amp;nbsp;the night,&amp;nbsp;they wake up, stiff and cold. The cover Grunden placed over the entrance has been blown over, letting the icy air rush in. Grunden steps out only to be greeted by the ghost of his buddy Zander, who tells him to go back inside. Assuming the mischievous Zander knocked over the cover, Grunden is miffed. But when a quicksilver movement catches his eye, he hurries back in only to find Mara gone. Now Commander Camdus has to delay his original mission so he can find Grunden and bring him home - with or without the woman. Meanwhile, Grunden takes to the tunnels to look for Mara. He realizes he&amp;#39;s not alone, but moves on as quickly as he&amp;#39;s able through the sometimes narrow, always rocky passages. Though captured herself, Mara&amp;#39;s concern is for her husband. She has no way of knowing that he is alive, though living in extremely difficult circumstances, the plaything of a wicked creature. When he is able to move about the enclave where he&amp;rsquo;s being held prisoner, he returns to the slave cell and finds it unguarded. His old friend Stadar is still&amp;nbsp;alive, but only barely. Without a second thought, Ram scoops him up and races into the blinding storm, stumbling into a miracle bush that lets them enter. While inside the bush, Stadar and Ram both recover their strength and head back inside. When Ram and Stadar are in the tunnels, they bump into Grunden and follow him. Ram sees Mara&amp;#39;s limp arm hanging over the side of an altar. Just then he hears a bloodcurdling scream coming from one of the tunnels. They watch as a giant cat leaps up onto the pedestal with her. Just as the beast is ready to devour her, a whistle from below calls him away. Ram takes this opportunity, rushes in, and grabs her. They all take off back to the miracle bush. Mara slowly wakes up, but they have to rely on Commander Camdus to retrieve them from the storm. While there, they discover an illegal mining facility, Q&amp;#39;Door Hold, that the Q&amp;#39;Arons have established. This ancient enemy scores a blow by stealing massive amounts of the mineral trizactl, but the Reglons vow to make them pay. This decision moves these characters into the second book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hellritch,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;where they learn what evil looks like. But Camdus has already discovered who he really is and is convinced he is ready for the task.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;If it were only that simple....&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The Reglons run into even greater problems in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hellritch&lt;/em&gt;, that leads them to their greatest adventure yet, in the third book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dunmyrr.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
