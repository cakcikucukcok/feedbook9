In such an enlightened Forest, there can be no such thing as the past, for everyone in the past was evil, except the sheep, who are so inhuman they are gods and priests. Because the future is present, there is no future. With future and past not existing, the present is all but an idea of the old skyview.

It would be wrong to discuss how the Martians were once natural original form humans, who were then participants in state-mandated genetic engineering. The story of the anti-colonial Martians colonizing Earth is irrelevant to the chanceselling bodies in the Forest. Thinking it&amp;rsquo;s e-ehkay to talk about humans, as if they&amp;rsquo;re real, is racist, sick and gross. It&amp;rsquo;s disgusting. Who has ever seen a real human?

That&amp;rsquo;s a banned word. No one in the Forest is a citizen when everyone is a parapatetic voyager. Except if you was born here, then you is privileged and better act right around the sheep. They ain&amp;rsquo;t privileged and can do as they please, by golly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utopia is a place of freedom, equali-tay and securi-tay. It&amp;rsquo;s a place of love, inclusion, and acceptance. But please if you don&amp;rsquo;t act like a citizen, which is a banned word, the Micro-Ministry will send you to a place with all the other bigots and astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ain&amp;rsquo;t no room for space racists in these here parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the gods deciding who the gods and animals are, can do as they please. We believe in caring, inclusion and equali-tay. The Alt-Human Fluidity Spectrum Scale will equally decide who is animal and who is god.
