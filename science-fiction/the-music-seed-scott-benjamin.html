  <title>The Music Seed - Scott Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A 14 year old girl with extreme musical talent is dying of cancer. Her father (a special government agent), a strange visitor from another planet simply calling himself the Music Man and four powerful beings who accompany him converge on Earth to thwart a pending attack in our future.
But can they do it in time?
Who can be trusted? 
Will the young girl realize her destiny in time before she dies?
What will happen to Earth if she fails? 
Why is all this related to only music?
What did a fifth airplane on 9/11 have to do with the young girl?
The Music Man has been sent to Earth by four special beings. But why was he sent here and what does he know about Earth? How can a 14-year-old girl save our planet? 
A genius inventor, a radical doctor and a NASA video surveillance specialist all become part of the now complex countdown.
And we just have a little over 677 years to become prepared for the inevitable." />
