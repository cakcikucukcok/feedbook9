  <title>End of Days - Robert Gleason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born from the fear of nuclear annihilation and painstakingly researched for over twenty years, Robert Gleason&#39;s &lt;i&gt;End of Days&lt;/i&gt; is a thriller unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lydia Lozen Magruder--the great-granddaughter of a female Apache war-shaman--has seen visions of the End since childhood. She has constructed a massive ranch-fortress in the American Southwest, stocked with everything necessary to rebuild civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now her visions are coming true. John Stone, once a baseball star and now a famous gonzo journalist, stumbled across a plan to blast humanity back to the stone age. Then he vanished. Lydia&#39;s only hope of tracking him down lies with her stubborn, globe-trotting daughter, Kate, Stone&#39;s former lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate is about to step right into the plotters&#39; crosshairs. Stone has been captured by a pair of twin Middle Eastern princesses, hell-bent on torturing him until he reveals all he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a Russian general obsessed with nuclear Armageddon has also disappeared...as have eight or more of his Russian subs, armed with nuclear-tipped missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is armed for self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will survive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
