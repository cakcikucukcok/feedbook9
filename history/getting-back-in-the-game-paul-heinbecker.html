  <title>Getting Back in the Game - Paul Heinbecker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul Heinbecker has a compelling vision for the future of Canadian foreign policy and argues that Canada still has a role to play in the rehabilitation of global governance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has Canada lost its place in the world? Are we destined for a future as a middle power, denied a seat at the &quot;grown-ups table&quot;? Some would argue yes, that decades of neglect and inattention have rendered Canadian foreign policy ineffective at best and non-existent at worst. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paul Heinbecker disagrees. The golden days of Lester B. Pearson may be long gone, he contends (and perhaps they weren’t quite as &quot;golden&quot; as we’d all like to remember), but Canada still has a part to play. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Getting Back in the Game&lt;/i&gt;, Heinbecker presents his compelling vision for the future of Canadian foreign policy, a future in which Canada can work both with the United Nations and apart from it; in which our government can take a stand and effect change on issues of the day from climate change to the Middle East; in which this country has a key role to play in the rehabilitation of global governance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
