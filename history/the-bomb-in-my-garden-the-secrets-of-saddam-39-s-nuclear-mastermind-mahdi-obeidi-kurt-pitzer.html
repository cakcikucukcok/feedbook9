  <title>The Bomb in My Garden: The Secrets of Saddam&#39;s Nuclear Mastermind - Mahdi Obeidi, Kurt Pitzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acclaim for the Bomb in My Garden&quot;This one book will tell you more about Iraq&#39;s quest for weapons of mass destruction than all U.S. intelligence on the subject. It is a fascinating and rare glimpse inside Saddam Hussein&#39;s Iraq&amp;#151;and inside a tyrant&#39;s mind.&quot;&amp;#151;Fareed Zakaria, author of The Future of Freedom&quot;The Bomb in My Garden is important and utterly gripping. The old clich&amp;#233; is true&amp;#151;you start reading, and you don&#39;t want to stop. Mahdi Obeidi&#39;s story makes clear how hard Saddam Hussein tried to develop a nuclear weapon, and the reasons he fell short. It is also unforgettable as a picture of how honorable people tried to cope with a despot&#39;s demands. I enthusiastically recommend this book.&quot;&amp;#151;James Fallows, National Correspondent, The Atlantic Monthly&quot;One of the three or four accounts that anyone remotely interested in the Iraq debate will simply have to read. Apart from its insight into the workings of the Saddam nuclear project, it provides a haunting account of the atmosphere of sheer evil that permeated every crevice of Iraqi life under the old regime.&quot;&amp;#151;christopher hitchens, Slate&quot;Mahdi Obeidi describes in jaw-dropping detail how Iraq acquired the means to produce highly enriched uranium, the key  ingredient to building a nuclear weapon, by the eve of the first Gulf War. . . . [His book] offers insights into how a determined dictator, backed by sufficient resources, can come within reach of acquiring the world&#39;s most horrific weapons.&quot;&amp;#151;The Washington Post BookWorld" />
