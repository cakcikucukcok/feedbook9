  <title>The Wind God - Mary Jo Birrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abandonment, bigamy, crib deaths, single mothers struggling to raise families - these are not new age phenomena. Mollie Tidwell knew them all as well as she knew her own family. But how well was that? &lt;br /&gt;
In the late 1800s these truths were swept under the parlor rug. &lt;br /&gt;
Mollie Tidwell was born near Springfield, Illinois, an only child. When she was four her mother died and she was given away to the Indians. &lt;br /&gt;
In summary this sounds a fearful thing but in reality it was Mollies rebirth. Surrounded by love she became a young women of promise whose only goal was to marry and find security and love in her own home. &lt;br /&gt;
She came the full circle in adjusting to her different lives: from the white society; to Indian; to quarter-blood; to white. But, the Cherokee Indian teachings were the lasting influences for her. &lt;br /&gt;
The story finally had to be written when a relative shared a memory that Mollie had told of her Grandfather who would ride a tall white horse to the edge of the Tidwell property for a secret visit. He would bring her an apple for a treat. &lt;br /&gt;
The theme of this story? Mollies family became her possessions. When death tried to take them away she would not let them go. What she had to learn was that your children were a gift to be returned to God. Before she died she realized that she must forgive them for dying and release their earth bound spirits. It was a race against time for her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
