  <title>Silent Darkness - Allen E. Wiesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In what appears to be an accident, a military transport making its approach to a small civilian airstrip plummets abruptly from the sky. The official Air Force report reveals that a brief disruption in the airports electrical power had occurred just before the crash. The sudden loss of runway lighting, the investigation concludes, caused the pilot to lose his bearings.
It was a no brainer. Case closed!
Or was it?
If it had been that simple, why were the alarms resonating in the compulsive brain of Noel Parke, New York regional director of the Department of Homeland Protection?
As Parke and his long-term associate Hiram Willoughby dig deeper into the events immediately preceding the crash, they begin to discover an inconsistency here and a contradiction there. Suddenly their growing suspicions gain new life as Dr. Natalie Bernard, top scientist at the Energy Warfare Complex, arrives on the scene with a shocking revelation. What had brought down the plane, she is convinced, was not the darkened runway, but an intense beam of microwave energy from an ultra-advanced weapon that she herself had designed for the Air Force. Someone, probably on her own research team, had stolen her blueprints and replicated the prototype. And now the most sophisticated weapon on the planet was in the wrong hands.
In Times Square, the lights begin to flicker. But dont worry, its just a warning. The Electrician wants tons of money, or hell shut off the lights everywhere for years at a time. Noel Parke must find a way to stop him before the city plunges into a silent darkness from which it may never recover.
Silent Darkness is not science fiction. It is a warning of what lies at the corner of today and tomorrow." />
