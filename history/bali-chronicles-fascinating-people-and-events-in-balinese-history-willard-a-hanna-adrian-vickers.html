  <title>Bali Chronicles: Fascinating People and Events in Balinese History - Willard A. Hanna, Adrian Vickers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This book tells the story of Bali&amp;#151;the &quot;paradise island of the Pacific&quot;&amp;#151;its rulers and its people, and their encounters with the Western world.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Balinese history tells a fascinating story.  For a thousand years, the peculiar splendor of Balinese&amp;#150;Hindu culture came very close to satisfying the social, religious and artistic needs of the people.  The arrival of European visitors in the 1920s and 1930s soon made the island&#39;s magical charms known to the outside world, and forever changed the &quot;real, unspoiled&quot; Bali.  This is the story about the vulnerability&amp;#151;and durability&amp;#151;of an ancient culture to the modern world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There already exists a wealth of literature on Balinese art and thought and the singularly beautiful Balinese way of life which often seems to outsiders like a lavishly costumed pageant continuously and merrily played out against a superbly scenic tropical backdrop.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A new introduction by Adrian Vickers, a professor of history at the University of Sydney, places the book into the context of the literature on Bali and the impact that the Western world and tourism are currently having on the island.&lt;/div&gt;" />
