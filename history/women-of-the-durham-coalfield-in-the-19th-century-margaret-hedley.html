  <title>Women of the Durham Coalfield in the 19th Century - Margaret Hedley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The  success  of  the  Durham Coalfield  and  its  important  role  in  the  Industrial  Revolution is attributed to men of influence who owned the land and the pits,  and men who worked in the coal-mining industry during the Victorian period. There  has  been  very  little  written  about the importance  of  the  home  life that supported  the  miners – their  wives who through  heroic  efforts, did their best  to provide attractive, healthy, happy  homes for  her  husband,  in  appalling  social conditions.
To   provide   such   a   welcoming   atmosphere   at   home   demanded tremendous resources and commitment from the miners’ wives. Despite  their  many  hardships  these  women  put  everyone  in  the  family  before  themselves – they were selfless.  They operated on less rest, less food at times of  necessity and under a huge physical burden of work and emotional burden of worry concerning the safety of her husband at the pit and the mortality of her children. 
This book addresses the lack of information about women&#39;s role at the Durham coalfield, engagingly explored through one woman&#39;s experience." />
