  <title>I Am, the Father of the Nation - Sabita Paintal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Should we wait for another Mahatma Gandhi to be born and guide the nation to the right track to follow, or should we develop our mental ability to understand his ideology and create harmony in the world? I am in favor of the second option, but the decision is personal.
I have visited many places in India and visualized that there is an urgent need to reopen the pages of the history of the independence of India as the new generation has lost track. There is a need to reawake the people with the sacrifices of our great revolutionary leaders. Among them, the priority is on one name, that is Gandhiji, the Father of the Nation, and if the people are ignorant and innocent about his sacrifices for his country, then I feel that we should not to be humiliated but should revive his whole ideology in a simple form for the common people and others to understand it thoroughly. It is a matter of pride that Gandhiji became successful with his firm and fearless attitudes, cooperation of the masses, and with his ideology of nonviolence and truthfulness, which was highly praised throughout the world.
I am, The Father Of The Nation is a book to provide us strength for fearless attitudes, firmness toward our hidden qualities, appreciation toward truthfulness, love for our country, praises for our own culture, positive attitude toward humanity, and above all, the right decisions at the right time. All the chapters in the novel cover the above statements positively and proved that there is no need to wait for another Gandhi to be born again if we are on the track of Mahatma Gandhis ideology.
I have elaborated each chapter of the novel with the theories of Gandhiji and related it with the stories of the common people. By this hope that not only will people find the book interesting but it will leave an everlasting impact on the personalities of the readers." />
