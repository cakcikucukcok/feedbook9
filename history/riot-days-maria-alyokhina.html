  <title>Riot Days - Maria Alyokhina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Pussy Rioter&#39;s riveting, hallucinatory account of her years in Russia&#39;s criminal system and of finding power in the most powerless of situations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, after smuggling an electric guitar into Moscow&#39;s iconic central cathedral, Maria Alyokhina and other members of the radical collective Pussy Riot performed a provocative &quot;Punk Prayer,&quot; taking on the Orthodox church and its support for Vladimir Putin&#39;s authoritarian regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, they were charged with &quot;organized hooliganism&quot; and were tried while confined in a cage and guarded by Rottweilers. That trial and Alyokhina&#39;s subsequent imprisonment became an international cause. For Alyokhina, her two-year sentence launched a bitter struggle against the Russian prison system and an iron-willed refusal to be deprived of her humanity. Teeming with protests and police, witnesses and cellmates, informers and interrogators, &lt;i&gt;Riot Days&lt;/i&gt; gives voice to Alyokhina&#39;s insistence on the right to say no, whether to a prison guard or to the president. Ultimately, this insistence delivers unprecedented victories for prisoners&#39; rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evocative, wry, laser-sharp, and laconically funny, Alyokhina&#39;s account is studded with song lyrics, legal transcripts, and excerpts from her jail diary--dispatches from a young woman who has faced tyranny and returned with the proof that against all odds even one person can force its retreat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
