  <title>The Icarus Syndrome: A History of American Hubris - Peter Beinart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Peter Beinart has written a vivid, empathetic, and convincing history of the men and ideas that have shaped the ambitions of American foreign policy during the last century&amp;#8212;a story in which human fallibility and idealism flow together. The story continues, of course, and so his book is not only timely; it is indispensable.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; Steve Coll, author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Beinart&#39;s provocative account of hubris in the American century describes Washington on the eve of three wars: World War I, Vietnam, and Iraq&amp;#8212;three moments when American leaders decided they could remake the world in their image. Each time, leading intellectuals declared that the spread of democracy was inevitable. Each time, a president held the nation in the palm of his hand. And each time, a war conceived in arrogance brought tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each catastrophe also imparted wisdom to a new generation of thinkers. These leaders learned to reconcile the American belief that anything is possible with the realities of a world that will never fully conform to this country&#39;s will&amp;#8212;and in their struggles lie the seeds of American renewal today. &lt;/p&gt;" />
