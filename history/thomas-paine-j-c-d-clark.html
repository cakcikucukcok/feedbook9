  <title>Thomas Paine - J. C. D. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Paine (1737-1809) was England&#39;s greatest revolutionary: no other reformer was as actively involved in events of the scale of the American and French Revolutions, and none wrote such best-selling texts with the impact of Common Sense and Rights of Man. No one else combined the roles of activist and theorist, or did so in the &#39;age of revolutions&#39;, fundamental as it was to the emergence of the &#39;modern world&#39;. But his fame meant that he was taken
up and reinterpreted for current use by successive later commentators and politicians, so that the &#39;historic Paine&#39; was too often obscured by the &#39;usable Paine&#39;.
J. C. D. Clark explains Paine against a revised background of early- and mid-eighteenth-century England. He argues that Paine knew and learned less about events in America and France than was once thought. He de-attributes a number of publications, and passages, hitherto assumed to have been Paine&#39;s own, and detaches him from a number of causes (including anti-slavery, women&#39;s emancipation, and class action) with which he was once associated. Paine&#39;s formerly obvious association with the early
origin and long-term triumph of natural rights, republicanism, and democracy needs to be rethought. As a result, Professor Clark offers a picture of radical and reforming movements as more indebted to the initiatives of large numbers of men and women in fast-evolving situations than to the writings
of a few individuals who framed lasting, and eventually triumphant, political discourses." />
