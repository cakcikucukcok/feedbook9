      <meta name="description" content="The Loch Sloy was built for Aitken, Lilburn &amp; Co of Glasgow. She sailed between Britain and Australia for more than twenty years. In that time she established a reputation as a crack wool clipper. Windjammer, the story of the clipper ship Loch Sloy is not an adventure nor is it a romance or a tragedy, even though it contains elements of all three.The ship, her captains, officers, crew and passengers, all those her sailed upon her call out from the past to have their stories told. The Loch Sloy&#39;s&#39; keel was laid down in mid-1877. By August the construction of the hull and deck fittings had been completed. After her first marine survey, the masts were stepped in, and by the end of October the Loch Sloy was all but complete. The clipper lasted twenty one years before coming to grief on the jagged shore of Kangaroo Island during the predawn hours of April 24th 1899. The final chapter of the Loch Sloy like her unfortunate passengers and crew was buried beneath the ever shifting sands of Maupertuis Bay." />
