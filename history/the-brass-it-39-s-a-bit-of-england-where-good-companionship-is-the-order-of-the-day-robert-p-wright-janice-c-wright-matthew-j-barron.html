  <title>The Brass: It&#39;s a bit of England where good companionship is the order of the day - Robert P. Wright, Janice C. Wright, Matthew J. Barron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Brass is the story of the birth and growth of a world-famous public house, the Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon. This authentic pub, with deep British roots, became the cathedral of Oregon&#39;s craft beer revolution and its publican, Don Younger, the archbishop. It is a warm place with real British soul where good companionship is the order of the day and the best beer on earth welcomes everyone. This pub has been twinned for nearly three decades with the Prince of Wales, an historic London pub near Wimbledon.       This book is a journey through time with people from two countries, primarily a summary of the individual oral histories of the principals, supplemented by research. It is a narrative of this celebrated pub&#39;s events and people, their history, their character and their motivation; they are the soul of the pub. The Brass is based on the interviews of others who were involved with the pub over decades, to the best that their memories recalled. (&quot;Accuracy in the reporting of historical information by a bunch of drinkers after 20+ years cannot and should not be expected,&quot; comment from an interviewed, longtime regular.)" />
