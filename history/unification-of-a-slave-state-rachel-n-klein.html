  <title>Unification of a Slave State - Rachel N. Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book describes the turbulent transformation of South Carolina from a colony rent by sectional conflict into a state dominated by the South&#39;s most unified and politically powerful planter leadership.  Rachel Klein unravels the sources of conflict and growing unity, showing how a deep commitment to slavery enabled leaders from both low- and backcountry to define the terms of political and ideological compromise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spread of cotton into the backcountry, often invoked as the reason for South Carolina&#39;s political unification, actually concluded a complex struggle for power and legitimacy.  Beginning with the Regulator Uprising of the 1760s, Klein demonstrates how backcountry leaders both gained authority among yeoman constituents and assumed a powerful role within state government.  By defining slavery as the natural extension of familial inequality, backcountry ministers strengthened the planter class.  At the same time, evangelical religion, like the backcountry&#39;s dominant political language, expressed yet contained the persisting tensions between planters and yeomen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klein weaves social, political, and religious history into a formidable account of planter class formation and southern frontier development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
