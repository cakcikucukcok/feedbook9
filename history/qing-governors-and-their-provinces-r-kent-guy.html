  <title>Qing Governors and Their Provinces - R. Kent Guy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;During the Qing dynasty (1644&amp;#65533;1911), the province emerged as an important element in the management of the expanding Chinese empire, with governors -- those in charge of these increasingly influential administrative units -- playing key roles. R. Kent Guy&amp;#65533;s comprehensive study of this shift concentrates on the governorship system during the reigns of the Shunzhi, Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong emperors, who ruled China from 1644 to 1796.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the preceding Ming dynasty (1368&amp;#65533;1644), the responsibilities of provincial officials were ill-defined and often shifting; Qing governors, in contrast, were influential members of a formal administrative hierarchy and enjoyed the support of the central government, including access to resources. These increasingly powerful officials extended the court&amp;#65533;s influence into even the most distant territories of the Qing empire.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both masters of the routine processes of administration and troubleshooters for the central government, Qing governors were economic and political administrators who played crucial roles in the management of a larger and more complex empire than the Chinese had ever known. Administrative concerns varied from region to region: Henan was dominated by the great Yellow River, which flowed through the province; the Shandong governor dealt with the exchange of goods, ideas, and officials along the Grand Canal; in Zhili, relations between civilians and bannermen in the strategically significant coastal plain were key; and in northwestern Shanxi, governors dealt with border issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Qing Governors and Their Provinces uses the records of governors&amp;#65533; appointments and the laws and practices that shaped them to reconstruct the development of the office of provincial governor and to examine the histories of governors&amp;#65533; appointments in each province. Interwoven throughout is colorful detail drawn from the governors&amp;#65533; biographies.&lt;/P&gt;" />
