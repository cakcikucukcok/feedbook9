  <title>Writings of an American Mother in 2010:  Principles of the Founding Fathers and Current Issues - Mary E. Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As I progressed on my leadership training through Lamp: The Institute for Leadership in Physical Therapy, . . . I ran into some resistance in completing my I ILP project . . . there must be something about leadership that I was not getting. So, I went to my plan B. What Leader or Leaders would I like to have dinner with and get into their brains and hearts? Humm. . . . the Founding Fathers of the United States of America . . . for they created a new unique government! Dr. W. Cleon Skousen published The Five Thousand Year leap: A Miracle That Changed the World. This book is easy to read and brought the confusion of politics into clear focus. Dr. Skousen said many times that the Founder&#39;s success formula would solve nearly every problem we have in America today. Really? Can any knowledge be more helpful to the rising generation of Leaders in America? The purpose of my book, The Writings of an American Mother in 2010 . . . is to encourage people to review our past, our history as a country, the 28 Principles of our Founding Fathers and how they relate to current issues. . . . then develop your own viewpoint through critical thinking and doing your own homework . . . becoming an Active American Citizen!
