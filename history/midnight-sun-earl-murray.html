  <title>Midnight Sun - Earl Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the song,&lt;i&gt; Hotel California&lt;/i&gt;, right? &quot;You can check out any time you like but you can never leave.&quot; Sure, it&#39;s a great song, but the Eagles had it wrong: The hotel referred to in the Eagles hit song isn&#39;t in California. It&#39;s in Nevada, and Earl Murray has a story about this hotel so chilling, you won&#39;t be able to hear this song again without breaking a sweat and looking back over your shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hotel California and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt; is the second book in Earl Murray&#39;s acclaimed Ghosts of the Old West series. This time, Earl retells the story passed along to him by Shirley Porter and her husband about buying an old hotel in Nevada, and like the song suggests, were unable to leave. Shirley&#39;s story is one of unexplained dreams and fears and odd feelings, a series of encounters with disembodied spirits locked in time, unable to escape the hotel, and determined to keep Shirley and her husband trapped with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other stories include the experience of two women visiting the Big Hole Battlefield site in western Montana; that day, they witnesses hundreds of red-tailed hawks peculiarly hovering just above ground; wilderness sightings of Bigfoot and Ghosts Lights, and animal spirits that have come to visit, or merely pass in the night before unsuspecting onlookers; Skinwalker stories from the American Southwest; and the ongoing mystery of cattle mutilations in the wide open spaces of the West, a vast territory of untold secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
