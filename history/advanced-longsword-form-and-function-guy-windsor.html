  <title>Advanced Longsword: Form and Function - Guy Windsor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book builds on the foundation laid in  The Medieval Longsword, and teaches you how to train Fiore dei Liberi&#39;s Art of Arms, as shown in his 1410 manuscript ll Fior di Battaglia. Renowned swordsman and author Guy Windsor explains three of the longsword forms that are used every day in  The School of European Swordsmanship: •  The Cutting Drill •  The Farfalla di Ferro •  THe Longsword Syllabus Form. Each form is explained step by step and application by application, with abundant photographs and images from Fiore&#39;s manuscript. Guy takes you through each step first as a pair drill, then as part of the form, then as a starting point for further training, or for further research into Il Fior di Battaglia. Within these pages you will find in-depth instructions and analysis, dozens of tips for how to improve your skills, and enough material for years of study. Guy Windsor has been training martial arts for 30 years, and teaching professionally since he founded  The School of European Swordsmanship in 2001. The School has branches and study groups all over the world. Guy&#39;s other books include  The Swordsman&#39;s Companion,  The Duellist&#39;s Companion, Veni Vadi Vici, Mastering the Art of Arms volume 1:  The Medieval Dagger, and Mastering the Art of Arms volume 2:  The Medieval Longsword.
