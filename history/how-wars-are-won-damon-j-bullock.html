  <title>How Wars Are Won - Damon J. Bullock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book came into being because of an intrinsic desire to educate others on how the U.S. military has maintained its position as the worlds premier fighting force. This careful explanation will be achieved by using the structural functionalism approach as the sociological foundation and its relationship with the various social actors. This approach reinforces the fact that team unity and cohesion can only result when various social actors work together for the common good of the mission. I want readers to not only understand the military as a fighting force but also how the military is subject to social influences like any other social institution. The U.S. military is often studied regarding its role in our society as a mechanism of protection without much emphasis as a social institution with actors or individuals who are subject to the influences of social interaction like a fallen apple is subject to the Law of Gravity. Writing this book on the subject of military sociology was also inspired because of my unique position in the U.S. Army. As a military sociologist and company grade officer, I have the practical experience and educational background to talk about the social facts that sustain troop cohesion, support, and morale. Mechanisms are established in the military to encourage individuals who are different in many regards to think and fight as one team. The United States military is only great because we have great family, friends, and comrades that support us as individuals and as the American military." />
