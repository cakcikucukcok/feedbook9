  <title>George, Elise and a mandarin - Terry Fewtrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emigration to Australia in the 1870s was a journey into the unknown. What lay ahead and the social and political contexts that confronted immigrants were just part of the uncertainty.&amp;nbsp;George and Elise Fewtrell were two such immigrants. From separate lands, Shropshire and Schleswig-Holstein, they brought to colonial Queensland different cultures and senses of identity. George, a British man who came to do the Empire&amp;rsquo;s work; Elise from a war-torn home where identity was more fragile and nuanced.&amp;nbsp;Each endured tragedy but ultimately they shared a life together, working to create the community of Palmwoods, raise a family of young Australians and develop a citrus orchard and the Fewtrell&amp;rsquo;s Early mandarin, that continues to enhance the nutrition of millions in India and Pakistan.&amp;nbsp;A compelling story of Australian lives, told in the context of their times. Archetypes of Australia&amp;rsquo;s British and multi-cultural identities. Ordinary lives &amp;ndash; extraordinary social history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Terry Fewtrell&amp;rsquo;s clear-eyed and sensitive portrait of George and Elise places immigration at the heart of the Australian story. They are one and all: enterprising emigrants from the Old World, dispossessors and nation makers. Their story is one that touches every aspect of Australian history. Written with a deep love of both family and country, Fewtrell has succeeded in making his own family&amp;rsquo;s history universal.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Mark McKenna, historian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;This wonderful book goes well beyond the standard family history, providing us with fresh perspectives on Australia&amp;rsquo;s contested frontier and multicultural past. It is also intimate history, deftly connecting an earlier Australia to the present. Fewtrell as a writer is at once lucid, trenchant and, when required, scholarly. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put this one down.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Dr David Headon, historian, Visiting Fellow, ANU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip;one of the best family histories I have read&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Noeline Kyle, family story specialist, author of&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;How to write and publish your family story in 10 easy steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Terry Fewtrell has produced a very lucid piece of social history. His book is grounded in a keen understanding of the milieu of his family, yet at all times, Fewtrell maintains a clear and engaging manner.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Dr Ray Kerkhove, historian&lt;/p&gt;" />
