  <title>Marblehead - Ron Stock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written based on the events of his great grandparents life in the dawn of the 20th century, Marbleheads a classic story with a classic hero  one mans selfless journey through rural America, with a supportive caste in tow and a bottle of the divine in hand. 
As a natural born storyteller with an eye for the smooth weave of a good plot, Ron Stocks prose pulls us through page after page, casting glimpses of the extents to which hope can carry us. Driven solely by purpose, everyman hero Gay Billings carries us from a well-worn, dirt-caked farm life, to the bustling industry of the big city. With a graceful hand, Ron Stock delivers troves of memorable characters, and chocks them full of spirit. Some struggle with values, and others pivot on a dime, but each one carries a unique essence, all their own.  
With the knack for unpredictability and a taste for good humor, Ron Stocks delivered his most layered title, to date. If youre in the mood for that down-home feel with a touch of the sublime, Marblehead is sure to please.
