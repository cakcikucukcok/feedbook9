  <title>Two Hours that Shook the World - Fred Halliday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the dust settled around the devastation of the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001, a host of questions emerged surrounding the attacks, the motives behind them and their future implications. In Two Hours that Shook the World Fred Halliday expands on the many socio-cultural, religious and political problems that have plagued the Middle East and Central Asia in the last half-century. Much has been written about &#39;global terrorism&#39; and the need to eliminate it but also about the divide between East and West, the &#39;clash of civilisations&#39;. Halliday dispels the idea that the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds are poised for conflict. He explains the causes and rise of Islamic fundamentalism, how terror became an instrument of political and military conflict, and why seemingly well-educated and sane individuals are taking drastic actions to voice their desperation. The burden of history is also invoked, as with the Palestinian-Israeli situation, the festering malaise at the heart of Middle Eastern consciousness and identity. While Halliday&#39;s book examines the causes of what has happened, it also provides a reasoned approach as to what the future may hold. &#39;By far the best book on the catastrophe of 11 September.&#39; The Observer &#39;Cuts the proverbial ice.&#39; The Daily Star &#39;Sober and balanced.&#39; John Gray, New Statesman &#39;To understand 11 September we need a broader context and Halliday is up to the task ... He reveals his true calibre.&#39; Ziauddin Sardar, Independent" />
