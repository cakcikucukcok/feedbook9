  <title>The Prophet of Islam in History - Shahid Ahmad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is an irony that despite having a plethora of biographical and historical works on the life of the Prophet of Islam, it is difficult to understand his true historical personality. He never claimed to possess any superhuman qualities, and the Quran also reiterated that he was only a human being. Over the course of centuries, however, the hagiographical writings of Islamic historians almost amounted to his deification. And in modern times, when Western historians started sketching his historical biography, the pendulum swung to the other extreme. In complete disregard of his religious personality, they viewed his life in purely mundane terms, depicting him as a worldly character amenable to the vices of the time. 
As a true historical sketch of his life has therefore become blurred in biographical works of both categorieshagiographical accounts by the Muslim writers and motivated historiography by the OrientalistsThe Prophet of Islam in History evaluates historical writings about the Prophet by both types of writers, and it presents a total and unbiased history of his life in a systematic and chronologically acceptable manner. With different events of his life integrated in their true historical contexts, it presents a gradual evolution of his religious as well as political personality. 
Since the life of Muhammad is the key to understanding Islam amid its current aberrations as well as misrepresentations, the subject assumes great importance in the quest to know what the founder of Islam actually preached." />
