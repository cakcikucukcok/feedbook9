  <title>Behind the Doors of Notorious Covent Garden - Elizabeth Sharland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Covent Garden, the cultural heart of London, is notorious for its history, ghosts, and the Old Market. Discover the special places unique to this area.  &lt;p&gt;
It would be interesting to read about the latest fashionable shops, popular pubs and hotels that existed in Covent Garden a hundred years ago but there is no accurate record as far as I know.&lt;p&gt;
 This book, therefore, may be of interest in 100 years hence when we are all gone. There are biographies of the people who lived and worked here of course, and some of the restaurants and theatres they visited are still in existence, but in 100 years time, they may be all gone, too.&lt;p&gt;
While doing research for this book I came across the writings of theatre people, who had lived and worked in Covent Garden, when I was a student, and who had inspired me,  although they were a little before my time. They have a chapter in this book. Clemence Dane, (Winifred Ashton) Alan Dent, Angus McBean, James Agate all wrote about the area and their stories make fascinating reading." />
