  <title>The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism - Bertrand Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism&lt;/i&gt; is Bertrand Russell&amp;#39;s critique of the Communist system he witnessed in the Soviet Union. Russell, a proponent of Communist ideals, believed that the future happiness of humanity depended upon restructuring the way production and business was run. The Bolsheviks, however, pursued their goals with an iron fist rather than with a free and idealistic hope that nurtured the individual. Russell was also staunchly opposed to the way that Bolshevism saw itself as a religion, with practices and beliefs that could brook no doubt. This, he determined, was no better than the Catholic Church, which he opposed. Anyone with an interest in Communism and the Soviet Union will find this a deeply thoughtful book." />
