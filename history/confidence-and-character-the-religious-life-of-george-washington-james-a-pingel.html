  <title>Confidence and Character: The Religious Life of George Washington - James A. Pingel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His birthday was once celebrated as a national holiday and his portrait once adorned the walls of almost every classroom in the United States. He was a victorious Revolutionary War general, a crucial influence in the creation of the Constitution, and the first President of the United States. Today, unfortunately, many only know America&#39;s first hero and the &quot;Father of His Country&quot; as a slaveholder with wooden teeth or as the somber-looking man on the one-dollar bill. To many, he remains a distant, mysterious, and unapproachable figure from a day long gone. The truth about George Washington, however, is much different. He was America&#39;s most successful, venerated, and indispensable founding father. So who was this man? What made him such a singularly successful leader? What lessons can be learned from his life? Confidence and Character: The Religious Life of George Washington examines religion&#39;s impact on the private and public man. Too often ignored, underemphasized, suppressed, or distorted, Washington&#39;s religious faith fundamentally inspired and nurtured his worldview, vocational performance, and leadership. This is the Washington we need to get to know and learn from, even today." />
