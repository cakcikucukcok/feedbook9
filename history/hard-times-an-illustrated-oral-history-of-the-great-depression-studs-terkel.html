With his trademark grace and compassion, Terkel evokes a mosaic of memories from those who were richest to those who were destitute: politicians, businessmen, artists and writers, racketeers, speakeasy operators, strikers, impoverished farmers, people who were just kids, and those who remember losing a fortune.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, in a handsome new illustrated edition, a selection of Studs&amp;#8217;s unforgettable interviews are complemented by images from another rich documentary trove of the Depression experience: Farm Security Administration photographs from the Library of Congress. Interspersed throughout the text of &lt;I&gt;Hard Times&lt;/I&gt;, these breathtaking photographs by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Jack Delano, and others expand the human scope of the voices captured in the book, adding a new dimension to Terkel&amp;#8217;s incomparable volume. &lt;I&gt;Hard Times&lt;/I&gt; is the perfect introduction to Terkel&amp;#8217;s work for new readers, as well as a beautiful new addition to any Terkel library.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
