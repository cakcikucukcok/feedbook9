  <title>Unraveling the Family History of Jesus - Steven Donald Norris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the Family History of Jesus approaches Jesus as an historical figure and sheds light on the details of the settings, the circumstances, and the context in which His family lived. Steven Donald Norrisdrawing upon a wide array of sourcesbrings to this work an historians sensibility of the broad sweep of events and a genealogists eye for capturing the fine nuances that make a familys own story unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical theological treatments of Jesus tend to regard Him as the Messiah because the New Testament identifies Him as a son of David. Unraveling the Family History of Jesus digs into the background and lineage of Jesus and, by uncovering the setting in lifeSitz im Lebenof His family, shows precisely how Jesus was a son of David and how Heby rightought to be acclaimed King of the Jews. In addition, this work documents the connections tying Jesuss extended family to several historical figures who played prominent roles in the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris work provides fresh insights that arise from meticulous reexaminations of existing historical sources. It traces the family ties binding Jesuss forebears and His extended family to one another and to Jesus Himself and tells how this familys influence changed the course of human history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
