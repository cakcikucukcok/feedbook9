  <title>In Lieu of a Draft - Lochard H. Lovenstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Lieu of a Draft: A History of the 153rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment documents the daily chores of camp life and the long hours spent waiting to engage the enemy, Historian James I. Robertson, Jr. has noted that soldiers spent more time in camp than on marches and in battle combined. This book presents the uncensored story and explores the deep political divisions within the regiment. William R. Kiefer, the regiment&#39;s historian, admitted that many incidents recorded in diaries had to be omitted, because they dealt with certain personal matters, offensive to some of the survivors, but which admittedly would otherwise have added relish to the stories.  Kiefer also had to exclude material he felt was heavily tainted with odium cast upon certain officers and written in such partisan style that the reader would find it unacceptable. The battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg are retold through the eyes of the 153rd volunteers as only they could have seen and experienced them. Every effort has been made to present this story as a chronological narrative of their service." />
