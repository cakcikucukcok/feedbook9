  <title>Infamy - Richard Reeves</title>

The U.S. Army immediately began rounding up thousands of Japanese-Americans, sometimes giving them less than 24 hours to vacate their houses and farms. For the rest of the war, these victims of war hysteria were imprisoned in primitive camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Infamy&lt;/i&gt;, the story of this appalling chapter in American history is told more powerfully than ever before. Acclaimed historian Richard Reeves has interviewed survivors, read numerous private letters and memoirs, and combed through archives to deliver a sweeping narrative of this atrocity. Men we usually consider heroes-FDR, Earl Warren, Edward R. Murrow-were in this case villains, but we also learn of many Americans who took great risks to defend the rights of the internees. Most especially, we hear the poignant stories of those who spent years in &quot;war relocation camps,&quot; many of whom suffered this terrible injustice with remarkable grace.&lt;br&gt;Racism, greed, xenophobia, and a thirst for revenge: a dark strand in the American character underlies this story of one of the most shameful episodes in our history. But by recovering the past, &lt;i&gt;Infamy&lt;/i&gt; has given voice to those who ultimately helped the nation better understand the true meaning of patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
