  <title>THEO&#39;S DIARY: A Novel of Love, War, and Regret - Barbara J Duell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theo sat on the old bench across from the cemetery and pulled his jacket close to his chest. The service for his closest friend had ended an hour ago but he would wait. After everyone left, Theo would go into the Friedhof, place his single rose atop the freshly turned soil, and say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now he sat in the cold and felt old. Life was such a temporary place, and he knew he could not wait any longer to do what needed to be done. He had to write down all he&amp;rsquo;d put away years ago, memories buried somewhere deep in a private place. He needed to reach beyond the comfort of these new days and unwrap the terrible; the hurt and anguish, of love found then lost, and all the regrets locked away but never forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Twenty years later and a continent away, family secrets revealed to Rick Dahlman demand he control his disbelief and anguish as he travels to Europe to unravel over thirty years of lies and deceit, a journey steeped in history. In a quest to find answers to his identity he will meet the classic, elegant Anna.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As Rick demands answers to his very existence from ghosts of the past, his emotional resolve is blindsided by the beautiful, headstrong Karlotta. Lost in a whirlpool of passion and desire so strong only their love and the surprising answers Rick finds in Theo&amp;rsquo;s diary will guide them to the awakening of a new life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And so begins Theo&amp;rsquo;s Diary. The reminiscence of love and pain, war and regret . . . A life that spans two world wars, two continents, and almost ninety-one years. In his simple way, Theo will share the good and the bad, dreams and devastation, relationships so filled with passion you will stop and draw in a breath, just to slow time. And lives will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
