  <title>An Execution in the Family - Robert Meeropol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Meeropol was six years old in 1953 when his parents, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, were executed after being convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union at the height of the McCarthy era. Just before they were put to death, the Rosenbergs wrote a letter to their two sons saying they were &quot;secure in the knowledge that others would carry on after them.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rosenbergs left their young sons a legacy that was both a burden and a gift, as well as an aching emotional void. Robert Meeropol grew up torn between the need to pursue his political values and his intense fear that personal exposure might subject him and his family to violence or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Execution in the Family&lt;/i&gt; details Robert Meeropol&#39;s political odyssey from being the Rosenbergs&#39; son to becoming a prominent political activist in his own right, and it chronicles a very personal journey of self-discovery. This is the story of how he tried to balance a strong desire to live a normal life and raise a family with a growing need to create something useful out of his childhood nightmare. It is also a poignant account of how, at age forty-three, he finally found a way to honor his parents and be true to himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
