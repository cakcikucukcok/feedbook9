  <title>What Rebels Want - Jennifer M. Hazen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;How easy is it for rebel groups to purchase weapons and ammunition in the middle of a war? How quickly can commodities such as diamonds and cocoa be converted into cash to buy war supplies? And why does answering these questions matter for understanding civil wars? In &lt;em&gt;What Rebels Want&lt;/em&gt;, Jennifer M. Hazen challenges the commonly held view that rebel groups can get what they want, when they want it, and when they most need it. Hazen&#39;s assessments of resource availability in the wars in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d&#39;Ivoire lead to a better understanding of rebel group capacity and options for war and war termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resources entail more than just cash; they include various other economic, military, and political goods, including natural resources, arms and ammunition, safe haven, and diplomatic support. However, rebel groups rarely enjoy continuous access to resources throughout a conflict. Understanding fluctuations in fortune is central to identifying the options available to rebel groups and the reasons why a rebel group chooses to pursue war or peace. The stronger the group&#39;s capacity, the more options it possesses with respect to fighting a war. The chances for successful negotiations and the implementation of a peace agreement increase as the options of the rebel group narrow. Sustainable negotiated solutions are most likely, Hazen finds, when a rebel group views negotiations not as one of the solutions for obtaining what it wants, but as the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
