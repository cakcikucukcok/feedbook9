  <title>Letters from the Heart - Carole Webb Slater</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letters from the Heart is a story of Dana A. Webb, Jr., Cobby,, a P-51 pilot, assigned to the 328th Fighter Squadron and the 352nd Fighter Group stationed in England and Belgium during World War II.  It is a work of nonfiction based primarily on letters written by Cobby Webb to his parents and his girlfriend, Evelyn, who later became his wife. There are more than 250 letters telling the story of a young pilot in training and in war, a son devoted to his family, and the love between a man and woman who meet by chance and find magic that lasts a lifetime. The book reads like a diary and includes stories and information related to daily life at home, at various aviation cadet training sites, and historical events happening in the United States and abroad during 1940&#39;s wartime.
World War II, unlike other wars since, brought the United States of America together as a country, united for the good of all. The generation of men and women who grew up during the Great Depression and went on to fight in World War II or contribute on the home front became known as The Greatest Generation. They sacrificed and fought because it was the right thing to do, and afterward, they rebuilt America into a world power. This book holds the experiences, feelings, and words of two of Americas greatest generation." />
