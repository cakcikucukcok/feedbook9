  <title>Long Overdue - Charles P. Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever since the unfulfilled promise of &amp;#8220;forty acres and a mule,&amp;#8221; America has consistently failed to confront the issue of racial injustice. Exploring why America has failed to compensate Black Americans for the wrongs of slavery, &lt;B&gt;Long Overdue&lt;/B&gt; provides a history of the racial reparations movement and shows why it is an idea whose time has come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., remarked in his &amp;#8220;I Have a Dream&amp;#8221; speech that America has given Black citizens a “bad check” marked &amp;#8220;insufficient funds.&amp;#8221; Yet apart from a few Black nationalists, the call for reparations has been peripheral to Black policy demands. Charles P. Henry examines Americans&amp;#8217;unwillingness to confront this economic injustice, and crafts a skillful moral, political, economic, and historical argument for African American reparations, focusing on successful political cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of recent successes in South Africa and New Zealand, new models for reparations have recently found traction in a number of American cities and states, from Dallas to Baltimore and Virginia to California. By looking at other dispossessed groups &amp;#8212; Native Americans, Holocaust survivors, and Japanese internment victims in the 1940s &amp;#8212; Henry shows how some groups have won the fight for reparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hurricane Katrina made apparent, the legacy of racial segregation and economic disadvantage is never far below the surface in America. &lt;B&gt;Long Overdue&lt;/B&gt; provides an up-to-date survey of the political and legislative efforts that are now breaking the surface to move reparations into the heart of our national discussion about race.&lt;/p&gt;" />
