  <title>Gold Dust On His Shirt - Irene Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gold Dust on His Shirt&lt;/em&gt; is an evocative telling of the experience of a Scandinavian immigrant family of hard-rock miners at the turn of the century and up to World War II. Based on fascinating historical research, these are tales of arriving in &amp;#8216;Amerika,&amp;#8217; blasting the Grand Trunk Pacific railway, work in the mines, and domestic life and labour struggles in company towns throughout British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part family history, part economic and social history, &lt;em&gt;Gold Dust on His Shirt&lt;/em&gt; is an intriguing look at life on the industrial frontier, the world of immigrant workers and the rise of unions such as the Wobblies. This remarkable and provocative tale of a family, region and era references a number of broader social and political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to Scandinavian parents, &lt;strong&gt;Irene Howard&lt;/strong&gt; has devoted her writing career to combining her interest in labour and immigrant history with her love of literature. She has been an English instructor and has broadcast talks for the CBC and written articles and essays for Canadian magazines and journals. She is the author of several books, including &lt;em&gt;The Struggle for Social Justice in British Columbia: Helena Gutteridge, the Unknown Reformer&lt;/em&gt;, which in 1993 won the University of British Columbia Silver Medal for Canadian Biography and was shortlisted for a City of Vancouver Book Award and the Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize.&lt;/p&gt;" />
