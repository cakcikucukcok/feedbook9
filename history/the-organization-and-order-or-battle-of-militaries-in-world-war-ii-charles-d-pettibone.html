  <title>The Organization and Order or Battle of Militaries in World War Ii - Charles D. Pettibone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are numerous Order of Battle books on the market. So what makes this one so special? Why should one decide on this particular book? Most Order of Battle books usually deal only at the division and corps level of a countrys army. Most higher commands are not covered. This book deals with all the branches of a countrys military, giving a breakdown of all the major echelons of command, from theater down to brigade, under each component (army group, armies, corps, division, and brigade), and the equivalent command for the other military branches are included.
Second, it attempts to give an overall command structure of the countrys military, showing the central headquarters command structure as well as the major components (army groups, armies, corps, etc.).
Third, most Order of Battle books list the commander and their dates of tenure. This one includes those but also lists their next duty assignments or where they went after leaving the post. One can literally trace a general officers career through the upper echelons of command, making this series completely different from all the others on the market." />
