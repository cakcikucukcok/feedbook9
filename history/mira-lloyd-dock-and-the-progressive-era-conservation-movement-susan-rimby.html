  <title>Mira Lloyd Dock and the Progressive Era Conservation Movement - Susan Rimby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For her time, Mira Lloyd Dock was an exceptional woman: a university-trained botanist, lecturer, women&amp;rsquo;s club leader, activist in the City Beautiful movement, and public official&amp;mdash;the first woman to be appointed to Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s state government. In her twelve years on the Pennsylvania Forest Commission, she allied with the likes of J. T. Rothrock, Gifford Pinchot, and Dietrich Brandis to help bring about a new era in American forestry. She was also an integral force in founding and fostering the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy in Mont Alto, which produced generations of Pennsylvania foresters before becoming Penn State&#39;s Mont Alto campus. Though much has been written about her male counterparts, &lt;em&gt;Mira Lloyd Dock and the Progressive Era Conservation Movement&lt;/em&gt; is the first book dedicated to Mira Lloyd Dock and her work. Susan Rimby weaves these layers of Dock&amp;rsquo;s story together with the greater historical context of the era to create a vivid and accessible picture of Progressive Era conservation in the eastern United States and Dock&amp;rsquo;s important role and legacy in that movement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
