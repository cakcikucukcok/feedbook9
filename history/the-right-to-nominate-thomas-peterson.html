  <title>The Right to Nominate - Thomas Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Government of the parties, by the parties, and for the partiesis this what the Framers of the Constitution designed? Is this the fate of the American Republic?
Fewer than 5 percent of Americans today know that the party system is not in the Constitution. The Framers loathed political parties, and the sovereign position they designed for the American peopleto rule over all parties and interest groups through our elected representativeshas been stripped from us.
The Right to Nominate unveils this fundamental dysfunction that now permeates every aspect of American government.
We the people have been so enfeebled by our loss of sovereignty that we are now helpless to stop politicians from shutting down our government or even bankrupting our country.
Though the Constitution was purposely written to stop political parties from taking over government, today fewer than 1 percent of the people know where those antiparty clauses are. By exploiting one weakness in the framers magnificent design, the parties have stolen the American peoples sovereignty by quietly transforming the peoples representatives into party representatives. The Right to Nominate shows how they did it, and what the terrible consequences have been. 
The Right to Nominate presents a simple but revolutionary answer for the political rebirth of Americafor breaking the chokehold of party control, for the return of the peoples sovereignty, and for the triumph of representative government.
Two hundred years of electoral experience are distilled to reveal the missing cornerstone of representative government, the unredeemed right of the American people: the right to nominate.
Amendment XXVIII, offered here, will establish a Constitutional mechanism for the people to nominate nonparty candidates, breaking the parties stranglehold over elections by opening up more rights and more freedom for Americans." />
