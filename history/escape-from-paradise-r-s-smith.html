  <title>Escape from Paradise - R.S Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Escape from Paradise, book II of The Lion Awakes series,
reveals some of historys most ancient mysteries. Based
on archaeological discoveries and ancient texts, Escape from
Paradise follows Two Sons from Egypt, portraying the destinies
of Amenhotep II, Pharaoh of the Exodus, and the Hebrew prophet
Moses, bringing to life this battle of gods and men. The explosion
of an island north of the Delta, the mysterious death of a royal son
of the 18th dynasty, and the remains of an army of the same period
recently found at the bottom of the Red Sea are some of the factual
evidences woven into the fabric of this timeless tale.
How would the Egyptians have reacted to the plagues, and what
would Pharaohs response have been to the challenge to match
the miracles? 
Experience the Exodus through the eyes of the
Egyptians, reliving the catastrophes that brought one nation to
its knees while providing an escape for the other. In a fast paced
colorful style, Escape from Paradise portrays actual characters
and events in a tale of adventure, conflict, and intrigue. Discover
the story behind the biblical account that continues to reverberate
throughout history.
 . . . every day I encounter dozens of would-be writers who want
someone to take a look at their work. And, as you might expect, there are
only a handful with skills that show true merit. Thats why I encourage
you to take a look at this book . . . Theres a great story here . . ..
