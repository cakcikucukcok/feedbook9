  <title>Analects - David Hinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;While Confucius failed in his lifetime to rescue a crumbling civilization with his teachings, he was to become the most influential sage in human history. His thought, still remarkably current and even innovative after 2500 years, survives here in &lt;I&gt; The Analects &lt;/I&gt; &amp;#151; a collection of brief aphoristic sayings that has had a deeper impact on more people&#39;s lives over a longer period of time than any other book in human history.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Formulated in the ruins of a society that had been founded on untenable spiritualistic concepts of governance, Confucius&#39; philosophy postulated a humanistic social order that has survived as China&#39;s social ideal ever since. Beginning with the realization that society is a structure of human relationships, Confucius saw that in a healthy society this structure must be a selfless weave of caring relationships. Those caring relationships are a system of &quot;ritual&quot; that people enact in their daily lives, thus infusing the secular with scared dimensions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Highly regarded for the poetic fluency he brings to his award-winning work, David Hinton is the first twentieth-century translator to render the four central masterworks of ancient Chinese thought: &lt;I&gt; Chuang Tzu, Mencius, The Analects, &lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt; Tao te Ching &lt;/I&gt; (forthcoming). HIs new versions are not only inviting and immensely readable, but they also apply a much-needed consistency to key terms in these texts, lending structural links and philosophical rigor heretofore unavailable in  English. Breathing new life into these originary classics, Hinton&#39;s translations will stand as the definitive series for our era.&lt;/div&gt;" />
