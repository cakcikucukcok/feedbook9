  <title>Historical Dictionary of the Puritans - Charles Pastoor, Galen K. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Members of the Church of England until the mid-16th century, the Puritans thought the Church had become too political and needed to be &#39;purified.&#39; While many Puritans believed the Church was capable of reform, a large number decided that separating from the Church was their only remaining course of action. Thus the mass migration of Puritans (known as Pilgrims), to America took place. Although Puritanism died in England around 1689 and in America in 1758, Puritan beliefs, such as self-reliance, frugality, industry, and energy remain standards of the American ideal. The Historical Dictionary of Puritans tells the story of Puritanism from its origins until its eventual demise. This is done through a chronology, an introduction, a bibliography, and several hundred cross-referenced dictionary entries on important people, places, and events." />
