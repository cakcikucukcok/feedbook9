  <title>Europe&#39;s Last Chance - Guy Verhofstadt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the heart of Europe&#39;s current crisis, one of the continent&#39;s foremost statesmen issues a clarion call to radically remake the European Union in the mold of the United States&#39; own federal government&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Europe is caught in its greatest crisis since the Second World War. The catalog of ills seems endless: an economic crisis spread through most of Europe&#39;s Mediterranean tier that has crippled Greece and driven a wedge between northern and southern Europe; terrorist attacks in Paris, Cologne, Brussels, and Nice; growing aggression from Russia in Ukraine and the Baltic states; and refugees escaping war-torn neighbors. The European Union&#39;s inability to handle any of these disasters was a driving factor in Great Britain voting to leave, and others may soon follow. The result won&#39;t just be a continent in turmoil, but also a serious threat to American and British security-the Atlantic, let alone the Channel, simply isn&#39;t big enough to keep European troubles in Europe. For everyone&#39;s sake, Europe must survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is how. In &lt;i&gt;Europe&#39;s Last Chance&lt;/i&gt;, Guy Verhofstadt-former prime minister of Belgium and current leader of the liberal faction in the European Parliament-provides the essential framework for understanding Europe today, laying bare the absurdity of a system in which each member state can veto legislation, opt in or out of the Euro, or close borders on a whim. But Verhofstadt does not just indict the European Union, he also offers a powerful vision for how the continent can change for the better. The key, argues Verhofstadt, is to reform the European Union along the lines of America&#39;s federal government: a United States of Europe strong enough to stand with the United States of America in making a better, safer world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A visionary book from one of today&#39;s luminaries of European leadership, &lt;i&gt;Europe&#39;s Last Chance&lt;/i&gt; is a clarion call to save the European Union, one of the world&#39;s greatest chances for peace and prosperity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
