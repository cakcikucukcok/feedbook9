  <title>Korea: The Impossible Country - Daniel Tudor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;[Long overshadowed by Japan and China, South Korea is a small country that happens to be one of the great national success stories of the postwar period. From a failed state with no democratic tradition, ruined and partitioned by war, and sapped by a half-century of colonial rule, South Korea transformed itself in just fifty years into an economic powerhouse and a democracy that serves as a model for other countries. With no natural resources and a tradition of authoritarian rule, Korea managed to accomplish a second Asian miracle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Daniel Tudor&lt;/I&gt; is a journalist who has lived in and written about Korea for almost a decade. In &lt;I&gt;Korea: The Impossible Country&lt;/I&gt;, Tudor examines Korea&#39;s cultural foundations; the Korean character; the public sphere in politics, business, and the workplace as well as the family, dating, and marriage. In doing so, he touches on topics as diverse as shamanism, clan-ism, the dilemma posed by North Korea, the myths about doing business in Korea, the Koreans&#39; renowned hard-partying ethos, and why the infatuation with learning English is now causing huge social problems.]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;South Korea has undergone two miracles at once: economic development and complete democratization. The question now is, will it become as some see Japan, a rich yet aging society, devoid of energy and momentum? Or will the dynamism of Korean society and its willingness to change&amp;#151;as well as the opportunity it has now to welcome outsiders into its fold&amp;#151;enable it to experience a third miracle that will propel it into the ranks of the world&amp;#8217;s leading nations in terms of human culture, democracy, and wealth?&lt;/div&gt;" />
