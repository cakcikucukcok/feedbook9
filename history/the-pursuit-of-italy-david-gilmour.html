  <title>The Pursuit of Italy - David Gilmour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s 2011 Books of the Year &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did  Garibaldi do Italy a disservice when he helped its disparate parts  achieve unity? Was the goal of political unification a mistake? These  questions are asked and answered in a number of ways in this engaging,  original consideration of the many histories that contribute to the  brilliance-and weakness-of Italy today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Gilmour&#39;s  wonderfully readable ex­ploration of Italian life over the centuries is  filled with provocative anecdotes as well as personal observations, and  is peopled with the great fig­ures of the Italian past-from Cicero and  Virgil to Dante and the Medicis, from Garibaldi and Cavour to the  controversial politicians of the twentieth century. Gilmour&#39;s wise  account of the Risorgimento, the pivotal epoch in modern Italian  history, debunks the nationalistic myths that surround it, though he  paints a sympathetic portrait of Giuseppe Verdi, a beloved hero of the  era. Gilmour shows that the glory of Italy has always lain in its  regions, with their distinc­tive art, civic cultures, identities, and  cuisines. Italy&#39;s inhabitants identified themselves not as Italians but  as Tuscans and Venetians, Sicilians and Lombards, Neapolitans and  Genoese. Italy&#39;s strength and culture still come from its regions rather  than from its misconceived, mishandled notion of a unified nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Pursuit of Italy&lt;/i&gt;,  David Gilmour has provided a coherent, persuasive, and entertain­ing  interpretation of the paradoxes of Italian life, past and present.&lt;/p&gt;" />
