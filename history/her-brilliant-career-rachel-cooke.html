  <title>Her Brilliant Career - Rachel Cooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An exuberant group biography&amp;#8212;&quot;a splendidly various collection of &#39;brief lives&#39; written with both gusto and sensitivity&quot; (&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;#8212;that follows ten women in 1950s Britain whose pioneering lives paved the way for feminism and laid the foundation of modern women&#39;s success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Her Brilliant Career&lt;/em&gt;, Rachel Cooke goes back in time to offer an entertaining and iconoclastic look at ten women in the 1950s&amp;#8212;pioneers whose professional careers and complicated private lives helped to create the opportunities available to today&#39;s women. These plucky and ambitious individuals&amp;#8212;among them a film director, a cook, an architect, an editor, an archaeologist, a race car driver&amp;#8212;left the house, discovered the bliss of work, and ushered in the era of the working woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daring and independent, these remarkable unsung heroines&amp;#8212;whose obscurity makes their accomplishments all the more astonishing and relevant &amp;#8212;loved passionately, challenged men&#39;s control, made their own mistakes, and took life on their own terms, breaking new ground and offering inspiration. Their individual portraits gradually form a landscape of 1950s culture, and women&#39;s unique&amp;#8212;and rapidly evolving&amp;#8212;role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before there could be a Danica Patrick, there had to be a Sheila van Damm; before there was Barbara Walters, there was Nancy Spain; before there was Kathryn Bigelow, came Muriel Box. The pioneers of &lt;em&gt;Her Brilliant Career&lt;/em&gt; forever changed the fabric of culture, society, and the work force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Fifties, retold: vivid, surprising and, most of all, modern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her Brilliant Career&lt;/em&gt; is illustrated with more than 80 black-and-white photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
