  <title>The Islamic War on Christians - Peter Riga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In some 31 short chapters (182 pages) the author attempts to show why there is such intolerance of Christianity in almost every majority Muslim country in the Islamic world. There is no such persecution of Islam in the West which lives under Judeo-Christian values with respect and tolerance for Islam. The contrasts is startling. Why is this so? Even in the West through acts of terrorism and other forms of stealth jihad, there is a whole movement to convert the West to Islam if not by violent jihad (holy war) then by stealth jihad (a slow integration of sharia (Muslim holy law) into the West under guise of religious freedom offered in the West. This conflict is global in nature, violent in Muslim countries, non violent in the West. This conflict seems to be a one way street with Muslims attacking Christians while Christians seem to offer little or no resistance. This must change if there is to be true peace in this world. But first there must be a realization of this war on Christians by Islam and why this is so. This book attempts to do just that." />
