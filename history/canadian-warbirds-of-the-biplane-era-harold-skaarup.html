  <title>Canadian Warbirds of the Biplane Era. - Harold Skaarup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This aviation handbook provides a quick general reference to identify and briefly describe military aircraft flown by Canadians during WWI and in the post-war Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Navy, and the Canadian Army during the biplane era.  The handbooks in this series include a general description and a photograph from the Canadian Forces Archives of at least one of the key variants or marks of each aircraft that has been in Canadian service or used by Canadian servicemen overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
Each aircraft is listed alphabetically by manufacturer, number and type. General details describing the aircrafts engines, service ceiling, speed, armament and weapons load are included, along with a brief description of the Canadian squadrons which flew the aircraft.
This is the first volume in the series.  It describes the fighters, bombers and patrol aircraft flown by Canadian servicemen during the biplane era.  A list of museums, private aircraft collections and other locations where a number of the survivors might be found is also included.  The handbook is not a definitive list of all Canadian-manufactured or operated aircraft, but should serve as a quick reminder for anyone with an enthusiastic interest in Canadian military aviation." />
