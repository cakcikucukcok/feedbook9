  <title>Speedy - Francisco Elizalde-Castañeda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many years after fighting in the Vietnam War, Elizalde decided to write this book which was dormant in his subconscious all that time.
Not everyone in the war fought the frontlines of battle as it is depicted in the movies. Instead, many of them provided support services to the Infantry and the Marines in many ways:
transportation, administration, and graves registration - where Elizalde served. For him being a Hero is someone who gives his life to defend his country. However, in this case, there was no reason for these soldiers to fight. They were deceived just like all the American people.
One thing is certain, they served as cannon fodder. They were there to protect the interest not of the American people, but rather those of the commercial and military establishments
who yield the power and do not care about wasting money and innocent lives.
The author hopes that this book will be able to give the reader another perspective on the Vietnam War.
