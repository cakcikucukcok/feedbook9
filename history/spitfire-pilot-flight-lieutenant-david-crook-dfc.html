  <title>Spitfire Pilot - Flight Lieutenant David Crook DFC</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Spitfire Pilot&amp;quot; was written in 1940 in the heat of battle when the RAF stood alone against the might of Hitler&amp;#39;s Third Reich. It is a tremendous personal account of one of the fiercest and most idealised air conflicts - the Battle of Britain - seen through the eyes of a pilot of the famous 609 Squadron, which shot down over 100 planes in that epic contest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Moore Crook, DFC (1914 - 1944) was a British fighter pilot and flying ace of the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After attending the University of Cambridge, he was mobilised as part of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force on the outbreak of war. Flying the Spitfire Crook participated in the Battle of Britain, flying with No. 609 Squadron RAF (at the time this was a squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force). He initially joined the squadron on 22 September 1938 as an acting pilot officer, this rank was confirmed on 4 May 1940, and later further back-dated to 9 December 1939. He destroyed a Junkers Ju 87 of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77) on 9 July, and a Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53) Messerschmitt Bf 109 on 13 August. On 15 August 1940, he mistakenly shot down a Blenheim fighter, although the crew was only slightly injured. Two Bf 109&amp;#39;s were claimed on 30 September 1940.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flying Spitfire IX EN662 on 18 December 1944 on a high level photographic sortie, Crook was seen to dive into the sea near Aberdeen. He was officially listed as missing in action." />
