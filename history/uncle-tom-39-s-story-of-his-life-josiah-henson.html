  <title>Uncle Tom&#39;s Story of His Life - Josiah Henson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This 1876 version of Josiah Henson&#39;s autobiography, the first of many editions issued by British editor John Lobb, followed the original 1849 edition and a much-expanded 1858 version. The autobiography traces Henson&#39;s life from his birth into slavery in Maryland in 1789; his escape to Canada in 1830; his participation in the founding of the Dawn Settlement for fugitive slaves in Ontario; and his several trips to England to raise funds for the settlement. Henson, who in his later years toured as the model for the Uncle Tom of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#39;s novel, describes his meeting with Stowe in 1852 and draws parallels between the histories of other &lt;i&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/i&gt; characters and his own acquaintances. While Stowe herself stressed that there was no single model for her title character, she called Henson a &quot;parallel instance&quot; for Uncle Tom in &lt;i&gt;A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/i&gt;. Reprinted multiple times in the United States and Britain in the nineteenth century and translated into several other languages, Henson&#39;s autobiography continues to reward readers with its descriptions not only of slave life in Maryland and Kentucky, but also of the business and educational ventures of escaped slaves in Ontario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DOCSOUTH BOOK. This collaboration between UNC Press and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library brings classic works back into print.
