  <title>Kalashnikov AK47 Series - Martin J Brayley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Popularly known as the AK47 or just AK, the 7.62mm Avtomat Kalashnikov obrazets 1947g was accepted into service by the Soviet Army in 1947. Despite its widespread use by the Soviet armed forces, the AK only became known in the West during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when Soviet troops sent to quell the uprising carried the new weapon. Since then it has become probably the most widely recognized firearm of all time, having seen action in most of the conflicts of the past six decades.The Kalashnikov has been produced in many variants and calibres, and this book concentrates on those in the original 7.62mm form. Illustrated with over 350 colour photographs of AK variants produced around the world, including close-ups of the many fascinating detail differences, this work will be an invaluable addition to the bookshelf of anyone with an interest in modern military firearms. The most widely used firearm of the post-war era - the Kalashnikov rifle has become an icon of revolutionary struggle. Covers the principal design features of the AK variants that used the original 7.62x39mm M1943 cartridge. Will be of great interest to militaria enthusiasts, collectors and military historians of modern military firearms. Superbly illustrated with 350 colour photographs showing the different versions produced around the world. Martin J Brayley has a keen interest in military history and is a professional photogapher, author and dedicated militaria researcher and collector." />
