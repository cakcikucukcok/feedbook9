  <title>Slavery in the Great Lakes Region of East Africa - Henri Médard, Shane Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slavery in the Great Lakes Region of East Africa&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of ten studies by the most prominent historians of the region. Slavery was more important in the Great Lakes region of Eastern Africa than often has been assumed, and Africans from the interior played a more complex role than was previously recognized. The essays in this collection reveal the connections between the peoples of the region as well as their encounters with the conquering Europeans. The contributors challenge the assertion that domestic slavery increased in Africa as a result of the international trade. Slavery in this region was not a uniform phenomenon and the line between enslaved and non-slave labor was fine. Kinship ties could mark the difference between free and unfree labor. Social categories were not always clear-cut and the status of a slave could change within a lifetime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
