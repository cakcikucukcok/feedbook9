  <title>Jefferson - John B. Boles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;From an eminent scholar of the American South, the first full-scale biography of Thomas Jefferson since 1970&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Not since Merrill Peterson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation&lt;/i&gt; has a scholar attempted to write a comprehensive biography of the most complex Founding Father. In &lt;i&gt;Jefferson&lt;/i&gt;, John B. Boles plumbs every facet of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s life, all while situating him amid the sweeping upheaval of his times. We meet Jefferson the politician and political thinker--as well as Jefferson the architect, scientist, bibliophile, paleontologist, musician, and gourmet. We witness him drafting of the Declaration of Independence, negotiating the Louisiana Purchase, and inventing a politics that emphasized the states over the federal government--a political philosophy that shapes our national life to this day. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Boles offers new insight into Jefferson&#39;s actions and thinking on race. His Jefferson is not a hypocrite, but a tragic figure--a man who could not hold simultaneously to his views on abolition, democracy, and patriarchal responsibility. Yet despite his flaws, Jefferson&#39;s ideas would outlive him and make him into nothing less than the architect of American liberty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
