  <title>They liked me, the horses, straightaway - Marty Dodd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;This day we were going to let the horses go. They&amp;rsquo;d been working for a while and it was their turn to have a spell. Old Alf Turner came down there watching the blokes tying their horses&amp;rsquo; legs up. And he seen me get my horse and bring him up &amp;ndash; just drop the reins on the ground and the horse waiting down there while I went and got the hammer and the chisel and the rasp to just pull the shoe off.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then he seen me pick the horse&amp;rsquo;s leg up &amp;ndash; pick it up and just hold it while the horse was standing there. And he was thinking, &amp;lsquo;Hey, what&amp;rsquo;s this bloke! Hey! He should tie his legs up.&amp;rsquo; And he called out to me, &amp;lsquo;Hey! He might turn and kick you!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;No,&amp;rsquo; I said. &amp;lsquo;He be right.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I just took the horse&amp;rsquo;s shoe off and he just standing there with his head down and I was there holding his leg up. Old Alf Turner got the biggest shock and he gave me the job of breaking horses after that, because the other blokes&amp;rsquo; horses still wild. They can&amp;rsquo;t touch a horse or the horse would kick them or something. But mine, mine were just quiet with me straightaway. That&amp;rsquo;s why he gave me the job breaking in horses. Horses &amp;ndash; I got to like horses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They liked me, the horses, straightaway.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His former jockey, and later boss, Ian Rankin, once called Marty Dodd &amp;lsquo;the kindest man who ever lived&amp;rsquo;. This is Marty Dodd&amp;rsquo;s remarkable story, told in his own words.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;As an Anangu child who was forcibly removed and as a parent who single-handedly parented seven children, Mr Dodd fought the odds to become the winner of horse races and an even bigger winner in life.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Dr Irene Watson, Tanganekald woman, lawyer, activist and academic&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;From exploitation to independence &amp;ndash; a story of resilience that needed to be told. Marty Dodd&amp;rsquo;s experiences and philosophy make a worthwhile addition to the growing literature of Aboriginal autobiography.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; Christobel Mattingley, AM, DUnivSA, editor/researcher of &lt;em&gt;Survival in Our Own Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
