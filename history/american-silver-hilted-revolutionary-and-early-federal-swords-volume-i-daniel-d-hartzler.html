  <title>American Silver-Hilted, Revolutionary and Early Federal Swords Volume I - Daniel D. Hartzler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This publication gives the sword enthusiast an opportunity to observe edged weapons made, for the most part, in the United States that display regional characteristics that often transcend state lines. The makers of these swords, many of whom were silversmiths as well, had learned the skills and peculiarities of their masters during apprenticeship before yielding to the desires of the shop owner as journeymen. Later, many of these often relocated to new localities, practicing their former traits before they could open their own establishment, where they would be free to exercise their own creative ingenuities.
	Mr. Hartzler has done an excellent job in ferreting out edged weapons, especially swords, and their makers from throughout the country and identifying who they were and where and when they were in business. His identification of the styles and characteristics of the various swords, as well as the region from which they came, will be immensely helpful to students in their future study of these weapons.
	His unique method of presentation, illustrating what state or region these weapons originated from, as well as their individual characteristics, elucidate the various styles and traits developed throughout the different areas. One can also follow the travels of a sword maker by the pattern of his products." />
