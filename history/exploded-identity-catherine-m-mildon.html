  <title>Exploded Identity - Catherine M. Mildon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
I was four and half years old and living in Halifax with my seven siblings the day my city was devastated by an exploding ship in the harbour. It threw me to the floor as our windows collapsed. In the days, weeks, months and years that followed, this vivid, terrifying moment and the stories of altered lives dominated our daily thoughts and conversations. As CEO of the Northern Electric Company in Halifax, my father was heavily involved in the immediate demands. Years later I felt driven to record my family experiences and to study thoroughly the record of those awful days. As I wrote, I was struck by the overwhelming determination, heroism and cooperation that the unheralded citizens of Halifax demonstrated in the face of death, destruction and snowstorms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For centuries women have known that when war came they would be needed for their sheets torn up for bandages, for clothing and for food.  So, the women of Halifax met in August 1914 and made tentative plans should Halifax be attacked. Some don&#39;t believe it.  Yet war was very frightening in a seaport city.  And these Halifax ladies were the women who, two years before, gathered at city hall behind long tables with pen and paper to assist survivors of the Titanic to identify bodies  gathered up from the sea and brought to Halifax on our own ships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the Explosion went off the wife of a judge met her friend and arrived at the city hall by 9:30 a.m.  They swept up glass and plaster knowing that the women would be coming soon with everything they had mustered.  At 11:30 a.m. one of the city councillors came downstairs and said to the women &quot;Give everything to everybody who asks&quot;.  Half-naked, blackened, bloodied people had been coming in all morning.    The women were ready with &quot;everything for everybody&quot; because the ladies had planned for an attack.
