  <title>Kierkegaard&#39;s Universe. A Guide to the Genius - Johannes Sløk, Kenneth Tindall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2013 we celebrate Kierkegaard’s 200th birthday with this magnificent guide from one of the most acclaimed Danish Kierkegaard experts.
There are many reasons why Kierkegaard is outrageously hard to read. By virtue of the originality of his genious Kierkegaard’s authorship is a universe apart. There are many ways one can try to penetrate it, and can naturally also do so on one’s own. But when you come to a strange country it is always wise to start off by seeking the help of a guide, who is familiar both with the roads and with the sights, that is, a kind of orienting introduction which can smooth the further passage on one’s own.
That is what this book wishes to be. Thereforeit is not addressed to the specialist, and even though I have written it going from my personal conception of the matter its errand is not to contribute to any debate. It offers its services to all who wish to try to get inside the Kierkegaardian world of ideas. Going from the insight I think I have arrived at, I offer it as a key to that singular universe.
