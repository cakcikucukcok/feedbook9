  <title>Coming to Pass: Florida&#39;s Coastal Islands in a Gulf of Change - Susan Cerulean, David Moynahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Coming to Pass&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; tells the story of a little-developed necklace of northern Gulf Coast islands. Both a field guide to a beloved and impermanent Florida landscape and a call for its protection, Susan Cerulean&amp;#8217;s memoir chronicles the uniquely beautiful coast as it once was, as it is now, and as it may be as the sea level rises.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For decades, Cerulean has kayaked, hiked, and counted birds on and around Dog, the St. Georges, and St. Vincent Islands with family and friends. She has collected scallops, snorkeled over a fallen lighthouse a mile offshore, and cast nets and fishing lines into cyclical runs of mullet and shrimp.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like most people, she didn&amp;#8217;t know how the islands had come to be or understand the large-scale change coming to the coast. With her husband, oceanographer Jeff Chanton, she studied the genesis of the coast and its inextricable link to the Apalachicola River. She interviewed scientists as they tracked and tallied magnificent and dwindling sea turtles, snowy white beach mice, and endangered plants. Illustrated with images from prizewinning nature photographer David Moynahan, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Coming to Pass&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is the culmination of Cerulean&amp;#8217;s explorations and a reflection of our spiritual relationship and responsibilities to the world that holds us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
