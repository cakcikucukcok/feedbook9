  <title>The Whitetail Deer Head Book For The Taxidermist - Leon Pray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This early work on taxidermy is a fascinating read for the amateur or professional taxidermist and also contains much information that is still useful today. Its 40 pages are extensively illustrated with drawings and diagrams and form a complete how-to guide to the taxidermy of deer. Contents Include: Introduction; Deer Heads, Good, Bad and Indifferent; Head Forms and Ear Liners, As Mostly Found Compared With Nature; Posing the Deer Head for Expression; Judging Deer Antlers; Measurements of Whitetail Heads and Shape of Head Forms and Ear Liners; Pedestal Deer Heads; Care of Mounted Deer Heads; Glass and Plastic Deer Heads; Glass and Plastic Deer Eyes; Quality in Whitetail Scalps. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. We are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork." />
