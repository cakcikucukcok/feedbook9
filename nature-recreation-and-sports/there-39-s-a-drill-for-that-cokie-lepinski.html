  <title>There&#39;s a Drill for That! - Cokie Lepinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever noticed how technical swimming has become? There are so many fine points to all four strokes. You really need to break the stroke and its components down and work on them separately, and then put the stroke back together. In the process of doing this, you begin to understand much more about the stroke and about yourself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the best ways to refine your stroke, find efficiency in the water, and translate that to faster swimming, is to regularly build swim drills into your swim practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this eBook, you will find 125 drills covering freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and even sculling. Each drill has a title, a purpose, and a thorough description of the drill, along with key points to focus on when doing the drill. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only will practicing drills help your stroke, your efficiency, and eventually your speed, drill work will also help liven up your practices, making them much more interesting and challenging. Doing so under the guidance of a coach and support of a team is even better, so find yourself a team. You won&amp;#39;t regret it. If you are a masters swimmer, check out www.usms.org to find more information on US Masters Swimming, locate a team near you, and see everything this great sport has to offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dive right in. I hope you enjoy this eBook and that your swimming skills grow by leaps and bounds. Happy swimming!" />
