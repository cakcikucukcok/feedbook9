  <title>The Fire Within - Carmela Dolce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Falling in love is never easy, especially when a deadly volcano awakens beneath your city, threatening everything you hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aurora Fortunas is an aspiring physician living in the celebrated city of Pompeii. Scholarly, proud, and devoted to family, she has refused every suitor for fear that a domineering man will crush her independence. When an earthquake strikes, bringing her on a collision course with a handsome stranger, she finds him old-fashioned, imperious, and utterly captivating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evander Mercurius is worldly, strong, and fearless. His belief that a woman should know her place and a man should always have the final word is challenged when he meets the beautiful and fiery Aurora. Tasked by his father to secure his family&amp;#39;s business ties to the new emperor of Rome, he finds himself forced to choose between the love of the beautiful healer and the temptation of political gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mount Vesuvius roars to life, shaking the city to its foundation, Aurora&amp;#39;s healing skills and Evander&amp;#39;s loyalties are put to the test. As the mountain&amp;#39;s wrath rains down upon them, can they learn to compromise, find their inner strength, and save their newfound love before it&amp;#39;s too late?&lt;/p&gt;" />
