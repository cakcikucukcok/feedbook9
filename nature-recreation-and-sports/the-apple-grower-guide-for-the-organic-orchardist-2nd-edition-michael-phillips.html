  <title>The Apple Grower: Guide for the Organic Orchardist, 2nd Edition - Michael Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For decades fruit growers have sprayed their trees with toxic chemicals in an attempt to control a range of insect and fungal pests. Yet it is possible to grow apples responsibly, by applying the intuitive knowledge of our great-grandparents with the fruits of modern scientific research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;The Apple Grower&lt;/em&gt; first appeared in 1998, orchardist Michael Phillips has continued his research with apples, which have been called &quot;organic&#39;s final frontier.&quot; In this new edition of his widely acclaimed work, Phillips delves even deeper into the mysteries of growing good fruit with minimal inputs. Some of the cuttingedge topics he explores include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The use of kaolin clay as an effective strategy against curculio and borers, as well as its limitations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creating a diverse, healthy orchard ecosystem through understory management of plants, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to make a small apple business viable by focusing on heritage and regional varieties, value-added products, and the &quot;community orchard&quot; model&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author&#39;s personal voice and clear-eyed advice have already made &lt;em&gt;The Apple Grower&lt;/em&gt; a classic among small-scale growers and home orchardists. In fact, anyone serious about succeeding with apples needs to have this updated edition on their bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;" />
