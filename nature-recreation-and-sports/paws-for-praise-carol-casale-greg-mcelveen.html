  <title>Paws for Praise - Carol Casale, Greg McElveen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever learned a lesson from a dog or pet? Can a scruffy puppy teach us about God? Are all pet owners crazy? Can dogs be spiritual guides? &amp;ldquo;Paws for Praise&amp;rdquo; is a delightful set of stories, a pet devotional, written to introduce the reader to Cassy, an adorable Westie-poo terrier mix, who not only captured the author&amp;#39;s heart, but also opened her eyes to a new and deeper understanding of God. The life of Cassy, from rambunctious puppyhood to her savvy senior years, is written in a compilation of vignettes, filled with humor and thought-provoking comparisons, which contrast the dog/master relationship to the human/Master (God) relationship. One can sit and enjoy reading, laughing, and pondering these simple and heartfelt devotions written for every pet owner, past, present, and future. Cassy&amp;#39;s antics, her attachment to her prized blue ball, and her unconditional love and obedience toward her masters, are sure to be enjoyed by all readers; children and grown-ups alike. This is a true love story between the author and her pet dog, but more importantly, the author&amp;#39;s love for her creator, God. The spiritual applications in each tale are derived from the loyal unwavering devotion between humans and their best friend. This is an ingenious roadmap to a relationship with God. These anecdotes are sure to give you a glimpse into the trials and tribulations yes; but most of all, to the joys of pet ownership. You undoubtedly will identify with Carol Casale (aka CC) as she delightfully expresses the emotional ups and downs of raising her pet. In one incident, she wanted to strangle Cassy, and in another, she was distraught over the very thought that her precious fur baby had abandoned her, and in the process, could have ventured out into the creepy, snake-inhabited storm drain behind their home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
