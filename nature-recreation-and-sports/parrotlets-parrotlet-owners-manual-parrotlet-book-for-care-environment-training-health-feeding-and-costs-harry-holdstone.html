  <title>Parrotlets. Parrotlet Owners Manual. Parrotlet Book for Care, Environment, Training, Health, Feeding and Costs. - Harry Holdstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Parrotlet, or Pocket Parrot, is indigenous to regions of Central and South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean Islands. Their natural habitats are diverse, ranging from forests to semi-arid regions. They are the smallest parrot species in the world and are characterised by their beautiful plumage and big personalities!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will introduce you to the various species of these pint-sized parrots by discussing their appearance and biology, typical behaviour, reproduction and breeding, their feeding needs, socialisation and bonding, how to (try to) train them, and what makes these feathery bundles of energy entertaining and unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also tell you what you need to know in order to decide whether or not this is the pet for you and, if it is, where to buy one, how to select your bird or birds, what you need to buy before you bring it home, and how to take proper care of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner must know what Parrotlets require with regards to their environment. The cage and the necessary equipment is examined in this book as these all impact on the health and happiness of captive birds, especially active and intelligent ones like these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Parrotlet is susceptible to the same bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections and infestations that other birds may contract. Anyone who is serious about owning one needs to know what to look for and how to deal with common conditions. There is also information about diseases one can catch from a parrot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered in this book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Appearance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Basics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Behaviour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Biology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Bonding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Buying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Different types&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Feeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Hygiene&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Personality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Reproduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Settling in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Socialisation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;. and much more&lt;/p&gt;" />
