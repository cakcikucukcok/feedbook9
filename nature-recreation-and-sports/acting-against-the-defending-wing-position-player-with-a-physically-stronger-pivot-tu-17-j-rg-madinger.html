  <title>Acting against the defending wing position player with a physically stronger pivot (TU 17) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This training unit focuses on simple initial actions in order to gain positional advantage by having a physically stronger pivot play against a physically weaker defense player on the wing positions. The warm-up phase focuses on coordination. Afterwards, the players practice the first steps of the subsequent team play during the ball familiarization and goalkeeper warm-up shooting phases. The three subsequent offense exercises consist of the preparation and the final 1-on-1 play to get the pivot into a good shooting position. A closing game completes this training unit.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Coordination run (10/20)
- Ball familiarization (10/30)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/40)
- Offense/Individual (10/50)
- Offense/Small groups (15/65)
- Offense/Team (15/80)
- Closing game (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Training unit requirements: Highest requirements (competitive area)" />
