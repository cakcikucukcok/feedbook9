  <title>The Book on Games of Chance: The 16th-Century Treatise on Probability - Gerolamo Cardano, Sydney Henry Gould, Samuel S. Wilks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mathematics was only one area of interest for Gerolamo Cardano &amp;#8213; the sixteenth-century astrologer, philosopher, and physician was also a prolific author and inveterate gambler. Gambling led Cardano to the study of probability, and he was the first writer to recognize that random events are governed by mathematical laws. &lt;BR&gt;Published posthumously in 1663, Cardano&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Liber de ludo aleae&lt;/I&gt; (Book on Games of Chance) is often considered the major starting point of the study of mathematical probability. The Italian scholar formulated some of the field&#39;s basic ideas more than a century before the better-known correspondence of Pascal and Fermat. Although his book had no direct influence on other early thinkers about probability, it remains an important antecedent to later expressions of the science&#39;s tenets.&lt;BR&gt;" />
