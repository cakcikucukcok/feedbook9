  <title>There is no Map in Hell: The record-breaking run across the Lake District fells - Steve Birkinshaw, Joss Naylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1986, the legendary fell runner &lt;b&gt;Joss Naylor&lt;/b&gt; completed a continuous circuit of all &lt;b&gt;214 Wainwright fells&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Lake District&lt;/b&gt;, covering a staggering distance of over 300 miles - plus many thousands of metres of ascent &amp;amp;#8211; in only seven days and one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the know thought that this record would never be beaten. It is the ultimate British ultramarathon. The person taking on this superhuman challenge would have to be willing to push harder and suffer more than ever before. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is no Map in Hell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a man willing to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;b&gt;Steve Birkinshaw&lt;/b&gt; made an attempt at setting a new record. With a background of nearly forty years of running elite orienteering races and extreme-distance fell running over the toughest terrain, if he couldn&#39;t do it, surely no one could. But the Wainwrights challenge is in a different league: aspirants need to complete two marathons and over 5,000 metres of ascent every day for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a foreword by Joss Naylor, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is no Map in Hell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; recounts Birkinshaw&amp;amp;#8217;s preparation, training and mile-by-mile experience of the extraordinary and sometimes hellish demands he made of his mind and body, and the physiological aftermath of such a feat. His deep love of the fells, phenomenal strength and tenacity are awe inspiring, and testimony to athletes and onlookers alike that &amp;amp;#8216;in order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd&amp;amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
