  <title>Training of stem shot variants for back position players – decision-making TU (28) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This training unit focuses on improving stem shots. Following warm-up, the players repeat different stem shot variants during the ball familiarization phase. After a shooting competition and the goalkeeper warm-up shooting, the players practice these shooting variants by playing against an inactive defense player before they practice making stem shot decisions by playing against a more active defense player. In a series of shots and another individual offense exercise, the players subsequently practice the different stem shot variants in various situations similar to the real game. Finally, they implement the shooting variants in a 3-on-3 game.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Ball familiarization (15/25)
- Shooting competitions (10/35)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/45)
- Offense/Individual (15/60)
- Offense/Series of shots (10/70)
- Offense/Individual (10/80)
- Offense/Small groups (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Training unit requirements: Intermediate requirement (youth teams under 15 years of age and adult teams)" />
