  <title>The Impact of Cody Lehe - Jim Cooley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over one million young men and women play high school football in the United States each year. Many of these athletes will be diagnosed with a concussion. Others may suffer from a concussion but are not aware or do not report it. The story of Cody Lehe is a cautionary tale of the dangers of playing with concussive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written from the perspective of his physical therapist, The Impact of Cody Lehe examines Codys injury in an Indiana high school football game. Following only minor contact in practice four days later, a cascade of chemical events inside Codys brain altered Codys life forever.&lt;?p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insightful story offers a look into the sacrifices that Codys family has made to help him adapt to his new life, after injury. It also displays Codys determination and sense of humor as he struggles to stand, transfer, walk, and especially carve out a new identity for himself. Codys story is inspiring and educational. The goal of this story and of the Lehe family is to raise concussion awareness so that athletes can continue to safely play the sports that Cody loves. Codys warning to every young athlete is: If you ever have a headache (or other symptom) in a game (or practice), sit out, Bub, right now, or you are going to regret it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Proceeds from the sale of this book will help fund concussion education and research in honor of Cody Lehe.&lt;/p&gt;
