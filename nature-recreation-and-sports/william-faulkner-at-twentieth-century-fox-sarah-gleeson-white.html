  <title>William Faulkner at Twentieth Century-Fox - Sarah Gleeson-White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;William Faulkner at Twentieth Century-Fox&lt;/em&gt; is a scholarly edition of the five screenplays that Faulkner wrote while under contract to Twentieth Century-Fox during the mid-1930s, and another he wrote in the early 1950s. It includes a lengthy introduction that explains exactly what Faulkner did as a screenwriter at Fox while contextualizing his Hollywood labors in a broader genealogy of Hollywood screenwriting and practices of adaptation and collaboration during one of the most important eras of American film history. A brief essay also prefaces each of the screenplays, elucidating their evolution over various drafts and with various co-writers, including Twentieth Century-Fox&#39;s Darryl Zanuck. A draft of each of the six screenplays is also produced in full with scholarly annotations.
The edition makes available for the first time and in one volume Faulkner&#39;s Fox screen writings, and, with its scholarly apparatus, thus makes a valuable contribution to recent scholarship across a number of fields: Faulkner and film; literature and film/adaptation studies; cinematic modernism; and screenplay studies. It also foregrounds Faulkner&#39;s many significant collaborators, such as Zanuck and Howard Hawks, and therefore makes an important contribution to the history of Twentieth Century-Fox under Zanuck." />
