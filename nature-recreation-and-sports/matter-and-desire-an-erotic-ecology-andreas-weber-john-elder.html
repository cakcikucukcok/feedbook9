  <title>Matter and Desire: An Erotic Ecology - Andreas Weber, John Elder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Matter and Desire&lt;/em&gt;, internationally renowned biologist and philosopher Andreas Weber rewrites ecology as a tender practice of forging relationships, of yearning for connections, and of expressing these desires through our bodies. Being alive is an erotic process-constantly transforming the self through contact with others, desiring ever more life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In clever and surprising ways, Weber recognizes that love-the impulse to establish connections, to intermingle, to weave our existence poetically together with that of other beings-is a foundational principle of reality. The fact that we disregard this principle lies at the core of a global crisis of meaning that plays out in the avalanche of species loss and in our belief that the world is a dead mechanism controlled through economic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although rooted in scientific observation, &lt;em&gt;Matter and Desire &lt;/em&gt;becomes a tender philosophy for the Anthropocene, a &quot;poetic materialism,&quot; that closes the gap between mind and matter. Ultimately, Weber discovers, in order to save life on Earth-and our own meaningful existence as human beings-we must learn to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
