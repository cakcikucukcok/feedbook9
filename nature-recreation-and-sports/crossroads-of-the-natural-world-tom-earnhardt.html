  <title>Crossroads of the Natural World - Tom Earnhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this richly illustrated love letter to the wild places and natural wonders of North Carolina, Tom Earnhardt, writer and host of UNC-TV&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Exploring North Carolina&lt;/i&gt; and lifelong conservationist, seamlessly ties deep geological time and forgotten species from our distant past to the unparalleled biodiversity of today. With varied topography and a climate that is simultaneously subtropical, temperate, and subarctic, he shows that North Carolina is a meeting place for living things more commonly found far to the north and south. Highlighting the ways in which the state is a unique ecological crossroads, Earnhardt&#39;s research, insightful writing, and stunning photography will both teach and inspire.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Crossroads of the Natural World&lt;/i&gt; invites readers to engage a variety of topics, including the impacts of invasive species, the importance of forested buffers along our rivers, the role of naturalists, and the challenges facing the state in a time of climate change and sea-level rise. By sharing his own journey of more than sixty years, Earnhardt entices North Carolinians of every age to explore the natural diversity of our state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
