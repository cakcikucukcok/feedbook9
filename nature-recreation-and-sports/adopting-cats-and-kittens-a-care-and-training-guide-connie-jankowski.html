  <title>Adopting Cats and Kittens: A Care and Training Guide - Connie Jankowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That there is a tremendous overpopulation of cats in the United States is both common knowledge and a matter of grave concern. For many who would acquire a new pet, adoption is viewed as the most responsible means of finding the right cat. However, it is important to understand that if you decide to open your home to a stray or adopt from a shelter, an extra measure of patience, love and understanding is essential. Adopting Cats and Kittens: A Care and Training Guide reflects the special circumstances that surround the &quot;recycled&quot; cat and helps the new owner provide the cat with the secure, nurturing environment every pet deserves. This book offers sensible guidance on what your new cat needs to be happy and healthy and what to do to keep from contributing to the pet population explosion. Adopting Cats and Kittens is a book with a mission and a message of hope and concern for all who love cats and seek an end to their cruel treatment and abuse." />
