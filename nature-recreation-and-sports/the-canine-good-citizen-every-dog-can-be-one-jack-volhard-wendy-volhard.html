  <title>The Canine Good Citizen: Every Dog Can Be One - Jack Volhard, Wendy Volhard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;...purebred or mixed, with this book any dog can become a Canine Good Citizen.... The Volhards&#39;...approach to training, which they call the Motivational Method,...is designed to do just that motivate the owner and the dog. The Motivational Method is grounded on a thorough knowledge of how people learn and dog behavior. Since 1983 they have authored or co-authored four major books on dog training and teaching dog Obedience classes, and have produced four video tapes. I am...pleased that they have written this book on the Canine Good Citizen. I cannot think of anyone else who could have done a better job. This book contains everything the reader needs to know about training any dog to become a Canine Good Citizen. Still, there is much more the book shares a wealth of insights for the beginner, as well as the experienced dog person. The book&#39;s best feature is that it gives each person the means to tailor the training to the individual dog&#39;s character and temperament. It thoroughly explains what makes dogs different and how these differences dictate the approach to training that needs to be taken.&quot; James E. Dearinger, AKC Vice President, Obedience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The American Kennel Club&#39;s Canine Good Citizen program was developed to promote responsible dog ownership in a manner that would be easy for both dog and owner. Any book that promotes and encourages dog owners to participate is doing a public service, and this book does it well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This book is aptly named. Yes, every dog, both pure-bred dogs and mixed breeds, can be a good citizen if their owners care enough to make it happen. The key is to encourage dog owners everywhere to be responsible enough to make their dogs a pleasure to be around and able to handle most situations that they might be expected to encounter in everyday life.&quot; Robert H. McKowen AKC Vice President, Performance Events&lt;br&gt;A Howell Dog Book of Distinction" />
