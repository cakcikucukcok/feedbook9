  <title>I’M a Little Different - Pearl Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Out in the wilderness all around the world, animals look, sound, and act differently. For instance, theres one animal that hides in a shell. Theres another that has a very long nose and another still that gets very, very excited about receiving mail. Animals even live in different places: in trees, in the sea, and maybe in your own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im a Little Different is a book of rhyming verse. Each page describes another animal, but its up to you to figure out which one! Are you up to the challenge? Can you tell me which critter gets stinky when scared or which wild beast has a nose like a garden hose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Pearl Young uses the playfulness of poetry to teach children about rhyme and repetition but also about how its okay to be different. Just like animals in nature, people come in different colors, shapes, and sizes, too. Its good to be different, because being different makes you special, just ask a zebra!&lt;/p&gt;" />
