  <title>The Prairie Gardener&#39;s Go-To for Vegetables - Janet Melrose, Sheryl Normandeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the most common questions about growing vegetables in the prairies are answered in this first installation of the new gardening series, Guides for the Prairie Gardener.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often people think of vegetable gardening in the prairies as challenging, but certified master gardeners Sheryl and Janet are here to show you how rewarding it can really be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From planning to planting, they encourage you to take a hands-on approach with your prairie garden. They let you know when--and how!--to transplant your carefully nurtured seedlings in the spring, ways to shelter your plants from that inevitable July hailstorm, and how to determine how much irrigation is necessary in the arid prairie climate. They help you figure out if you should prune your tomatoes, how to hold up your pumpkins off the ground, and maximizing your harvest by planting in succession. And they show you how you can directly influence the quality of your produce, minimizing problems such as woody radishes, buttoning cauliflower, and split cabbage heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Q&amp;A-style resource covers all your most common questions about cultivation practices, preventing damage from frost, flood, and drought, harvest and storage, and they cover your questions about the veggies you love to grow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garlic, Onions, and Leeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lettuce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brassicas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots, Celery, and Beets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes, Corn and Other Warm Season Edibles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tomatoes and Peppers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squash, Pumpkins, and Cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;ve just acquired your first garden space, or you&#39;ve been growing vegetables for decades, gardeners are always learning and experimenting, building on the wisdom gained on their own or from others. With Sheryl and Janet on your team you&#39;re that much closer to achieving success in your prairie garden!&lt;/p&gt;" />
