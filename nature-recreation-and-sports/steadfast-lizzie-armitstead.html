  <title>Steadfast - Lizzie Armitstead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this brilliant and unique autobiography Lizzie Armitstead takes the reader to the heart of the most demanding of endurance sports and the challenges faced by one of its most gifted competitors: from sexism and the fight for equality, to doping and the incredible sacrifices and self-belief required to self-coach herself to world titles. Born in Otley, West Yorkshire, in 1988, Lizzie won her first medal in the Junior World Track Championships in 2005 after being talent spotted at school, before going on to win silver at the 2012 Olympics Games in London. Three years later she was World Road Race Champion and began 2016 as one of the favourites for a medal at the Rio Olympic Games. From the rolling hills of Yorkshire through to the treacherous climbs of the Vista Circuit in Rio de Janeiro - through setbacks, life lessons and ups and downs of a professional life in cycling - Steadfast is an intense and inspiring story of sporting triumph." />
