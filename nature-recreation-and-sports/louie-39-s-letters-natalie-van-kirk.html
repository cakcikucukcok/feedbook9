  <title>Louie&#39;s Letters - Natalie Van Kirk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This is a cat book, and just another cat book it is not. Louie (the cat) has written this himself. Louie tells of his adoption into the family, the last few years of his dads dying of cancer, his compassion for the terminally ill and the elders in nursing homes and assisted living. His letters have helped to brighten their days with laughter and let them know they are not forgotten.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Common day events become filled with life and colors, as Louie simplifies his love of life. It is as if we could see through this animals eyes, and the perception is different... and beautiful.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The book relates all of Louies life experiences, cloaked in a cat story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt; &lt;I&gt;LOUiES LETTERS&lt;/I&gt; will bring both tears and laughter. &lt;/P&gt;" />
