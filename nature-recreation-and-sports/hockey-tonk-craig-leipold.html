  <title>Hockey Tonk - Craig Leipold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hard-hitting, nonstop action (and that&#39;s just what happens off the ice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hockey is the fastest of all team sports?an emotional, exhilarating, and highly entertaining blend of speed, finesse, intensity, and bone-crunching physical impact. And the NHL&#39;s Nashville Predators are, in every respect, a team to watch. But the story leading up to, and through, the Predators&#39; triumphant first season is every bit as exciting as the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hockey Tonk&lt;/em&gt; tells of one man&#39;s dream of bringing a pro team to a city best known for its music industry. The journey from that dream to its fulfillment in an arena filled with 17,000 screaming fans is a story of vision, passion, hard work, perseverance, and commitment to long-term success. It&#39;s a story of teamwork and hard-nosed competition, both on and off the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few short years ago, the majority of Nashville, Tennessee, didn&#39;t know the difference between a blue line and a line dance. But now Music City has become a pro sports town, thanks to a fiercely competitive hockey team, its business-and community-minded front office, and fan support that, according to &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, is second to none.&lt;/p&gt;" />
