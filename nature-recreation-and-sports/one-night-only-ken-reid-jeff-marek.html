  <title>One Night Only - Ken Reid, Jeff Marek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get to know the men who fulfilled their childhood dream&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beer league to the minor league, hockey players from coast to coast often say they’d give anything to play just one game in the NHL. &lt;i&gt;One Night Only&lt;/i&gt; brings you the stories of 39 men who lived the dream — only to see it fade away almost as quickly as it arrived. Ken Reid talks to players who had one game, and one game only, in the National Hockey League — including the most famous single-gamer of them all: the coach himself, Don Cherry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a dream come true or was it heartbreak? What did they learn from their hockey journey and how does it define them today? From the satisfied to the bitter, Ken Reid unearths the stories from hockey’s equivalent to one-hit wonders in the follow-up to his bestselling &lt;i&gt;Hockey Card Stories&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
