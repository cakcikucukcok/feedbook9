  <title>The Anti-War Wargame: a Comprehensive Analysis of the Origins of the Game of Chess 1989-1990 - Henry J. Greenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of people love the game of chess, but most of them dont know how the game developed.
Henry J. Greenberg, one of the worlds leading chess historians, reveals how chess has its origins in a game called Chaturanga, which was designed during the reign of the Gupta Dynasty to commemorate Chandragupta IIs victory over the Sakas and to ensure the continuation of peace.
In this comprehensive history of the game, youll learn how:
	seeds for the origin of chess were planted during the flourishing of the Harappan civilization from 2,300 to 1900 B.C.;
	Chaturanga was specifically designed for the civilian population;
	rules were made so simple that even children could learn how to play;
	elephants play a critical role regarding when and why chess developed;
Greenberg also explains how chess historians can be classified into four types: Archaeologists, Linguists, Sinologists, and Oxfordites. Learn the characteristics of each, what they disagree on, and whether their views about the origins of chess hold any validity.
From the very beginnings of the game to Leonardo da Vincis invention of modern moves while living in Milan, Italy, youll be delighted with this comprehensive history of chess." />
