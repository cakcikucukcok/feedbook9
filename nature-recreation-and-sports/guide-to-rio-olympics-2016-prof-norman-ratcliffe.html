  <title>Guide to Rio Olympics 2016 - Prof. Norman Ratcliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Norman Ratcliffe has been a frequent visitor to Rio de Janeiro, arguably Brazil&#39;s most iconic city, for over twenty years. In this entertaining and comprehensive guide, he reveals the highs and lows of this marvellous city. Millions of visitors arrive in Rio de Janeiro every year for the New Year Celebrations, the legendary Carnival, Rock in Rio, the exquisite beaches and jaw-dropping landmarks. In summer 2016, Rio will take centre stage internationally as the host nation of the XXXI Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games. Rio is unique in many ways, and unlike most cities tourists will have traveled to before. Visitors need practical advice on how to plan and enjoy their holidays, to ensure that they avoid some of the possible pitfalls of such a trip. Guide to Rio offers sensible insider tips on how to get the best out of traveling to this busy, economically diverse city, whilst staying vigilant, healthy and safe. The realities of travelling to Rio can be overlooked by regular guidebooks; seasoned traveller Ratcliffe shares his local knowledge to reassure and inspire readers with advice on international and local travel, money, accommodation, food and restaurants, security, staying healthy and getting help as well as places to visit and enjoy. Guide to Rio will help make your visit to Brazil a wonderful experience by avoiding annoying incidences so that you can relax and have an unforgettable time." />
