  <title>Golf Can Be An Easy Game - Joe Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The material in this book may, at times, appear to be repetitious, but in discussing the golf swing from the different angles and aspects, repetition could not be avoided.
However, repetition has its merits, because it eventu¬ally brings one continually face to face with the same facts and fundamentals.
In all fields, facts and fundamentals do not change, and this is true in the golfing world.
Continued study and research have developed some new concepts—these concepts have produced clear-cut conclusions which are offered and presented herewith.
In addition to these conclusions, I have designed a practical method which can and will successfully de¬velop &quot;the art or knack of performance.&quot; Reread the text, restudy the pictures, and desired results will be produced.
In closing, let me wish &quot;that all your drives be long and true, and all your putts real short and few.&quot;
