  <title>Origami Humans Ebook - Marc Kirchenbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Some people are &quot;two dimensional&quot; in real life&amp;#8212;but not these origami paper people!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master paper artist Marc Kirschenbaum celebrates humanity with his whimsical new collection of customizable paper people. Everything you need is in this box! First, follow the step-by-step instructions to create a basic human form&amp;#8212;either &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;deluxe.&quot; Then, customize your person using the colorful papers that are included to create any of the 12 unique characters. Finally, add stickers to accessorize and give him or her their own unique personality. You can even attach a photo of your own face&amp;#8212;or those of friends, family, or favorite celebs&amp;#8212;to create amusing personalized origami art! The step-by-step instructions in the full-color book are incredibly easy to follow and allow you to create a dozen different characters with unlimited variations! All of the models can be either male or female. Free video instructions are available online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These models are great fun to fold with your friends and they make fantastic gifts for family and co-workers. You can even name them and create caricatures of famous people or people you know! This boxed kit contains the following characters, each of which can be customized in lots of different ways: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Dog Walker: There are many origami dog models&amp;#8212;only this one comes with a built-in leash!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Superhero: No capes! Okay, one cape. Up, up and away!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Construction Worker: Squeezing the attached drill makes the bit go up and down&amp;#8212;which is hilarious!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Businessperson: The attache case has a space for small papers (and other surprises you may wish to place inside)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Weightlifter: One barbell, or two? You decide. Masochists can add more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Baker: The apron is adjustable&amp;#8212;which is good news for bakers who like to sample their own wares!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Guitarist: A player who is at home with everything from classical to rock!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Skier: Once you attach the skis and poles, this character is ready to hit the slopes!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Tennis Player: Can also be a racquetball, squash, ping pong or badminton player!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Golfer: Can also be turned into an ice hockey or field hockey player!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Kayaker: The kayak has built-in oars, which your character really rows!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Baseball Player: Just like the game, this model is trickier than you expect!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
