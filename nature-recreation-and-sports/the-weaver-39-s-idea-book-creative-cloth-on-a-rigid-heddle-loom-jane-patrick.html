  <title>The Weaver&#39;s Idea Book: Creative Cloth on a Rigid Heddle Loom - Jane Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New and experienced weavers alike are always on the lookout for new weave-structure patterns. &lt;i&gt;The Weaver&#39;s Idea Book&lt;/i&gt; presents a wide variety of patterns for the simple rigid-heddle loom, accompanied by harness drafts for multishaft looms. The techniques include leno, Brooks bouquet, soumak, and embroidery on fabric. Each chapter contains weaving patterns along with swatches illustrating the techniques, accompanied by step-by-step photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is arranged by structure or type of weave, from variations on plain weave to doubleweave. With traditional patterns from around the world, bands, and fabrics woven on two double heddles, &lt;i&gt;The Weaver&#39;s Idea Book&lt;/i&gt; brings together a variety of ways to create exquisite cloth. Weaving tips and tricks help weavers at all levels achieve their textile dreams. In addition to pattern drafts, Jane offers project ideas that guide the reader through creating functional woven projects, from wearables to home decor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving, especially on rigid-heddle looms, is enjoying a resurgence, and contemporary weavers are in need of a book to bridge the divide between basic books and complex text designed for advanced weavers with sophisticated tools. Celebrating the immense potential for creativity possible with the simplest of tools, The Weaver&#39;s Idea Book eBook opens new avenues for exploration on both the rigid-heddle and multishaft looms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
