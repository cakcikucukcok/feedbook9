  <title>Do As I Say, Not As I Did - Michael N. Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LAUGH &amp; LEARN  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This bestselling book is a collection of amusing anecdotes and useful advice on a wide range of subjects: money, relationships, parenting, business, work, cars, food &amp; drink, life &amp; death, education, health, technology, media, aging, time, animals, baseball, sailing, sex, writing &amp; publishing and law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is the sad&amp;mdash;and also humorous and helpful&amp;mdash;story of what the author did wrong over a lifetime and what he learned from his mistakes, plus what he learned from observing other people, companies, animals and events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus often fantasizes about traveling back in time to warn himself not to make stupid mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says, &amp;quot;The ten-, twenty- and sixty-year-old me might have ignored the advice of parents, teachers, doctors and accountants&amp;mdash;but not the advice of me. If I talk to myself I have to listen. While technology will not yet allow me to go back and talk to myself, I can warn and advise anyone else who&amp;#39;s willing to pay attention. That&amp;#39;s why I wrote this book. And maybe by looking back I can influence my own future.&amp;quot;" />
