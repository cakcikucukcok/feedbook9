  <title>A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf: A radical nature-travelogue from the founder of national parks - John Muir, Terry Gifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Many a beautiful plant cultivated to deformity, and arranged in strict geometrical beds, the whole pretty affair a laborious failure side by side with divine beauty.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the second book in &lt;b&gt;John Muir&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s Wilderness-Discovery series. It is within this work that we are really given strong clues toward Muir&#39;s future trailblazing movement for environmental conservation, in such comments as &lt;i&gt;&#39;The universe would be incomplete without man; but it would also be incomplete without the smallest transmicroscopic creature that dwells beyond our conceitful eyes and knowledge.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muir&#39;s walk from Indiana to Florida was conceived in order to explore and study further the flora and fauna across states. He undertakes this alone, a dangerous choice perhaps so soon after the civil war, as many characters along the way forewarn. Indeed, Muir is threatened by a robber, and we see a new side to the quiet, lowly gentleman we know as he springs into self-defence mode with lightning initiative and remarkable courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the only facet of Muir&#39;s personality that is uncovered throughout this journey. He makes reference to feeling &lt;i&gt;&#39;dreadfully lonesome and poor&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, which is intriguing as his circumstances are self-sought: &lt;i&gt;&#39;Stayed with lots of different people but preferred sleeping outside alone where possible&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. He spends a substantial period of time struck down with malaria, which does not come as a surprise; he was covering many miles on an unsustainably meagre diet with thirst often quenched with swamp water or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join Muir in Kentucky forests, Cumberland mountains, Florida swamps and all the elegantly described trees, plants, creatures and rocks in-between. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; teaches us as much about Muir himself as it does the ecosystems in the wilderness across those 1,000 miles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
