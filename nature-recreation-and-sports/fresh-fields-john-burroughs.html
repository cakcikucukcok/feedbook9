  <title>Fresh Fields - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is John Burroughs&#39; 1887 work, &quot;Fresh Fields&quot;. It presents an authentic sketch of English nature and countryside in an accessible and charming way only Burroughs could achieve. This volume is highly recommended for lovers of nature writing, and it would make for a worthy addition to any collection. Contents include: &quot;Nature In England&quot;, &quot;English Woods: A Contrast&quot;, &quot;In Carlyle&#39;s Country&quot;, &quot;A Hunt For The Nightingale&quot;, &quot;English And American Song-birds&quot;, &quot;Impressions Of Some English Birds&quot;, &quot;In Wordsworth&#39;s Country&quot;, &quot;A Glance At British Wild Flowers&quot;, &quot;British Fertility&quot;, etc. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
