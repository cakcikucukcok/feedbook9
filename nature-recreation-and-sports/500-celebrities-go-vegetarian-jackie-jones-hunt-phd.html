  <title>500+ CELEBRITIES GO VEGETARIAN - Jackie Jones-Hunt PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr Jackie Jones-Hunt&#39;s paradigm shattering Animal Souls Serialization is pure gold, paradigm shattering and a deeply thought-provoking, potentially life-changing &#39;must read&#39;. This second generously sized instalment follows the first, namely the best-selling Proof Animals Have Souls. Each is receiving fantastic reviews including those from professors, animal charities, celebrities and authors. This serialization will be enjoyed by the environmentally aware or spiritually inclined and by all those who love their family pet or simply have an interest in animals. Readers will learn all animals whether two-legged, four-legged, tailed or winged survive death as a fact of nature and all will be reunited. In this yet again meticulously researched volume we continue to learn of the importance of compassion and non-violence to all fellow animals, here supported by over 500 of the world&#39;s greats who lived from the beginning of time to present day. These famous men and women teach the human animal that vegetarianism is the essential, fundamental, first step when beginning the spiritual journey. As each individual embraces the wider kinship of all-inclusive compassion this spiritual elevation will become globally recognized and integrated into global consciousness.  Here, we learn what the greats of the world have to say about the callously indifferent savage cruelty, humanity inflicts on vulnerable, harmless childlike animals. Our unquestioning acceptance leads in turn to human warfare, murder and violence. We learn that eating animals endorses their tortuous lives and slaughter in the billions every year, implicating many of us in their murder. We each have a shared responsibility for the mass slaughter of animals and animal flesh eaters unknowingly play a role in perpetuating the current, multi-million dollar animal slaughter industry. This encyclopaedic instalment has drawn together over 800 fantastic quotes from famous people throughout the ages to present day. This volume is a compilation of quotations from the most elevated thinkers and contributors to the world including spiritual teachers, prophets, authors and celebrities. They each advise us not to harm animals and to eat the healthier, non-violent vegetarian diet. They inform us that the consequences of this non-violence will have healthier, peaceful, positive repercussions for the human animal. It is incredible to read such words of love and wisdom that have so much in common, each is so obviously drawing from that divine spiritual font of all-inclusive love and wisdom. This book is great to dip into and read several quotations a day from the wisest and most famous people in history to present day.  They each remind us, that despite the differing intelligence in each animal, 2 legged human animal to 4 legged non-human animal, feathered, tailed, what is important is that each and every animal feels pain, and all fear and feel abuse, suffering, cruelty and murder, ranging from the smallest to the largest- including- lobsters, turkeys, chickens, cows, horses, dogs and cats- all fear and feel pain!! What a fantastic serialization!  This is a great book to dip into and use as a reference manual for all ages especially those who consider themselves to be environmentally aware and/or spiritual truth-seekers. One review in the American Journal for Spiritual and Consciousness Studies Inc., written by Paul D. Biscop states: &quot;I&#39;m also sure, however, that if animals could stand up and applaud, there would be a resounding noise of appreciation about the world for Jones-Hunt&#39;s work.&quot;" />
