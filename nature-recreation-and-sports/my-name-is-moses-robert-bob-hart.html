  <title>My Name Is Moses - Robert (Bob) Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We, Carrie and Larry, would like the readers of ` &quot;MY NAME IS MOSES&quot;, to know that all that Moses has related to you, is based on absolute fact.
	It is our priviledge to know Moses as a person with whom we share our lives. He is as close to being human as he can be, without his actually being so. He can uncannily tell us exactly what he wants, and what he expects from us, from hour to hour and day to day. He&#39;s now been with us more than nine years, and continues to be our wonderful companion. Sometimes at meal time he expects personal service, rising onto his four legs, and waiting to be picked up and carried by lying across Larry&#39;s two arms, then placed by his food bowl. Larry calls this &quot;Taxi service&quot;.
	Long ago, when Moses was one year old, Carrie felt that Moses needed a companion like himself, so one was acquired. Moses was visibly disturbed by our bringing in another so unlike himself -- he would have nothing at all to do with Carrie, who was responsible, for at least two weeks. Even to this day, he has not fully accepted Sam as his living companion.
	Sam&#39;s natural instinct is to be overly sociable, and Moses emphatically rejects such behavior, and obviously regards him as being too invasive into personal space. They are not pals at all.
	We speculate that in his afterlife, Moses may in fact return in human form. He certainly has strong leanings in that direction.
	Moses is the most intelligent of his kind that we&#39;ve ever known. He is our pride and joy every day of our lives. We are so very thankful that he came to us the way he did.
	When you think about it, no wonder Moses is so like a human---after all, the only family he has ever known since birth are us two, Carrie and Larry, in effect his true parents." />
