  <title>My Team Manchester United Wrapped Up In the Social History of Football - James Kenyon, Barbara Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book follows the local railway works football team Newton Heath FC from it&#39;s inception when they had poor grounds, boycotted the FA Cup, fought to enter the Football League. All this happened before their first brush with bankruptcy and finding a saviour in J.H. Davies who not only changed their name to Manchester United but built a magnificient stadium. His choice of manager was Ernest Mangnall who took the team to winning two League titles and the FA Cup. During the First World War a manager emerged who not only started his own youth policy before his retirement through ill health, but handed a team of young players all from the amateur ranks to the next manager who after a couple of years in the doldrums while the younsters matured became a team that people wanted to watch. In 1931 bankruptcy threatened again and the players could not be paid but this heralded the start of a new era which included the official launching of the Youth Programme: a bombed out stadium and the rise of a great team." />
