  <title>Performing Turtle Island - Jesse Rae Archibald-Barber, Kathleen Irwin, Moira J. Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“A valuable and timely collection.” —Alan D. Filewod, author of Committing Theatre 
Following the Final Report on Truth and Reconciliation, Performing Turtle Island investigates theatre as a tool for community engagement, education, and resistance.
Understanding Indigenous cultures as critical sources of knowledge and meaning, each essay addresses issues that remind us that the way to reconciliation between Canadians and Indigenous peoples is neither straightforward nor easily achieved. Comprised of multidisciplinary and diverse perspectives, Performing Turtle Island considers performance as both a means to self-empowerment and self-determination, and a way of placing Indigenous performance in dialogue with other nations, both on the lands of Turtle Island and on the world stage. 
“Brilliantly introduces pedagogies that jump scale; a bundling project for future ancestors revealing knowledges for flight into kinstillatory relationships.” —Karyn Recollet, co-author of In This Together: Blackness, Indigeneity, and Hip Hop
“An important resource for those who want to introduce or incorporate Indigenous artistic perspectives in their course or work.” —Heather Davis-Fisch, author of Loss and Cultural Remains in Performance 
“A very significant and welcome contribution to the growing body of work on Indigenous theatre and performance in the land now called Canada.” —Ric Knowles, author of Performing the Intercultural City" />
