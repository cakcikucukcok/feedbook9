  <title>Living Your Spectacular Life - Frosty Wooldridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book entertains, inspires and motivates. What I liked most about it: Wooldridge offers other adventure writers in each chapter to give you new ideas on living a spectacular life. If that means you enjoy a greater affinity to another writer, he gives you plenty of choices. He offers 12 concepts and practices that provide you with personal courage, self-confidence and empowerment. He offers you dozens of ordinary men and women living spectacular lives in various pursuits from world travel to growing a garden. He kept me reading through every chapter. 
Jake Hodges 
You learn and you grow from reading this book. The author grabs you by the seat of your pants. He takes you on a ride into self-confidence, self-acceptance and self-motivation. He shows you ordinary people breaking into spectacular lives through the principles he offers in his book. Effective, eloquent writing! 
Marie Jackson 
There must be a ga-zillion books showing you how to live a dynamic life. There are also thousands of therapists charging $100 an hour to move you into a productive life. Wooldridge takes you where you want to go much easier and more inspiringly than any therapist. He gives you the courage to get off your butt and discover what you truly loveand pursue it. 
Charles Hamilton 
This book gives you a better idea of who you are and where youre headed. Spectacular may not be a big enough term for this book. Stupendous may work better. By plugging into Wooldridges 12 points, you may lift off to Saturn if you are so inclined. All those people he writes about are just like you and me. If they can live spectacular lives, I can live a spectacular life.
