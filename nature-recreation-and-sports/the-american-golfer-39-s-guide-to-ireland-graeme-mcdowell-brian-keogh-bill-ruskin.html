  <title>The American Golfer&#39;s Guide to Ireland - Graeme McDowell, Brian Keogh, Bill Ruskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maybe the game of golf wasnt invented in Ireland but to most visitors it seems that way.  After all, there are more golf courses per square mile in Ireland than in any part of the world. A golfing visit to Ireland will be the trip of a lifetime for many reasons.
First, links courses sparkle like an emerald necklace around the coastline of Ireland.  It is subjective to pick the best from so many great courses but here are a few:  
Royal Portrush, Portstewart. Royal County Down, Baltray,  Portmarnock, The European Club, Old Head, Waterville, Ballybunion, Tralee,  Lahinch, Doonbeg, Connemara, Carne, Enniscrone, Murvagh, Ballyliffin and Rosapenna.
Second, the past two decades have brought world class resorts with the finest facilities and championship level courses, including The K Club, Lough Erne, Druids Glen, Mount Wolsely, Killeen Castle, Glasson, Galgorm Castle, Slieve Russell, The Heritage, Powerscourt, Adare, Fota Island, Dromoland Castle and many more.
Third, visitors can enjoy over 400 private golf clubs scattered throughout Ireland where greens fees offer excellent value and local members make you feel at home.
Not least, the 19th hole is a great opportunity to meet local golfers. An old saying puts it like this: There are no strangers in Ireland, only friends you havent met before.
The successes of Irish golfers on the international circuit has also put the spotlight on the great golf found throughout the Island. Padraig Harrington, Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke, Paul McGinley, Shane Lowrey and others have been not just successful competitors but wonderful ambassadors for Irish fun and hospitality.
I hope you and your friends will come to experience golf in Ireland for yourselves.  I can assure you a warm welcome and some wonderful memories.
