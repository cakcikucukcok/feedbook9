      <meta name="description" content="Rex is a German shepherd dog that was born with a deep awareness of his purpose in life and many things he would encounter on his journey.  As he dealt with the physical struggles of his body, he never veered far from his purpose with his human mom. Being a dog presented some limitations that required him to maneuver carefully through a human environment to achieve his goals.  The blending of the spiritual awareness of Rex and his human mom allows a special bond to form, resulting in a unique relationship that greatly benefited them both.  This book will take you deeper than just the events of daily life of Rex and will leave you looking at the deeper meanings of relationships with your animals and the humans in your life." />
