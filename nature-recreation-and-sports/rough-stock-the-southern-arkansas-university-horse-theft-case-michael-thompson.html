  <title>Rough Stock: The Southern Arkansas University Horse Theft Case - Michael Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rough Stock explores the theft of championship rodeo horses owned by students at Southern Arkansas University in November, 2011. The Investigation, Arrests, and Trials are covered with extensive documentation from court records. The case was disturbing due to the extreme animal cruelty inflicted upon the horses by the perpetrators, including a mother, her daughters, and various boyfriends. Uniquely, some following the case through social media were able to communicate with some defendants prior to trial, make a secret voice recording, and reveal details to the police. Social media was also important to the defendants and they pursued defenses online through their own social media sites. The case ultimately resulted in a modern landmark sentence of sixty years for the ringleader. The case reveals the unique criminal nature underlying some animal cruelty cases and argues for more involved prosecution." />
