  <title>Mysteries of the Universe and Planet Earth - Herman R. Habegger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You will find in Herm Habeggers book a challenge to your thinking about the Universe, and you will discover thoughts and facts which support faith in God the Creator. It is not often that someone will attempt to write such a treatise; but Herm has attacked this age old subject with thoughtful research and supporting material. It will allow you to study, think and draw your own conclusion as to the Author and Finisher of the Universe and Planet Earth. I encourage you to read and study Herman Habeggers book!&lt;br /&gt;

Herman has written a gem of a book! He shows us, non-Christians and Christians alike, that we have nothing to fear from the Bible AND Science. They, in fact, complement each other in our understanding of the world in which we live, and how it was formed. Our universe, Planet Earth and all living things have and are constantly changing. They are evolving according to God the Creators divine plan and nothing in science has disproved it, nor will. Through Science, the unfathomable complexity and magnificence is manifested. &lt;br /&gt;

Herman Habeggers work serves as a worthy introduction to some of the amazing marvels of our complex universe from the unfathomable vastness of the cosmos down to the subatomic level of the Higgs boson or God particle. The reader will come to appreciate our planets uniqueness and fine-tuning for the support of life, the advent of life from the irreducible complexity of the genetic code and other cell components working together, giving glory to the Creator. The elegantly designed structures of life forms, especially those of humans, are examples of divine engineering that are incontrovertible evidence for purposeful creation by God.&lt;br /&gt;
