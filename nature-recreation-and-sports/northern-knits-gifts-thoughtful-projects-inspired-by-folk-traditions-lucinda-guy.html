  <title>Northern Knits Gifts: Thoughtful Projects Inspired by Folk Traditions - Lucinda Guy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Northern Knits Gifts&lt;/i&gt;, knitwear and textile designer Lucinda Guy continues her exploration of folk-knitting traditions in this colorful volume of small projects and accessories. You&#39;ll learn some of the traditional knitting techniques of Scandinavia, Estonia, Iceland, and the Faroe and Shetland islands, through modern interpretations of such heritage techniques as twined knitting, two-color knitting, lace techniques, damask, fair isle, embroidery, and rya (knotted knitting similar to shag carpet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Northern Knits Gifts&lt;/i&gt; embraces the Danish notion of hygge - taking pleasure in comforting and cozy things, which is often associated with family and close friends. The 20 projects include mittens, socks, hats, scarves, and bags, and are perfect for wearing and gifting. Emphasizing pattern and color, these knitted designs also embody the Scandinavian aesthetic of making utilitarian objects beautiful as well as useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the book celebrates the specific wools traditionally used in each project. Immerse yourself in Lucinda&#39;s world as you enjoy thumbnail sketches of the history and folk culture surrounding each technique.&lt;/p&gt;" />
