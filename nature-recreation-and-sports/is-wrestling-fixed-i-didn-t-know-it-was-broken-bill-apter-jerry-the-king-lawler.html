  <title>Is Wrestling Fixed? I Didn’t Know It Was Broken - Bill Apter, Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Complete with exclusive photographs and sensational backstage stories, &lt;/i&gt;Is Wrestling Fixed?&lt;i&gt; is the much anticipated memoir from the biggest legend in wrestling fandom himself, Bill Apter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid growing up in New York in the late ’50s, Bill Apter fell in love with professional wrestling, and it wasn’t long before he was rubbing shoulders with the greats as a young reporter and photographer. Since then, he’s become the world’s best-known wrestling magazine personality, and he’s had professional and personal relationships with a who’s-who of the business, like Triple H, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Sting, and Ric Flair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his fun-loving memoir, Bill Apter takes us from the dressing rooms of the Bruno Sammartino era and the last days of the territories, to the birth of WrestleMania, the emergence of “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and the “Attitude Era,” to today’s WWE and superstars like John Cena, Daniel Bryan, and Roman Reigns. He also shares stories of his days photographing boxing and his interactions with stars like Muhammad Ali and other champions, and documents his appearances on the WWE Network and his work as editor of 1wrestling.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out which wrestler threatened him, learn about the dead wrestler who was really alive, and discover how hanging out with Andy Kaufman led to the comic’s notorious feud with Jerry “The King” Lawler. Still intimately involved in the wrestling business, the award-winning Apter has a story on everybody.&lt;/p&gt;" />
