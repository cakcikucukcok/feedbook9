  <title>Winning the NFL Way - Bob Lamonte, Robert L. Shook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being an NFL coach is the ultimate high-pressure job. Every Sunday a coach makes split-second decisions that will not only decide the fate of a game, but also his team&#39;s season and, ultimately, his own job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Mike Holmgren, Jon Gruden, John Fox, Andy Reid, and Mike Sherman -- top NFL head coaches whose careers rest on their ability to lead other men to win in the fiercely competitive world of professional football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary collaboration with their agent Bob LaMonte, each of these five coaches shares his leadership principles. LaMonte takes you behind the scenes, where you&#39;ll be a fly on the wall as these men reveal how to win beyond the X&#39;s and O&#39;s.  You will see how these successful leaders communicate with different personalities, develop vision, build trust in their people, and win loyalty, as well as overcome adversity and adapt to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their colorful and motivational anecdotes, you&#39;ll gain unprecedented insights into the minds of some of the best coaches today and valuable lessons on what it means to be a leader and a champion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
