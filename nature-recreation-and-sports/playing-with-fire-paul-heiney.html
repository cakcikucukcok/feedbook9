  <title>Playing with Fire - Paul Heiney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The blaze of a log fire on a cold night speaks to the heart in a way no other flame can. It has character and ever-changing form; it has vibrant colour and a balletic movement. Indeed, it was the flame that transformed the way life was lived on earth, but now that primary driver of evolution finds itself being extinguished in a modern world of microwaves, induction hobs and central heating. Gradually the flames are going out, as houses are now built without fireplaces, flats never had them, bonfires are banned, and schoolchildren are forbidden to use the Bunsen burner. But the sight of a flame remains as evocative as ever, and this how-to book will tell you how to bring fire back into your life.  It wants to inspire, and teach, and show the wonders that the magic burning flame can conjure up. It looks at the history of fire, and how it has been used in the development of man, but this book’s ambition is to fire the imagination and to leave its reader with a burning desire – to burn wood." />
