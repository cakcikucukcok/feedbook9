  <title>Tigres of the Night - Robert W. Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tigres in the Night is the true story of Juan and Amalia Arcos. For almost sixty years they have been lay missionaries, and friends of the Shuar Indians (known to history as Jivaro, the head-shrinkers of the Amazon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Shuar are a proud and were often a dangerous people who were famous for their vendettas, wars so violent that few men died a natural death. The shamans possessed spirit arrows they sent to kill enemies and roamed the night as tigres (jaguars), anacondas or deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book Review&lt;/b.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   The life of an Amazonian tribal community is brilliantly brought to understanding by the writings of Robert W. Howe as he followed the true story of Juan and Amalia Arcos, lay-missionaries and naturalists living in the rainforests along the Amazon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   In the mid 1900s Juan Arcos studied to become a priest under the direction of Father Peter Vosa, a man who had guided him for the past fifteen years of his life. With much prayer and careful consideration, Juan eventually decided not to become a priest. This decision was difficult for him, but God lead him to become a teaching missionary instead. He felt strongly that God wanted him to work with the local tribal people called the Shuar, because he had already learned their language as a child and felt connected on a spiritual level.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Juan and Amalia&#39;s goal was committed to lead a life dedicated to God and His people, the Shuar. They are simple, humble [yet exceedingly proud, my note] people. Being once thought as violent, they are in fact generous givers, welcoming and kind. In Howe&#39;s book he describes how the Shuar talk with the dead [really the spirits, author again], balance the needs of their men and women, keep peace or wage war, practice the ancient art of shamanic journeying, and learn from the sacred teacher plants (ayahuasca, datura, chicha, and tobacco) and many more tribal customs. He provides a view into the lifestyle of a culture from another time, in a distant place, that lives within the Amazon jungle.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &quot;Tigres of the Night&quot; really has some powerful messages that are most welcome at a time when we all need to feel a sense of strength, courage, healing, and love. While the book&#39;s vivid imagery invites us to experience the lush, tropical splendor of the Amazon Rain Forest, the real value lies in the rich wisdom imparted by the Shuar people.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is very appropriate to have a picture of a cascading waterfall on the front cover of this book. To the Shuar people, Waterfalls are sacred. If he needs strength, answers, or wisdom, a man will visit the waters in order to get in touch with his soul and find direction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robert W. Howe&#39;s writing tells of indigenous wisdom, different ways of life, and is especially focused for those who are already missionaries or those who wonder if God may be calling them. This book would also be a great resource for your pastor and your church&#39;s library. He created a masterpiece that lives on in one&#39;s heart for a lifetime. For the Shuar, their homeland is a place of wondrous beauty and great danger. It&#39;s a place where anacondas lurk in the rivers and jaguars prowl at night. &quot;&quot;Tigres of the Night&quot; is a book that tells their story. You will find that Tigres of the Night includes author&#39;s notes, an appendix and a bibliography for future reading.
