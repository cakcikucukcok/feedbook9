  <title>Bird Stories from Burroughs - Sketches of Bird Life Taken from the Works of John Burroughs - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is John Burroughs&#39; 1871 work, &quot;Bird Stories from John Burroughs&quot;. It is a fantastic collection of short descriptions - or, sketches - of the lives and habits of many birds commonly found in the U.S.. Profusely illustrated and written in simple but beautiful language, &quot;Bird Stories from John Burroughs&quot; will appeal to all lovers of nature writing, and is not to be missed by fans and collectors of Burroughs&#39; wonderful work. Contents include: &quot;The Bluebird&quot;, &quot;The Robin&quot;, &quot;The Flicker&quot;, &quot;The Cowbird&quot;, &quot;The Chipping Sparrow&quot;, &quot;The Chewink&quot;, &quot;The Brown Thrasher&quot;, &quot;The House Wren&quot;, &quot;The Song Sparrow&quot;, etc. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
