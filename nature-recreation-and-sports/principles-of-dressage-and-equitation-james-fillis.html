  <title>PRINCIPLES OF DRESSAGE AND EQUITATION - James Fillis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, I do not presume to discuss scientific subjects. I am simply a horseman who has been among horses for sixty years, who knows them, loves them, and is capable of reasoning about them.The fundamental principle of the studies which I submit to the public is that it is necessary for a horse to be correctly balanced and light in forward movements and propulsion, in order that the rider may obtain the most powerful effects with the least exertion. My method of equitation consists in distribution of weight by the height of the neck bent at the poll and not at the withers; propulsion by means of the hocks being brought under the body; and lightness by the loosening of the lower jaw. When we know this, we know everything,and we know nothing. We know everything, because these principles are of universal application; and we know nothing, because they have to be applied practically. Practice cannot be taught in a book; but I will try to set forth principles. Probably, I would not have had the boldness to do this, had not one of my pupils entreated me to write this book; because he had been greatly struck with the aptness of the explanation which I gave him respecting the details of the training lessons. In judging this work, I trust that my readers will give it the attention it deserves, as the result of sixty years? serious study and hard practical work.I crave the indulgence of the public, and the impartiality of my reviewers.
