  <title>Total Transition - Sandeep Pai, Savannah Carr-Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow the journey of a Canadian and Indian couple, Savannah and Sandeep, as they travel the world to capture the human side of one of the biggest energy transitions of our times – the global shift from fossil fuels to renewables.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this exciting and provocative new book, readers are taken into the homes of the coal miners who live and work in Jharia, a town in India that has been on fire for the past 100 years due to poor coal mining practices. Life in Jharia is a version of Dante’s inferno – 700,000 people live in the most unimaginable conditions. Yet even though residents of Jharia say they are dying slowly every day, they also say they’ll never leave. Almost 11,000 kilometres away, in the Canadian oil sands, workers and indigenous people similarly describe their complex relationship with the industry that employs them. Although fossil fuel extraction is harming the environment and impacting people’s way of life in the oil sands region, a much-needed shift to renewable energy could also leave communities without their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in the form of a travelogue, &lt;i&gt;Total Transition&lt;/i&gt; provides a whirlwind look at the global growth of renewable energy – highlighting exciting developments in solar and wind energy in Canada, India, Africa and Europe, and discussing hurdles standing in the way of a total transition. Energy experts and leaders of innovative renewable energy projects share hope and optimism about the future of fossil fuel workers and their communities in an increasingly renewable world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
