  <title>Best of Enemies - Padraig Lawlor, Barry Flynn, Philip O&#39;Callaghan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the 1950s and 1960s, boxers John Caldwell and Freddie Gilroy reached the very pinnacle of their sport and brought immense pride to Belfast and Ireland. This is their story of friendship and rivalry, of glory and pain, of riches and poverty. Belfast is world-renowned for her glovemen. Best of Enemies explores the careers of two of the city&#39;s finest exponents of the noble art of boxing. As friends, they won Olympic medals for Ireland. As professionals, they quickly became bitter adversaries. Their rivalry peaked when Caldwell claimed a share of the world bantamweight crown in a fight that had been promised to Gilroy. Thereafter, the Belfast fighters were on a collision course. The two finally met in a bloody battle in Belfast&#39;s King&#39;s Hall on Saturday, 20 October 1962. However, that brutal night did not resolve the question of who was the better boxer, which lingers to this day." />
