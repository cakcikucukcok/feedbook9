  <title>Shield of Life - Dan Frishling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Climate change...? Global warming...? Important issues for humanity to solve. But, is global warming really the most severe environmental concern facing mankind? How vital is it to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than a few degrees, and does the survival of humanity rest on achieving this goal? Or are there other environmental problems more dangerous to life, which are ignored by our political leaders and scientists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHIELD OF LIFE is the story of a world suffering from todays cavalier release of contaminated gasses into the atmosphere, the benign neglect of ozone-layer depletion, the careless embrace of genetic research gone awry, and a spoon-fed thoughtless television culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About thirty thousand years ago, the Neanderthals and other archaic human species were driven to extinction, and our ancestors, the Homo sapiens, inherited the earth. The SHIELD OF LIFE narrates the onset of a new era when we, Homo sapiens, are on the verge of being displaced by a more resilient species, the genetically engineered Bio-Gene sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year is 2138, and Earth is approaching ecological devastation. The ozone shield - which has made life possible - is slowly thinning, resulting in environmental calamity. Countless have perished, while others - afflicted by the suns radiation - have given birth to an exponentially growing number of mutated offspring, loathed by the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the threat of intensification of the suns malignant rays and the increasing mutant birth-rate, the influential media cartel, the powerful bio-pharmaceutical conglomerates and the shadowy Trade Societies have schemed, and successfully managed to manipulate mankind into undergoing a genetic procedure that will forever alter the human species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a small group of people, headed by Dr. Adam Cosmos and his brilliant fiance, Shannon, attempt to counter the conspiracy and preserve humanity, though aware that their lives will be in grave peril once their strategy is brought to light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
