  <title>Top Dog - Susan Gail Davison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of how we came to have a wonderful dog as part of our family. It&#39;s a story about  an orphan puppy that becomes top dog in a family that adopts him and loves him. &lt;br&gt;
The name Sgt Major is considered to be Top Dog in the army. The homeless dog in the animal rescue shelter needed a family and they esteemed him to be the best dog they could ever ask for. Our family made him a top dog because he was so loving and turned out to be the most rewarding of all the dogs we have ever owned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My children and I thought it was time to find a good home for our baby bunny rabbits that we had raised in our back yard. So we brought them to the local animal rescue shelter to be adopted by a family that wants to have a loving pet. That is where you go when you want to adopt a pet. We saw so many cats and dogs while we were there that needed to be adopted to a good and loving home.
 &lt;br&gt;
Our hearts were filled with compassion as we looked at each one. All the animals looked so sad and scared without having a good home of their own. &lt;br&gt;
It is a very happy ending when you can pick a lost animal to bring home. &lt;br&gt;
Everyone is happy. When we love animals they fill our hearts with joy. Animals are very happy too when they are cared for and loved by their owner&#39;s." />
