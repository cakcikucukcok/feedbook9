      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Fast-Track Triathlete&lt;/i&gt;, elite triathlon coach Matt Dixon offers his plan of attack for high performance in long-course triathlon—without sacrificing work or life. &lt;/b&gt;Developed for busy professionals with demanding schedules, the &lt;i&gt;Fast-Track Triathlete&lt;/i&gt; program makes your PR possible in Ironman®, Ironman 70.3®, Rev3, and Challenge triathlon in about 10 hours a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training for long-course triathlons once demanded 15-20 hours each week—on top of work, family, travel and other time commitments. For many, preparing for long-distance triathlon is more challenging than the race itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;i&gt;Fast-Track Triathlete &lt;/i&gt;opens the door to your best performance in full- and half-distance triathlons in half the traditional training time. Dixon’s laser-focused, effective approach to workouts, recovery, strength and mobility, and nutrition means you can prepare for triathlon’s greatest challenges in just 7-10 hours per week for half-distance and 10-12 hours per week for full-distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast-Track Triathlete&lt;/i&gt; includes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Dixon’s complete guide to creating a successful sport and life performance recipe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• How to plan out your triathlon training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Scaling workouts for time and fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Training and racing during travel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Executing your swim-bike-run and transitions plan on race day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 10-week off-season training program with key workouts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 14-week pre-season training program with key workouts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 14-week comprehensive race-prep full and half training plans with fully integrated strength and conditioning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixon’s first book, &lt;i&gt;The Well-Built Triathlete&lt;/i&gt;, revealed his four-tiered approach to success in all triathlon race distances. &lt;i&gt;Fast-Track Triathlete&lt;/i&gt; turbocharges Dixon’s well-built program so even the busiest athletes can achieve their long-distance triathlon dreams without sacrificing so much to achieve them. &lt;/p&gt;" />
