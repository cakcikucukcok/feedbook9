  <title>Wandering Ireland&#39;s Wild Atlantic Way - Paul Clements</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the spirit of the world’s longest coastal driving route, Paul Clements sets out to discover the real west of Ireland. Along the way he encounters memorable characters living on the Atlantic edge and presents a unique portrait of their lives. We meet the last man standing on a remote Galway island, listen to the banter at Puck Fair, and hear from a descendant of the original sixteenth-century wild Atlantic woman. Tagging along on his meandering journey is the swashbuckling presence of the Celtic sea god, Manannán Mac Lir. For his first travel book in 1991, Paul hitchhiked the same route. Now retracing his steps along the Wild Atlantic Way – this time by car and bike, on horseback and on foot – he looks at how Ireland has changed and realises everyone still has a story to tell. Laced with wry humour and endless curiosity, this is a distinctive mix of travel writing, social history and nature. Also by this author: ‘The Height of Nonsense: The Ultimate Irish Road Trip’ Praise for this author: “Stacks of free copies should be sent to all our tourist desks abroad.” – The Irish Times. “For sheer pleasure, nothing I read beat Paul Clements’ ‘The Height of Nonsense’.” – The Observer. “A compulsive, educational, laugh-out-loud read.” – Sunday Independent. &quot;A fascinating journey around the hidden corners of Ireland.&quot; – BBC Radio&lt;/p&gt;" />
