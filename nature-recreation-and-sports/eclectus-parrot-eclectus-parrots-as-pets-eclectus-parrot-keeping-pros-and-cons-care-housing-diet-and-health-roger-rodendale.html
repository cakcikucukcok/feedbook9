  <title>Eclectus Parrot. Eclectus Parrots as pets. Eclectus Parrot Keeping, Pros and Cons, Care, Housing, Diet and Health. - Roger Rodendale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Eclectus parrot is one of the most beautiful birds in the world. This species of parrots is known for the sexually dimorphic or the uniquely colored male and female bird. It has an interesting history where most scientists and explorers believed that the male and female were actually two different species of birds until the 19th Century! Today, it is one of the most popular birds found in captivity across the world. Known for its demeanour and intelligence, this bird is also a popular choice because of the spectacular coloration on its body.&lt;br /&gt; These birds depict very strong flock behaviors and will get very attached to the family that they are with. Unlike most parrot breeds, they will have strong bonds with the members of the family despite being kept in pairs. They are extremely intelligent birds that require a great deal of mental stimulation to thrive in captivity. Of course, their need for attention will keep their owners on their toes.&lt;br /&gt; This book describes in detail all the important things that you need to know about caring for an Eckie at home. Starting from the preparations that you need to make before you bring a parrot home, to breeding them, this book will cover everything.&amp;nbsp; The specific dietary requirements of the Eckie is also mentioned in the book to help you make sure that your bird is given all the nutrition that he requires.&lt;br /&gt; The book is an attempt to help you understand all the nuances of Eclectus parrot care. That will help you decide if you can provide for the parrot or not. You will also get a break up of the financial requirements of the parrot. The idea is to keep the book as realistic as possible to help readers realize that taking care of an Eckie is serious business.&lt;br /&gt; For those who decide to bring a parrot home, this book serves as an excellent reference point. It takes you through the different stages of your parrot&amp;rsquo;s growth so that you can be prepared at all times. The information provided is an accumulation of the experiences of various Eclectus owners and lovers. So, you can be sure that the information is not just authentic but also extremely practical. It is suitable even for beginner or newbies in the world of parrot care. The hope is to make your journey with your parrot a smooth and memorable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book contains all the information that you need on:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Choosing Eclectus Parrots&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Preparing your family for a new pet&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Preparing your home for a bird&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Dealing with your bird and other pets&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Feeding your birds&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Grooming your Eclectus Parrots&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Finding a good vet for your Eclectus Parrot&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Ensuring proper healthcare&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Bonding and training your Eclectus Parrot&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Costs of raising a Eclectus Parrot&lt;/p&gt;" />
