  <title>The Ogre - Doug Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some mountains are high; some mountains are hard. Few are both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of 13 July 1977, having become the first climbers to reach the summit of the &lt;b&gt;Ogre&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Doug Scott&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Chris Bonington&lt;/b&gt; began their long descent. In the minutes that followed, any feeling of success from their achievement would be overwhelmed by the start of a desperate fight for survival. And things would only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising to over 7,000 metres in the centre of the &lt;b&gt;Karakoram&lt;/b&gt;, the Ogre – &lt;b&gt;Baintha Brakk&lt;/b&gt; – is notorious in mountaineering circles as one of the most difficult mountains to climb. First summited by Scott and Bonington in 1977 – on expedition with &lt;b&gt;Paul ‘Tut’ Braithwaite, Nick Estcourt, Clive Rowland and Mo Anthoine&lt;/b&gt; – it waited almost twenty-four years for a second ascent, and a further eleven years for a third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ogre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, by legendary mountaineer &lt;b&gt;Doug Scott&lt;/b&gt;, is a two-part biography of this enigmatic peak: in the first part, Scott has painstakingly researched the geography and history of the mountain; part two is the long overdue and very personal account of his and Bonington’s first ascent and their dramatic week-long descent on which Scott suffered &lt;b&gt;two broken legs&lt;/b&gt; and Bonington &lt;b&gt;smashed ribs&lt;/b&gt;. Using newly discovered diaries, letters and audio tapes, it tells of the heroic and selfless roles played by &lt;b&gt;Clive Rowland&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mo Anthoine&lt;/b&gt;. When the desperate climbers finally made it back to base camp, they were to find it abandoned – and themselves still a long way from safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ogre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is undoubtedly one of the greatest adventure stories of all time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
