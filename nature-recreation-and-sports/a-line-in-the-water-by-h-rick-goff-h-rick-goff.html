  <title>A Line in the Water, by H. Rick Goff - H. Rick Goff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;H. Rick Goff&amp;rsquo;s gift for storytelling makes you feel as if you are right there in the boat with him. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A Line in the Water&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful book filled with faith, family, friends, and fishing. A fun and light-hearted read, perfect for transporting you to several prime fishing destinations across the country where Goff, a former military officer in the United States Air Force, was stationed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;m a novice when it comes to fishing, I found the heartwarming stories about Goff and his fishing buddies both comical and relatable.&amp;nbsp;Particularly touching was the story of his friendship with his neighbor, and their adventures in Tampa Bay. Great book for all ages, filled with important life lessons along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writer holds you captive as you venture with him chapter by chapter. It is the type of book you take on vacation to read and hope to never put down. It&amp;#39;s amazing how Goff shares each and every experience literally &amp;quot;reeling in&amp;quot; the reader with his storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is far more about the beauty of long-lasting&amp;nbsp;friendships and how they shape your life coupled with the love of fishing. I would recommend it to young and old alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
