  <title>Forman&#39;s Games - Lance Forman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On 6 July 2005, the world held a collective intake of breath as IOC president Jacques Rogge declared: &#39;The games of the 30th Olympiad in 2012 are awarded to the city of … London.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the images of jubilant crowds in the streets of Britain&#39;s capital, there were some, like Lance Forman, for whom those words spelled only dread and uncertainty. His 100-year-old, fourth-generation family business, H. Forman &amp; Son, was facing eviction to make way for the Olympic Stadium, and teetered on the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full, unexpurgated account of his fight to keep the firm alive, &lt;i&gt;Forman&#39;s Games&lt;/i&gt; lifts the lid on the fierce battle that pitched Forman&#39;s, the country&#39;s finest purveyor of smoked salmon, against the combined might of the UK authorities and the IOC in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics. It is a story of skulduggery and bullying mounted against 350 local businesses, employing over 12,00 people, who stood in the way not just of the world&#39;s most famous sporting event, but of an opportunity to develop the land on which they had successfully run businesses over decades.&lt;/p&gt;" />
