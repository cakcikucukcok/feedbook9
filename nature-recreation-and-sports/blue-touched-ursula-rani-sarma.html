  <title>Blue / ...Touched... - Ursula Rani Sarma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Blue three childhood friends try to make the most of their last year together in the isolated sea-side town in which they live. They study for their leaving certificate, go clubbing in the city and, in an effort to console their sense of worthlessness, they devise a deadly daily ritual. Together they jump from a point where the cliffs are forty feet above the ocean. In those panicked seconds, plummeting at full force towards the sea, Joe, Des and Danny believe that anything is possible, and that their hopes and dreams may just come true. When one day a mysterious black package is washed up on the shore, it seems as if all of those dreams and hopes are within reaching distance. Until everything falls apart and the unthinkable happens. In Touched Cora and Mikey yearn for Dublin, for a life without darkness, without secrets, without despair. Ensnared in their uncle&#39;s dishevelled pub in the &quot;crotch of the country&quot;, the young sister and brother make a pact to escape. Cora hides the darkest secret of all, one that dates back to the day of her tenth birthday, when the local doctor brought her to the beach alone for ice-cream.&lt;br&gt;Their flight to Dublin leads them straight into the hands of the street wise, money-hungry Macca, to a horrific crime and to a city that was far from the paradise they had dreamt about.&lt;/p&gt;" />
