  <title>Textile Collage - Mandy Pattullo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Textile artist and surface designer Mandy Pattullo marries fabric with collage techniques to produce beautiful pieces of art. In Textile Collage she shows a fresh way to use scraps and oddments of fabrics to create something unique and personal, while also being economical – perfect for those who have hoarded bits of fabric, trim and memory-filled domestic textiles over the years.
Chapter one covers &#39;Materials&#39;: collecting and sourcing fabric including unpicking and storing found fabric. In chapter two, &#39;Make&#39;, Mandy guides you through all the artistic and creative elements that you need to consider to create a beautiful collage. The following chapter &#39;Portray&#39; looks at piecing together a collaged portrait – human or animal – showing the figurative approach in collage work that includes transfer images and using found photographs. In the chapter &#39;Worn&#39;, the collage technique is used to embellish skirts, jackets and accessories. The final chapter &#39;Book&#39; looks at the fabric book as a receptacle for textile collage, with a range of approaches and forms explored.
This is a wonderful resource for all textilers looking to make the most of the found fabrics they love and fully explore the technique of collage with textiles." />
