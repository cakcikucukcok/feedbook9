  <title>Art Journey Portraits and Figures: The Best of Contemporary Drawing in Graphite, Pastel and Colored Pencil - Rachel Rubin Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Truth. Beauty. Experience. Emotion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The artists included in &lt;i&gt;Art Journey: Portraits and Figures&lt;/i&gt; say they have discovered all of these things and more through their work. Sometimes it&#39;s in the eyes. Or perhaps it&#39;s the hint of an expression that seems to beckon one closer, begging to share a secret. Maybe it&#39;s the tilt of a chin. Or the posture or stance of one&#39;s subject. But in a well executed portrait or figure? Something special, something unique that is invariably revealed--oftentimes about both the subject and the artist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Covering a tantalizing range of styles, the works within illustrate the many ways today&#39;s best artists choreograph shape, value, line texture and color into compositions that create drama, tell a story and pull the viewer in. Featuring unusual perspectives, enticing contrasts and other dynamic design elements, &lt;i&gt;Art Journey: Portraits and Figures&lt;/i&gt; delivers fresh inspiration for artists of every skill level and medium.&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Art and inspiration from 109 contemporary artists working in charcoal, pencil, pastel, colored pencil, scratchboard, pen and ink, and more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;107 masterful works--the best in portraiture and figure work--demonstrating a wonderful diversity of styles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expert tips and advice and insights into the stories behind art&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
