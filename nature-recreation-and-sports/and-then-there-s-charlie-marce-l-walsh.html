  <title>And Then There’S Charlie - Marce L. Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about a real dog named Charlie. His life was full of the usual occurrences in a dogs life, plus some. Charlie stood out from most dogs because he was a big, lovable huggy bear who made everyones life a little better by knowing him. Charlie worked
for many years as a therapy dog and made a big difference in the lives of many sick children and the elderly.
Charlie didnt have a mean bone in his bodylike all dogs, all he wanted was love. Charlie got it. Charlie was a lucky dog and those who knew him
were even luckier.
This story chronicles the adventures of Charlies lifefrom adoption to retirement and all the things in between. Children will enjoy getting to know Charlie and sharing in his adventures  chapter by chapter. Readers will also learn a bit about caring for an animal: the commitment, care,  and love animals need every single day.
At the old age of 15 (105 dog years, that is) Charlie passed away comfortably in his sleep while living in Cancun, Mexico with his Mom, Dad, and little brother Donovan.
If we all could live our lives like Charlie did, the world would be a better place.
