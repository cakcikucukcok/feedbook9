  <title>The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Toys and Games - Linda Garland Page, Hilton Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part oral history and part rule book, &lt;i&gt;The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Toys and Games&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous collection of memories of playing indoor and outdoor games; of making dolls, homemade board games, playhouses, and other toys--each with complete instructions and the flavor of southern Appalachia. Every toy and game has been tested by the Foxfire students and is devised to make or play yourself, without major expense, complicated parts, or electricity.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1985, the book includes familiar games like marbles, hopscotch, and horseshoes, as well as more obscure entertainments such as stealing the pines, crows and cranes, and thimble. Here, too, are instructions for constructing playhouses, noisemakers, puzzles, and whimmy diddles. The book also provides information on special games traditionally played on Sundays and holidays.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who are tired of worn-out batteries and electronic toys and for anyone curious about the playtimes of an earlier generation, &lt;i&gt;The Foxfire Book of Appalachian Toys and Games&lt;/i&gt; is a welcome and entertaining guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
