  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Don Miguel Ruiz’s The Four Agreements - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Don Miguel Ruiz’s The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom (A Toltec Wisdom Book) includes a summary of the book, review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Don Miguel Ruiz’s The Four Agreements was published in 1997 and remained on The New York Times bestseller list for seven years thereafter.  Ruiz, like fellow best-selling spiritualist author Deepak Chopra, had gone to medical school and became a doctor.  Also like Chopra, he would become disenchanted with the practice of medicine and sought to distill the wisdom of his ancestors.  
Chopra’s two biggest-selling books, Ageless Body Timeless Mind and The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, had appeared in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and would remain fixtures on bestseller lists for years to come.  While Chopra’s books were rooted in Transcendental Meditation, Indian natural philosophy, and the teachings of the Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi, Don Miguel Ruiz turned to his forebears, the Toltecs, an ancient civilization in Mexico from about 1,000 years ago.  The Toltec, Ruiz explained, were not so much a nation or race as a group of seekers of knowledge within a variety of disciplines who formed a society through which a communal exploration and conservation of spiritual knowledge and participation of ancient practices was possible." />
