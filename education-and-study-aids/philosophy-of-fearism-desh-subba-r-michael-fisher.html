  <title>Philosophy of Fearism - Desh Subba, R. Michael Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a new philosophy that takes a specific focus on see the critical historical and everyday importance of the nature and role of fear in human existence. We seem to be at a time when fear has taken the lead and we are not yet able to understand it and manage it well enough. It is causing major problems from wars, to terrorism, to deterioration of our institutions which are operating in a culture of fear. Our health is deteriorating under the excess of fear in the world today. No other philosophy, not rationalism, existentialism or pragmatism etc., has given this focus to fear as does the philosophy of fearism. It is an original synthesis of an Eastern philosophy of fearism (developed by Desh Subba, from Nepal) and a Western philosophy of fearlessness (developmed by R. Michael Fisher). The book brings forth their unified vision of a Fearless Age that awaits humanity if we better learn how to manage fear and teach about it with a new lens. Subba calls this a fearist lens, and Fisher calls it a fearlessness lens. Together, working independently for the past 20 years, they each have recently met to collaborate on this global project and movement as &quot;one philosophy of fearism.&quot; 
This is an essential text for leaders, students, parents, professionals and diverse people. Although it is not a self-help book, is goes deeper into helping our entire societies transform their relationship to fear and fearlessness. A must read for those who love philosophy and thinking critically about the 21st century." />
