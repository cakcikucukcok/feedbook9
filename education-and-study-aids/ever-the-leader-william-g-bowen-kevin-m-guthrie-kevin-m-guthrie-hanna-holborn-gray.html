  <title>Ever the Leader - William G. Bowen, Kevin M. Guthrie, Kevin M. Guthrie, Hanna Holborn Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ever the Leader&lt;/i&gt; gathers together selected speeches and writings from one of the great scholars and commentators of higher education. William G. Bowen&amp;#8217;s career at Princeton University&amp;#8212;from economics professor to provost to a sixteen-year tenure as president&amp;#8212;was marked by extraordinary accomplishments during times of great change, both at the university and in the country. But it was in Bowen&amp;#8217;s second act, as president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and founding chairman of ITHAKA, that he took the lessons he learned as a highly productive leader of one of the nation&amp;#8217;s most esteemed universities and applied them to a broader set of problems in higher education. This volume of work from Bowen&amp;#8217;s later career captures this expansion of his thought and influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprising remarks and articles on the subjects of university values, educational opportunity, college sports, technology, and Bowen&amp;#8217;s own colleagues and friends, &lt;i&gt;Ever the Leader&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a concise distillation of Bowen&amp;#8217;s research and thinking on some of the most urgent issues of the day&amp;#8212;it is a portrait of leadership in action. The selected papers, talks, and articles exemplify Bowen&amp;#8217;s commitment and singular ability to communicate strong, persuasive arguments for change, and to motivate others to engage with the truly hard questions facing higher education leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with formidable insights, &lt;i&gt;Ever the Leader&lt;/i&gt; will be required reading for university presidents, policymakers, and all those who carry on the struggle for equity and excellence in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;" />
