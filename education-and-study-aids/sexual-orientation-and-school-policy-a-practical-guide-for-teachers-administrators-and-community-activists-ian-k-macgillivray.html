  <title>Sexual Orientation and School Policy: A Practical Guide for Teachers, Administrators, and Community Activists - Ian K. Macgillivray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book helps the reader to understand and mediate the debates that arise when gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, intersex, and queer/questioning students and their families ask for equal treatment from the schools and are opposed by conservative parents. Sexual Orientation and School Policy is a case study of one school districts&#39; attempt to adopt and implement policies that include sexual orientation. This book describes the work of the Safe Schools Coalition who advocate and educate for equal rights for gay lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, intersex, and queer/questioning (GLBTIQ) students. Concerned Citizens, a group of conservative parents, opposed the inclusion of sexual orientation in the policies. Factors that either facilitated or impeded the implementation of the policies are highlighted, as are the strategies employed by the Safe Schools Coalition in educating opponents." />
