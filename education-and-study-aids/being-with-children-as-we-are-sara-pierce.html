  <title>Being With Children As We Are - Sara Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children actively co-create themselves in pursuit of answering the question, &quot;Who am I?&quot; while they come to terms with their developing soul and personality.    As parents and caregivers, we have the opportunity to become more self-aware as we support the child&#39;s process of discovering what it is to be human in this lifetime.   By modeling and instilling choice and our current understanding of self and other and while holding ourselves in curiosity and unknowing, we support the child&#39;s unique manifestation of self.   Ultimately, children seek feedback from their world that they are connected, that they are accepted as they are and know that they belong.   This book expresses our perspective on experiencing children as they are. The Learning and Behavior Pyramid encompasses and addresses the following four questions related to our development as humans of all ages:  What is it to be a conscious human? What is it to perceive as human? What is it to be human? What is it to act as human?  We invite you to join us in this adventure as aware stewards of our children and the children in our care.   Sara Pierce and Karen Sjostrom Hedger practiced in the field of early intervention for more than 25 years. Their teaching and writings inspired many children and their parents to become more of who they are." />
