  <title>Lonely Thoughts - Simon Peter Esaku</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simon Peter Esaku has introduced a reader friendly style in poetry in Lonely Thoughts: Poems about Life.  His poems are easy to read, interesting, entertaining, educational and relevant. He treats the reader to various ingredients of poetry and with varied themes, makes him or her identify with situations. 
The author draws his inspiration from personal experiences, observation and imagination. He is a blend of talent and school and university skills in poetry. Exposure from his work travels and journalism skills have added to the smoothness of his poems.    
Esaku is a journalist, photographer and author with World Vision in Kampala since 1997. His work writing news stories, features and books for the international NGO has taken him to most parts of Uganda and to the Dem. Rep. of Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Thailand. 
His stories and photos in magazines and websites abroad have raised millions of dollars for World Vision working in over 100 countries and employing 41,000 staff. Esaku is considered one of the best writers and photographers in the organisation.  
Previously, the author worked for the Ministry of Information as a features writer. He won the prize for the best AIDS features writer in Uganda in 1992. The Commonwealth Trust awarded him a four-month study tour in the UK in 1993.
Simon Peter Esaku was born in Kateta sub-county in today&#39;s Serere district in Eastern Uganda in 1957. He&#39;s the second born of eleven children of Mislam Atolong and Margaret Acobo. 
He attended Sebei College Tegeres for his O Level (1971-1974) and Boroboro Secondary School for A Level (1975-1976) where he studied History, Economics and Literature including poetry. 
In his first year in Makerere University in 1977, Esaku studied History, Political Science and Literature with poetry. He graduated in B.A Political Science and Public Administration in 1980. He trained in journalism in Uganda and in West Germany at the International Institute for Journalism. Now he is studying M.A in Mass Communication at Makerere University." />
