  <title>Faculty Development and Student Learning: Assessing the Connections - Gudrun Willett, Carol Rutz, William Condon, Cathryn A. Manduca...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Colleges and universities across the US have created special initiatives to promote faculty development, but to date there has been little research to determine whether such programs have an impact on students&#39; learning. Faculty Development and Student Learning reports the results of a multi-year study undertaken by faculty at Carleton College and Washington State University to assess how students&#39; learning is affected by faculty members&#39; efforts to become better teachers. Extending recent research in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) to assessment of faculty development and its effectiveness, the authors show that faculty participation in professional development activities positively affects classroom pedagogy, student learning, and the overall culture of teaching and learning in a college or university.&lt;/P&gt;" />
