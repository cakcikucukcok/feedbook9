  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Donald Trump&#39;s The Art of the Deal - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This is a &lt;i&gt;key takeaways&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;analysis&lt;/i&gt; of the book and &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; the original book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start Publishing Notes&#39; &lt;i&gt;Summary, Analysis, and Review of Donald Trump&#39;s The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt; includes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary of the book&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis &amp; Key Takeaways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed “About the Author” section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preview:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt; gives readers a comprehensive look at the author&#39;s life as a businessman. It is divided into three sections. The first section offers a detailed look at a single Trump workweek, the second section lists the business principles to which Trump adheres, and the third section contains Trump&#39;s autobiographical reflections on his early life and most notable business ventures. Although there is some debate about who wrote the bulk of this book, there is no doubt that it channels Trump&#39;s boisterous, success-obsessed personality: both people and building projects are described either as winners or losers, and everything Trump-related is given a positive spin, even if he actually received intense media criticism and scrutiny for his actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s workday usually runs from nine to five. He wakes up around 6:00 a.m. to start reading all the local newspapers, then spends most of the day making calls or attending meetings. During the week summarized in the book, he is deeply involved with matters ranging from the reopening of the Wollman Skating Rink, which Trump built in a matter of months for a New York City government that had spent a decade struggling with the project, to possibly purchasing a controlling interest in the Holiday Inn corporation in order to gain access to their casinos. &lt;/p&gt;" />
