  <title>Approaching Crisis of Global Cooling and the Limits to Growth - Shigenori Maruyama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are at the terminal point of the warm interglacial period, and the
next glacial age may anytime start. The first step of the global cooling is
predicted by the author to come in 2035, when the food production will
surely decrease. The population is expanding and the shortage of food
and drain of natural resources result in the limits to the growth of the
human society. It was predicted by the Rome Club (1972) that The Limits
to Growth would come in 2020. All these conditions together corroborate
to bring a severe crisis to human beings in near future. If the earth would
be meeting warming in near future as predicted by IPCC, then the crisis
would be mild.
However, it is not the case. The atmospheric temperature of the earth
will surely become cold, because most of major controlling factors of the
atmospheric temperature, i.e., solar activity, cosmic rays, and geomagnetism
are changing in a way to the cooling. The effect of carbon dioxide gas only
cannot be too much evaluated. The effort of decreasing carbon dioxide
gas is important in the sustainability of our limited resources, however, we
have to seriously consider the measures for the approaching crisis of global
cooling and the limits to growth." />
