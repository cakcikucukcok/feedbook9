  <title>Let Us Sum It Up - Catherine Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jolene is a working mother of three who loves her kids and wants them to succeed. Her son, Craig, and twins, Rebecca and Isabel, look up to their mother; they want to help her in any way they can. She does her best to make them understand how money works, because she knows thats an important skill to have in life. She sends them to the grocers and on other errands from time to time with a list and a budget, and she encourages them to put what they learn in maths class to good work. 
Maths, Jolene knows, can be a challenge for some kids. Textbooks are dry, boring, and more than a bit intimidating, and too many teachers just waffle on and on endlessly about sums and decimals and fractions and integers and quotients and the like without bothering to make it relevant or even interesting to students. But Jolene, like many mums, knows that kids are inherently keen to learn, so she thinks up clever ways to make them love using numbers. 
In this new, innovative approach to maths instruction, Catherine Daniel, an experienced accountant and teacher, weaves these lessons into a fictional story format. Now, readers can follow Craig, Rebecca, and Isabel as they learn that mastering numbers just makes life better. Before you know it, youll probably wish Jolene was your own mum  and youll find that maths can be fun, easy, and a powerful skill to master!" />
