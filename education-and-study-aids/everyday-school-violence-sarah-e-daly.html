  <title>Everyday School Violence - Sarah E. Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The book aims to discuss the issue of small-scale school violence. While school shootings and safety are of the utmost concern among teachers, students, parents, and the public, many children suffer the effects of everyday violence that affect the learning environment and the sense of safety in schools. Such violence can include bullying, threats, fistfights, theft, weapon-carrying, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It offers an overview of aggression and violence, including its theoretical causes and presentations, especially in the context of development and schools. It also outlines the effects of violence on schools and students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The publication is particularly unique in that it will encourage the reader to &amp;ldquo;slow down the violence&amp;rdquo; and evaluate it frame-by-frame. This technique, used by the author in consultation, has been effective in preparing school employees to address issues of violence, encouraging them to evaluate their own willingness to intervene, and identifying their own strengths and limitations. By insisting that they have a plan of action, the hope is that they will be better prepared when faced with student conflict, even in the absence of a school plan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Finally, the book discusses basic program design and implementation practices to assist school administrators and professionals to create a tailored program to specifically address their own schools&amp;rsquo; needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
