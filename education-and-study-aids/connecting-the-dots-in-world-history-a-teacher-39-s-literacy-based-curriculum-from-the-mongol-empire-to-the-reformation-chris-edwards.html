  <title>Connecting the Dots in World History, A Teacher&#39;s Literacy Based Curriculum: From the Mongol Empire to the Reformation - Chris Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;In his previously written articles and books, Chris Edwards has argued that Teaching should be considered a field that is separate from both the field of Education and from the content area fields. Teaching is a field which synthesizes content and method for classroom application. All of the other major intellectual fields have a canon of works which practitioners can learn from and add to, but Teaching does not. The Connecting-the-Dots in World History: A Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Literacy-Based Curriculum series changes this by showing how effective a teacher-generated curriculum can be. These books can inspire other teachers to create their own curriculums and inspire a change in the way that the public views teachers and teaching. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
