  <title>The Very Hungry Caterpillar in Tuscany - Enzo Catarsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The volume publishes some essays illustrating experiences which attempted to promote reading with very young children in nurseries and infant schools, as part of a project on the picture books by Eric Carle, a well-known American illustrator of children&#39;s books. In particular, this initiative took place during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, in a large number of nurseries and infant schools in some areas of Tuscany (Pistoia, Firenze, Grosseto, Livorno, Lucca, Viareggio, and the Empolese area). The main aim of the project, carried out as action-research, was to present the books of Eric Carle and investigate the level of understanding of the stories proposed by the famous illustrator. The specific goal of the project was to introduce teachers, educators, librarians and parents to the picture books written and illustrated by Eric Carle and translated into Italian.
Enzo Catarsi is director of the University of Florence Department of Education and Training Science and Psychology. He directs the «Rivista Italiana di Educazione Familiare» and is a member of the editorial teams of the journals «Studi sulla Formazione», and «Ricerche Pedagogiche». He is part of the scientific consultancy committee of the journal «Bambini» and directs the &#39;Bruno Ciari&#39; Study Centre. He deals with childhood and family pedagogy and storytelling and comprehension in early and later childhood." />
