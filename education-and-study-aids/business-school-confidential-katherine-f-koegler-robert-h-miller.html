      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Featuring an in-depth interview with the Director of Admissions at Tuck School of Business, ranked #1 by the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written for &lt;i&gt;students &lt;/i&gt;about to embark on this two-year odyssey, by students who have successfully survived business school, &lt;i&gt;Business School Confidential&lt;/i&gt; provides a comprehensive, blow-by-blow chronological account of the complete MBA experience.  Miller and Loucks have assembled a panel of recent MBA graduates from across the country, all of whom are in a prime position to offer realistic and informative advice on what business school is really like today.

The book also features interviews with top Fortune 500 CEOs including Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, Larry Bossidy, former CEO of Allied Signal; Vernon R. Loucks formerly of Baxter International and currently of Segway, Jim McNerney, CEO of 3M; and Edward Whitacre, Chairman and CEO of SBC, and with Kristine Laca, the Director of Admissions of Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, currently rated as the #1 Business School in the U.S. according to the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;.
