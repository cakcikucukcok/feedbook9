  <title>Magnificent Midnight’S Marvelous Memories - Tally L. Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tally was compelled to write this book to share her experiences with Therapeutic Horseback Riding. Tally had ridden horses since she was 4 years old and longed to have a horse of her own. Welcoming Midnight into her life was a dream come true for Tally. She conveys the story of the incredible 10  years she and Midnight shared together. An underlying theme of the book is the mindset of how there are infinite possibilities when one believes in oneself, and that ones greatest dreams can come true!

Tally has also been an enthusiastic horse lover as long as she could remember. She started Therapeutic Horseback Riding at the age of 4, and has been hooked ever since. This project combines two of her greatest joys, horses and creative writing. Along with her passion for horses and creative writing, Tally is currently in training to become a certified Sign Language Interpreter." />
