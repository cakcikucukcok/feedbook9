  <title>A Quality Life - Christine T. Seiler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What would a person profoundly affected by multiple disabilities including autism have to say if he could talk? How would he describe the details of his life? What would he say are his guiding principles in life? What would he say he has learned throughout his life? What advice would he have to offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Quality Life &lt;/i&gt;offers a peek into what one man, Cory, may have to say. It is a collection of stories about family, living with disability, and connecting with community. It includes stories written by Corys Aunt Chris, as well as stories written from Corys perspective as imagined by his Aunt Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Aunt Chris in this celebration of Corys life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...I read your book...I was warmed and inspired. One of the highlights of my life has been knowing, and knowing of, families like yours...I salute and honor Cory, his mother, you and all the other fine individuals who made his integrated life so much better than the one he would have experienced if he had been segregated. Thank you for sharing this important and insightful story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
