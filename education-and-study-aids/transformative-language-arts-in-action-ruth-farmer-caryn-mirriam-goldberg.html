In this landmark anthology, Transformative Language Artists share their stories, scholarship and practices for a more just and peaceful world, from a Hmong storyteller and spoken word artist weaving traditions with contemporary immigrant challenges in Philadelphia, to a playwright raising awareness of AIDS/HIV prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the stories, consider the questions raised, and find inspiration and tools in using words as a vehicle for transformation through essays on the challenge of dominant stories, public housing women writing for their lives, histories and communities at the margins, singing as political action, the convergence of theology and poetics, women&amp;#39;s self-leadership, embodied writing, and healing the self, others, and nature through TLA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anthology also includes &amp;ldquo;snapshots,&amp;rdquo; short features on transformative language artists who make their livings and lives working with people of all ages and backgrounds to speak their truths, and change their communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
