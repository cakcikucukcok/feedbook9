  <title>How to Teach Now: Five Keys to Personalized Learning in the Global Classroom - William Powell, Ochan Kusuma-Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, William Powell and Ochan Kusuma-Powell provide a practical map to navigate some of today&#39;s most complicated instructional challenges: How do you help all students succeed when every classroom is, in effect, a global classroom? And what does a successful education look like in a world that is growing smaller and flatter every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on research and years of experience in international schools, the authors identify five critical keys to personalizing learning for students who have wildly different cultural, linguistic, and academic backgrounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Focus on your students as learners through systematic examination of their cultural and linguistic identities, learning styles and preferences, and readiness.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Focus on yourself as a teacher and investigate your own cultural biases, preferred teaching style and beliefs, and expectations.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Focus on your curriculum to identify transferable concepts that will be valuable and accessible to all students and further their global competence.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Focus on your assessments to ensure cultural sensitivity and improve the quality of the formative data you gather.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Focus on your collegial relationships so that you can effectively enlist the help of fellow educators with different experiences, backgrounds, skills, and perspectives.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way to teach now is to focus on your students both as individuals and as members of a multifaceted, interdependent community. Here, you&#39;ll learn how to design and deliver instruction that prepares students not just to meet standards but to live and work together in our complicated, 21st century world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
