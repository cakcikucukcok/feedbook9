  <title>Teacher Leadership That Strengthens Professional Practice - Charlotte Danielson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every school relies on teachers who informally and voluntarily lead various efforts in the school. These teachers may not be &lt;i&gt;appointed&lt;/i&gt; leaders or &lt;i&gt;paid&lt;/i&gt; leaders, but they are &lt;i&gt;committed&lt;/i&gt; leaders: they see a need and they respond to it. What do these teacher leaders do that is different from the work of excellent teachers who are not teacher leaders? If we can articulate those skills, says Charlotte Danielson, then we can take steps to enable more teachers to develop those skills and be better equipped to tackle special projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teacher Leadership That Strengthens Professional Practice&lt;/i&gt; is designed to be a resource not only for prospective teacher leaders but also for administrators who want to better support the development of outstanding teacher leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers seeking to expand their leadership capacity will learn how to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* recognize an opportunity and take initiative,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* mobilize colleagues around a common purpose,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* marshal resources and take action,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* monitor and adjust the initiative,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* sustain the commitments of others, and&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* contribute to the learning organization.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administrators will find advice on how to cultivate, promote, honor, and empower teacher leaders--and how to work with them to successfully present innovations to the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this book gives individuals and schools a practical framework for tapping teachers&#39; leadership potential and marshaling their efforts to better educate students and create a stronger learning community. As Danielson convincingly shows, genuine teacher leadership is a powerful force for constructive change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
