  <title>Real Talk: Lessons in Uncommon Sense - Adolph Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Adolph Brown has been reviewed and rated as a top-ranked educator and trainer from America&#39;s best colleges and universities. He is in the top 1% of world-class scholar teachers based on teaching performance, teaching awards, published evaluations, newspaper write-ups, and other sources. Doc&#39;s lectures are often described as that once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a Master Teacher, Doc is a gifted scholar, explainer, enthusiast, communicator ? and yes, an entertainer. His ideas have been described as intoxicating as a new love.&lt;p&gt;
And possibly a brief quote about the book from Reg Weaver, former President of the National Education Association.  I would like you to add a brief synopsis of the book for the back cover as well.&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Dr. Adolph Brown believes, as I do, that every young person can
achieve. He is driven to reach out to youngsters who are falling and
failing. And he is inspired to explore ways to help all children reach
their full potential.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
Reg Weaver&lt;br&gt;
President&lt;br&gt;
National Education Association&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Although I believe that there is no one &quot;cookbook quick fix&quot; approach to teaching our young, this one book does a great job of helping adults bring out the teacher within us all.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
John Hicks&lt;br&gt;
Ret. Superintendent, Sussex County Public Schools&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&quot;I use this text to supplement my classroom lectures.  The &#39;lightness&#39; of the text helps my students understand that there are no pat answers or foolproof blueprints for teaching.  This book is easy-to-read, engaging, enjoyable, and also contains profound knowledge.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
