  <title>Alpha Beta Zero to Zillion Word Codes for Numbers - Dr Godwin Lekwuwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ABZZ word code system is a method that can be used to convert any given number to word code equivalents. With this method, any given number from zero to zillion can be converted to word codes. The principles of this method are explained in this book. This book also contains a thesaurus that gives two examples of easily derivable and meaningful word code equivalents of every number from 0 to 9,999. It is a forerunner to a proposed online thesaurus that would list word code alternatives of every number from zero to one billion (01,000,000,000). 
For centuries, people have been attracted to the idea of converting numbers to words. One of the major advantages of this is that people would be able to find meaningful word names for phone numbers, passwords, pin numbers, log-in numbers, access codes, etc. Other advantages include the ability to generate prospective number codes based on any words of your choice. Numerous other advantages and uses are elaborated in this book. 
Word code systems for numbers devised over the centuries have been cumbersome and difficult to use. This has limited their use in everyday life. The ABZZ word code system introduces a new, simpler, and user-friendly system of converting any given numbers to words and vice versa. The principles of the system can be mastered in a few minutes. Regular usage would engrain it as one of our basic thinking processes. The ABZZ is an idea whose time has come." />
