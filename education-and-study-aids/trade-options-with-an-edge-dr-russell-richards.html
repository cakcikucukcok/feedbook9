  <title>Trade Options with an Edge - Dr. Russell Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Would you like to have success in trading options much like the success of a casino that consistently grinds out profits each day? Casinos are successful because they have a definite probability edge on every gambling opportunity that they offer. They rely on the law of large numbers to guarantee that their probability edge will produce profits. When trading options, you can also do this if you have an edge. This book will show you how to get an edge in your options trading. Then, like the casinos, your edge will translate into small but consistent gains. The book will show you how to best exploit your edge, and it will guide you in the selection of the equity that you trade, selection of the strategy, selection of the strikes and expiration cycle, sizing and placing the trade, monitoring progress, and managing the trade. 
The book covers basic information about options including all of the common strategies, the option pricing model, and the greeks. It then discusses six sources of edge for sellers of option premium. Then it shows the reader how to select equities that take advantage of the combined edge, how to decide on the best strategy, how to determine the risk and to size the trade, how to place the order, and how to monitor and manage the trade. Each decision can be totally mechanical, based on the values of one or more metrics. And the software provided with the book computes all of the metrics that you will need. 
If you follow the approach described in this book, I believe you will be able to achieve profits of 1 percent to 2 percent or more each month in markets that are moving up, down, or going nowhere." />
