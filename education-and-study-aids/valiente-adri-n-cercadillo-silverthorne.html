  <title>Valiente - Adrián Cercadillo Silverthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Valiente is a ten-year-old boys account of his experiences walking the famous Camino de Santiago, also known as St. Jamess Way. 
It is a story of perseverance, stamina, and determination as he traverses eight hundred kilometers of wet and misty mountainous terrain and blisteringly hot plains from Roncesvalles, on the border of France, to Santiago, in the northwest of Spain. 
Since the Middle Ages, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world have hiked, cycled, or horse-back ridden to Compostela, the field of the star, and many books have been written about it, but rarely has such an experience been seen and told through the eyes of a child. 
During five adventure-rich weeks, Adrin learns history, local traditions, self-reliance, and responsibility and meets people from all walks of life who share their stories and their culture. He tolerates heavy rain, sore feet, pulled muscles, heat rashes, and the weight of a backpack on his back cheerfully and with fortitude. 
This inspirational book describes the adventure and accomplishment of a true valiente!" />
