  <title>Think Gen Why - Ryan Miller, Kyler Graff, J.  Eric Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Authors: Kyler Graff, Matthew Wood, Jesse Wright, Ryan Miller, Ethan Jones, J. Eric Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how different our world would be if our educational systems went beyond teaching the basics, and actually taught success skills for life?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six authors of &lt;strong&gt;Think Gen Why&lt;/strong&gt; asked themselves this question at a young age and they discovered a whole new way of thinking that was not taught in schools. They came together in their teens and 20&amp;rsquo;s to write this book because they are enthusiastic about sharing what they have learned and want to make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that the shortest path to success is to develop a greater sense of self-awareness and personal responsibility, and to learn how to think and make decisions by following the advice of people who have already succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their personal stories, each of these young men want to motivate and inspire their generation, and anyone else with an open mind, to get off the excuse train and start taking responsibility for the direction of their life. They want their readers to realize that if you want to change the direction of your life, you can. You do not have to be the same person tomorrow that you are today. All it takes is having the courage to let go of old ideas and try something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of their ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyler Graff: It is good to be different. Surround yourself with the right people. You have to make things happen. Get outside of your comfort zone. Pivot in a new direction. Be grateful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Wright: Have the courage to be yourself. Change your mindset, change your life. Raise your people standards. Be the leader of your own life. Develop a winning philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Wood: Change your story, change your life. Forgiveness is the ultimate solvent. Identify your why. Turn your bricks into bridges. Be grateful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Miller: Have an end goal in mind. Create a plan and take action. Overcome the wobbles. Ditch your excuses. Keep your eyes on your goal. Stay Calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan Jones: Be open to making changes. Commit to personal growth. Be a coachable person. Develop a healthy mindset. Take responsibility for your outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Eric Wright: Cultivate a family environment. Double down on what you are good at. When the going gets tough, get focused. Turn challenges into opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
