There are around two hundred creative writing exercises to help in what Gary calls word fitness along with reflective notes on major writing areas, like poetry and fiction, along with the performing area, building up to what it takes for a writer to get published. This textbook reflects the major achievements of the author as a teacher-writer from founding major areas and degrees to being asked to give guest appearances whether as a teacher, writer, or both. What sets this textbook apart from others on the same subject is primarily the authors background reflected both in the notes and all the exercises for people to try to develop the what, who, and how of their own work in the field of creative writing." />
