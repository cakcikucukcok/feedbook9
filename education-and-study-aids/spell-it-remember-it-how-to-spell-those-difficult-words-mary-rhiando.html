  <title>SPELL IT - REMEMBER IT - How to spell those difficult words - Mary Rhiando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;How d&amp;rsquo;you spell &amp;hellip; ?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; is a question asked by many people of all ages ever since first we held pen and paper.&lt;br /&gt;
During the world&amp;rsquo;s earlier days this was understandable for few could read, libraries were private and reference books were scarce. Not so today. Many English Language books are available via the internet and word processors have spell checks, and yet, still, the question is heard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our teachers taught us to sound out the required word but, invariably, the difficulty is caused by just a few letters, especially in words with similar sounds, for example, does the &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; come before the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or is it I-E? You only have to look at the words RECEIVE AND BELIEVE to see where the difficulty lies for younger readers. There is difficulty too, with same sounding words as AFFECT and EFFECT, or, BREACH and BREECH leading to hesitations on correct choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim of this book is to help young memories achieve the correct re-call. This demands memorable at-a-glance constructs. As such in creating this volume, SIMPLICITY has been the author&amp;rsquo;s purposeful guideline&amp;nbsp; Herein you will find words in the following categories to help you arrive at the correct spelling:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GENERAL&amp;nbsp; MISSPELLINGS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;DOUBLE LETTERS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;EI&amp;rsquo;s and IE&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PUZZLING SOUND-ALIKES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
- all arranged alphabetically for ease of lookup.&lt;br /&gt;
