  <title>Education, Education &amp; Education - Mohamed Sannoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is bringing many experiences and especially of thoughts in education from around the global, politics and religion within different and multicultural settings but all focusing on understanding the purpose of God&#39;s world. For those who are atheist or have never attempted to know anything about God especially when they are teachers or if they are politicians and banking on atheist ideologies of &quot;giving the people what they want, even when not good for them&quot; and they will vote you in, you will find this book although very irritating but educational and thought provoking. Teachers are seriously advised to think twice before being forced into teaching ideologies that are not substantiated with written facts that are always referred to as references; otherwise they will find themselves in the job of keeping somebody in political position, which is considered as employment seeking position. Are you ready for this?" />
