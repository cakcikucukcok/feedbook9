  <title>Behavior Solutions for the Inclusive Classroom: A Handy Reference Guide that Explains Behaviors Associated with Autism, Asperger&#39;s, ADHD, Sensory Proc - Beth Aune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHY won&#39;t he stay in his seat? WHY does she flap her hands? And WHAT should I do?? As inclusion becomes the norm in general education, teachers are faced with behaviors they have never seen before. Special needs educators may recognize the telltale symptom of a sensory need or a textbook-case of an avoidance behavior, but this is all new territory for the general crowd!  Written by Director of Special Education Peter Gennaro, occupational therapist Beth Aune, and special needs mom and advocate Beth Burt, this book illuminates possible causes of those mysterious behaviors, and more importantly, provides solutions! Teachers can quickly look up an in-the-moment solution and learn about what the child is communicating, and why.   The authors collaboratively address problem behaviors such as:  Out-of-Seat Behaviors Fidgeting Hand-flapping Covering Ears Hiding or Running Away When Upset Putting Head Down or Shutting Down Difficulty with Class Work and Homework Losing Materials and Missing Assignments Poor Handwriting Not Following Directions Saying Rude or Inappropriate Things Clothing Issues Difficulty Making Decisions Excessive Talking Laughing Excessively or Being Silly Little or No Eye Contact Temper Outbursts And many others!  Teachers, it&#39;s possible to accommodate learning differences and sustain a positive learning environment for ALL students. This book is a must-have for every inclusive classroom!" />
