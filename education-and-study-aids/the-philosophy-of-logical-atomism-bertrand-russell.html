  <title>The Philosophy of Logical Atomism - Bertrand Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bertrand Arthur William Russell,18 May 1872-2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic and political activist. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist. In the early 20th century, Russell led the British &quot;revolt against idealism&quot;.He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore, and his protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century&#39;s premier logicians.With A. N. Whitehead he wrote Principia Mathematica, an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay &quot;On Denoting&quot; has been considered a &quot;paradigm of philosophy&quot;. His work has had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics." />
