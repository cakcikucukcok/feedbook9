  <title>Teaching for Educational Equity - Jane A. Beese, Jennifer L. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teachers and school leaders are confronted by various issues pertaining to social justice every day. This volume will help school leaders to handle these issues ethically, and is intended to be used by administrators for the professional development of teachers, teacher leaders, and aspiring principals. This volume can be also be used in the higher education classroom in order to prepare current and aspiring administrators to lead for social justice. This volume utilizes the case study approach, which has been found to &amp;ldquo;sharpen problem-solving skills and to improve the ability to think and reason rigorously&amp;rdquo; (Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2013). This volume includes cases pertaining to race, class, gender, sexual orientation, discrimination and harassment, culturally responsive pedagogy, et cetera. Each case requires the reader to look beyond the facts, by providing guidance on current research and policy guidelines. Each case provides the reader with additional information that will assist them in making informed decisions. Additionally, each case provides facilitators with guiding questions to assist them in their pedagogy and for subsequent class discussion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
