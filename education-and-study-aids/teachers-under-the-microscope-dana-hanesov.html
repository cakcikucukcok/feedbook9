  <title>Teachers Under the Microscope - Dana Hanesová</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book offers a detailed and systematically processed excursion into research on the teaching profession. For her comparison of research on teachers in several central European as well as Western countries, the author used a three-dimensional analysis of research into the teaching profession, based on three conceptual themes: chronology of research studies and their categorization in terms of topics and methodology.
The diachronic view enabled the author to capture the changes and trends in teacher research at two key stages. The problematic pre-democracy period is described very objectively and correctly in the cultural-historical and political context of such conditions, in which the pedeutologic research was carried out. The author has managed to capture the key historical moments and especially their political and ideological context that severely interfered with the concept and results of pedeutologic research and determined its direction and published outputs. Socio-political transformation after 1989 not only affected the educational system and education reality, but created new challenges and opportunities for research on the teaching profession. (A. Seberov, reviewer)
The author presents the findings and analysis of how the research on teachers developed, not only its themes and methods, but particularly major changes in pedeutological thinking and independency of research. (B. Kascov, reviewer)" />
