  <title>The Game of Life and How to Play It - Florence Scovel Shinn, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this transformational classic, Florence teaches the power of positive thought. She explains how our thoughts and words affect the experience we have in our daily lives, and uses concrete examples to show how we can use them to bring more of what we want into our lives, including abundance, love and success. A wonderful and simple-to-follow book on the power of right thinking. This little book has inspired thousands of people around the world to find a sense of purpose and belonging. Whatever we send out into the world will eventually be returned to us, which means that if we give love, we will be loved, but if we hate we will in turn feel hated. Through what we give and receive, we shape our reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The book includes the following chapters:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;The Game&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;The Law of Prosperity&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;The Power of the Word&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;The Law of Nonresistance&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;The Law of Karma and the Law of Forgiveness&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;Casting the Burden Impressing the Subconscious&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;Love&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;Intuition or Guidance&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;Perfect Self Expression or the Divine Design&lt;br /&gt;
# &amp;nbsp;Denials and Affirmations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Florence Scovel Shinn&lt;/strong&gt; was a woman ahead of her time. To many, she is considered to be among the likes of James Allen, Wallace D. Wattles and Napoleon Hill. She had the ability to explain her success principles and how they work in an entertaining and easy-to-read style. She can be considered one of last century&amp;#39;s most popular success teachers.&lt;br /&gt;
Florence Scovel Shinn was born on September 24, 1871, in Camden, New Jersey to Alden Cortland Scovel and Emily Hopkinson. She had an older sister and a younger brother. She was educated at Friends Central School in Philadelphia. She later studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts from 1889 to 1897. While there, she met Everett Shinn, a painter of impressionistic canvases and realistic murals. They married shortly after Florence graduated from the art academy. The Shinns moved to New York where both pursued their separate careers, Everett in the theatre while Florence did illustrations for children&amp;#39;s literature in magazines and books.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1925, Florence decided to publish her first book &amp;#39;The Game of Life and How to Play It&amp;#39;. After unsuccessfully finding a publisher for her work, she published it herself. Her second book, &amp;#39;Your Word is Your Wand&amp;#39; followed in 1928 and her final book &amp;#39;The Secret Door to Success&amp;#39; was published in 1940 shortly before her death on October 17, 1940. A fourth book, &amp;#39;The Power of the Spoken Word&amp;#39; is a compendium of her notes, gathered by one of her students and published posthumously in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;" />
