  <title>The Veteran Next Door - Randall Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Veteran Next Door is a compilation of stories from the Nationally broadcast radio show of the same name. 
The stories are from survivors of World War II. From a Jewish girl being given away at age 2 to save her from Auschwitz, fighting in Bougainville, and Guadalcanal, the experience of being black in our army and navy during this time period. From love stories to fighting across Europe and even being captured on the first day of the Battle of the Bulge, seeing the new German jets shoot down the B-17 flying in front of your own Flying Fortress, earning as many medals as Audie Murphy and not being awarded the Medal of Honor, and being surrounded by sharks for 5 days, being on board a ship that is breaking in half in a typhoon. And coming home to a small Tennessee county that has been taken over by a corrupt political machine. All true stories about our Veterans of World War II, their heartbreaks, and their accomplishments told by the Veterans themselves." />
