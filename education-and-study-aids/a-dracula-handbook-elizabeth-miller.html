  <title>A Dracula Handbook - Elizabeth Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A DRACULA HANDBOOK
&lt;p&gt;
A Dracula Handbook provides succinct and accurate information about Dracula. Written for a general readership, the book should appeal to aficionados, students and the just-plain-curious. Using question/answer format, the book covers a range of topics: the origins of the vampire myth; the life of Bram Stoker, author of Dracula (1897); the novel, its genesis and sources; the historical figure (Vlad the Impaler) whose nickname Stoker borrowed for his Count; an examination of the connection between Vlad and Count Dracula; the phenomenal impact the novel has had since its publication; and an overview of interpretations of the book. Also included is a comprehensive reading list.
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the many questions that are directly answered in the book:
&lt;p&gt;What are the roots of vampire lore?
&lt;p&gt;How did vampires move from folklore to literature?
&lt;p&gt;What do we know about the actual writing of Dracula?
&lt;p&gt;Where did Bram Stoker find his information about vampires?
&lt;p&gt;Are there any autobiographical elements in Dracula?
&lt;p&gt;Did Dracula originate in a nightmare?
&lt;p&gt;What do we know of the relationship between Stoker and his wife?
&lt;p&gt;Did Stoker die of syphilis?
&lt;p&gt;How did Count Dracula become a vampire?
&lt;p&gt;Does Count Dracula have any redeeming qualities?
&lt;p&gt;How was the novel Dracula received when published in 1897?
&lt;p&gt;What did Stoker himself say about the novel?
&lt;p&gt;Why did Stoker name his vampire Dracula?
&lt;p&gt;Why did he select Transylvania as the vampires homeland?
&lt;p&gt;How much did Stoker really know about Vlad the Impaler?
&lt;p&gt;Was Vlad ever associated with vampire legends?
&lt;p&gt;What are our main sources of information about Vlad?
&lt;p&gt;Why do many Romanians consider Vlad to be a national hero?
&lt;p&gt;Which of the Dracula movies is the best adaptation of Stokers novel?
&lt;p&gt;What impact has Dracula had on subsequent vampire fiction?
&lt;p&gt;Why does Count Dracula have such enduring appeal?
&lt;p&gt;How do Romanians feel about Dracula tourism in their country?
&lt;p&gt;Is there a real Castle Dracula?
&lt;p&gt;What are some of the interpretations of Dracula?
&lt;p&gt;Is Dracula a classic?
&lt;p&gt;And many, many more! Depending on the complexity of the questions, the answers range from 5-6 lines to several pages. At the end of each chapter there is a shortlist for further reading. At the end of the book there is a comprehensive Bibliography." />
