  <title>Economic Prosperity and Space Development - Michael G. Baran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been over two years in the making.  While the title may appear to be specific to Economics and Space Development I have been sure to include the human element as well as consider environmental concerns. 
  I feel out of necessity it is essential something be done to prevent our world economy from running the risk of falling into a depression. Whereby the middle class and the poor would see their positions decline, which is already happening to some extent.  Politicians, business leaders,  and economists appear to be in a tough position, with little room to manoeuvre, with respect to revitalising the world economy. As well, there may not have been much focus yet on developing new strategies to bring about economic recovery. Since the focus to date appears to be on regaining economic stability. I feel what I have to offer, which may not be the ultimate or only solution, may at the very least stimulate some thoughtful discussions on how to improve the economic stability and perhaps return to some economic growth.
  &quot;Economic Prosperity and Space Development&quot; is essentially about how we can improve our current world economic malaise by looking at Space Exploration and Development as a way to exploit our Solar Systems  and the Galaxy&#39;s wealth. I have related the advent of man&#39;s expansion into the Galaxy in relation to the historical exploitation of the America&#39;s by European Nations and the resulting accumulation of wealth and generation of economic prosperity.
  I begin by documenting the poor economic situation the world is in. I have obtained and reported economic data from the IMF, the World Bank, Government Agencies, and recent News Reports. The main direction these reports take is that the National and City governments and their respective budgets appear to have debt risk especially  in the current economic environment. As well many Industries are finding their markets lacking growth or their markets are at risk.
  I have also included a section on the environment which is bound to be detrimentally  affected should the economy continue to falter.  This at a time when we appear to be making some progress in waste processes at the city and industrial level.
 As to financing this proposed expansion into Space I detail in the book how the G20 community and the World Bank should set up  long term financing along the lines of the various programs the World Bank is currently involved with. But , I imagine on a much larger scale. Due to scope of the financial outlay I also recommend the Space Development is organised along the lines of Economic Communities  (EU , NA, AP , etc) rather just the individual Nation states. I provide examples of recent World Bank financed programs that have been implemented.
 Then finally I detail how our existence on earth is subject to catastrophic events. Asteroids, Climate change, changes in magnetic polar locations. While we hope that our existence on earth should be free from trouble for the next few thousand years at least. We just do not know when to expect the next occurrence. Having technologies developed that would allow the transport of a good portion of the populace and nature would help alleviate that risk." />
