The stories can be used as language lessons on their own, or as part of a course with other language books and methods. All topics are presented in an original, highly creative, literary manner, and will definitely stimulate conversation between tutors and clients. Paul&#39;s natural talent for writing and describing people, places, and things shows clearly in each story. The stories are a great reading experience for native English speakers too, simply based on their well-written, poetic content.&quot;" />
