  <title>Why Are Students Not Learning on the School Bus? - Keshia L. Gaines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;SoWhy Are Students NOT Learning On The School Bus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Keshia L. Gaines, students should learn from academic content on the school bus and other unique learning areas (the bus stop, cafeteria, playgrounds, bathrooms, academic clothing, etc.). The key to improving Americas educational system, Gaines believes, is to allow students to learn outside the classroom. Since students are not meeting academic expectations in the general classroom, it is important to consider all methods and areas for students to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gaines founded Bus-stop 2 Bus-stop, LLC and created the Bus-stop 2 Bus-stop learning method to help students increase academic achievement in fun, innovative ways. Th e idea behind the Bus-stop 2 Bus-stop learning method is that students will be exposed to academic content starting at the school bus stop. Students will continue to be exposed to academic content throughout their school hours until they get dropped off at that same bus stop at the end of the school day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is designed for use in various education courses, educational leadership positions, and for general reading by anyone who is worried about the future of our children and educational systems. For entry-level students in education, this book provides insight and new ways to improve academic achievement in America. This book is also appropriate for various upper-level courses because of its research components, references, discussion questions, and journal activities . The purpose of this book is to explain the Bus-stop 2 Bus-stop learning method and to ultimately improve the current educational system in America. &lt;/p&gt;" />
