  <title>Reading with Writing in Mind - Nancy Charron, Marilyn Fenton, Margaret Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Good writing begins with good reading. This book is written on the premise that students must embrace reading as a part of the full process of good writing. It may be used by classroom teachers (Grades 6-12) individually or collectively as members of a professional learning community, by pre-service teachers in a literacy course, or by other educators working to support literacy in the classroom. Interdisciplinary discussions relate to all types or genres of reading and writing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book offers practical lessons and ideas for teaching and motivating &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;learners using Universal Design for Learning principles. Formatting provides additional ideas for challenged students, including students with special needs, accelerated learners, and English Language Learners, and is aligned with Common Core State Standards for content subjects as well as for language arts. It takes ideas that were formerly reserved for the upper echelon of students in English language arts and reformulates teaching approaches to reach students across the learning spectrum and in all disciplines. All teachers need to be involved in raising the literacy bar, and this book provides activities and strategies for use in the classroom that can promote success for all learners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
