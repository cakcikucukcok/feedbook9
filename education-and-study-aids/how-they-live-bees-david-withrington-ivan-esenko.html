  <title>How they live... Bees - David Withrington, Ivan Esenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From 6 years old&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come and discover the wonderful life of bees! Learn about their environment, their physical features, what they eat and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The “How they live” collection is a must-have for children and other members of the family who are eager to learn about nature and animals while having fun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The European Honey Bee (&lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;) lives in a large community called a colony. This consists of tens of thousands of worker bees, a few hundred to a few thousand drones, and one single queen. The bees make the honeycomb their home. It is a wax formation made up of hexagonal cells, which serves as a cradle to the members of the bee colony, while it is also a space for storing honey and pollen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE COLLECTION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection &quot;How they live...&quot; is about wild creatures and their relation to our lives and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &quot;How they live...&quot; series : &lt;br/&gt;• How they live... amphibians&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... birds&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... owls&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... reptiles&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... rodents&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... predators&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... No joke animals&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... Birds and nestboxes&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... Ladybirds&lt;br/&gt;• How they live... Dragonflies&lt;br/&gt;• ... and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivan Esenko&lt;/b&gt; presents the world of nature and invites the reader to learn more about the world that we are part of. His camera is his most faithful companion and its lens particularly likes to ‘capture’ those animals that live in close quarters to man. We take them so much for granted that we no longer seem to care for them. Ivan is their voice, he has become their ‘personal’ photographer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Withrington&lt;/b&gt; from Britain has spent most of his professional life working for the official agency, Natural England, where he was initially Author/Editor and latterly Senior Freshwater Adviser. He has a particular interest in birds and butterflies. He has many contacts across Europe through his voluntary work for youth and environmental conservation, including friends in Slovenia, a country which he has visited 34 times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE PUBLISHER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okaši is a Slovenian publisher with a vibrant programme.&lt;br/&gt;At every turn, nature reveals its new face and discloses a myriad of secrets. This is why we have devoted a special place to it in our publishing house. We are the creators of books that delight curious children and their parents in their discoveries of nature: in the home garden and the nearby park, but also further afield, in the fields and forests. &lt;br/&gt;At Okaši we keep pace with the times which is why have embarked upon several electronic editions of our books. We have added sound to these publications and hence a new dimension to the contents already there." />
