  <title>Remedies for Saving Our Youth in Today’S Troubled Society - Rusty Skipper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written for the benefit of humanity so the future of our existence would have a better chance of moral ethics and longevity. Whereas it would keep the mind in an elevated state, the spirit would be at ease, and the soul would prance at its owners demand. The body itself will resemble perfection.
The material deals with your character, your personal growth as a human being, decision-making, education, responsibility, and staying focused, just to name a few. When I was scribbling these thoughts on paper, I knew for certain that my life had transitioned far better than I expected. And if there was no other way that I could contribute to society, I knew dedicating my mind, my love, and my life would seal the deal." />
