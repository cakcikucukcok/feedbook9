Jean-Paul Sartre was a French writer, philosopher and political activist. He was a leading figure in the existentialist philosophical movement, and participated in the French Resistance during the Second World War. In 1964, he became the first person to ever turn down a Nobel Prize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Nausea &lt;/i&gt;in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
