  <title>Engaging Young Children - Nóirín Hayes, Margaret Kernan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the theory and processes that inform daily practice with young children in early childhood education and care settings. It offers a clear overview of the historical developments of early childhood education policy and theoretical thinking in Ireland, within an international context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It reflects on the rapid worldwide changes in the lives of parents and young children and takes on the question of how to provide quality childcare and education for your children.  It emphasises the concepts of the child as an active agent in his or her own development, it introduces the concept of a nurturing pedagogy, and highlights the fact that bringing up children is a social endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book analyses and critiques early childhood policy development and implementation in Ireland while complimenting developments such as Siolta &amp;ndash; The National Quality Framework and the National Framework for Early Learning. It contextualises international research findings on young children&#39;s development and learning; and the role of practitioners and the critical importance of the learning environment as applied to children&#39;s everyday experiences and setting practice in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In summary, this book focuses on the centrality of the child in the learning process as well as on the critical role of the adult in early childhood pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
