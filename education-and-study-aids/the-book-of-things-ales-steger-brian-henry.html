  <title>The Book of Things - Ales Steger, Brian Henry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;From his first book of poems, &lt;I&gt;Chessboards of Hours&lt;/I&gt; (1995), Ale&amp;#353;&amp;#160;&amp;#352;teger has been one of Slovenia&#39;s most promising poets. The philosophical and lyrical sophistication of his poems, along with his work as a leading book editor and festival organizer, quickly spread &amp;#352;teger&#39;s reputation beyond the borders of Slovenia. &lt;I&gt;The Book of Things&lt;/I&gt; is &amp;#352;teger&#39;s most widely praised book of poetry and his first American collection. The book consists of fifty poems that look at &quot;things&quot; (i.e. aspirin, chair, cork) which are transformed by &amp;#352;teger&#39;s unique poetic alchemy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Translator &lt;B&gt;Brian Henry&lt;/B&gt; is a distinguished poet, translator, editor, and critic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From Publisher&amp;#8217;s Weekly:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Steger&amp;#8217;s efforts sometimes bring to mind such Western European figures as Francis Ponge and Craig Raine, who also sought to make household things look new and strange. Yet Steger brings a melancholy Central European sense of history- his objects tend to remember, or cause, great pain: &amp;#147;It pours, this poisonous, sweet force,&amp;#8221; Steger writes of &amp;#147;Saliva,&amp;#8221; &amp;#147;Between teeth, when you spit your own little genocide.&amp;#8221; (Nov.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From Guernica, a Magazine of Art and Politics:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is a rare treat to have an English translation before the ink has dried on the original. By which I mean, a mere five years after the book&amp;#8217;s Slovenian publication, Brian Henry has brought these poems to life for those of us not lucky enough to read Slovenian. Henry&amp;#8217;s translations are impressive for sheer acrobatics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
