  <title>Lucy, M’Amie - Nolanne O’Hair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucy Audubon lived and died in the shadow of her husband, the famous American artist and naturalist, John James Audubon. Few people today know her name, or that she made it possible for Audubon to complete much of his work. In &lt;i&gt;Lucy, Mamie,&lt;/i&gt; author Nolanne OHair captures the spirit of Lucy Audubon and vividly portrays the era in which she lived. 
Timeless and enduring, this fictionalized account explores the life of an indomitable woman who struggles to maintain her family through continual hard times yet always provides the encouragement her talented, idealistic husband so desperately needs. &lt;i&gt;Lucy, Mamie&lt;/i&gt; follows Lucys life beginning 1802, when her family moves to America from Derbyshire, England, and to her marriage in 1808 at the age of twenty. It depicts the details of Lucys life as she watches her husband transform from a peculiar artist and naturalist to a world-famous figure.
This portrait not only recounts Lucys struggles and adventures; it unveils her heart and mind, brings her out of her husbands shadow, and gives rich insights into the life and times of a capable, resourceful pioneer woman." />
