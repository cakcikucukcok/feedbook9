  <title>Running Away to Home - Ruby O’Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1966 and seventeen-year-old Kathleen is escaping her past on a crowded bus with nothing but her suitcase and hope. Intent on finding new adventures, Kathleen is more than ready to leave segregated Memphis behind and embrace exciting New York City. But as the bus arrives, Kathleen soon realizes that big city excitement comes with big city fears.
Kathleen, who has just buried her mother, is propelled forward through her fears by a burning desire to create a new beginning. But it is not long before the innocent teen is forced to mature as cultural differences, a sexual awakening, lies, disappointments, and love greet her on her coming-of-age journey. Influenced by her belief that life is like a baseball game, Kathleen does her best to navigate through every challenge, the dynamics of her relationships, and the chaos surrounding the sixties. But when a chain of events instigates a shocking discovery, it forever changes how Kathleen views life, herself, and love.
Running Away to Home is a coming-of-age tale about a teens quest to find herself as she journeys from her southern Memphis roots to fast-paced New York during 1960s America." />
