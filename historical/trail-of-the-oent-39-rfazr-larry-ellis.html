  <title>Trail of the Oent&#39;rfazr - Larry Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hunter Johnson is about to get a sign that will change his life forever. It begins with eighteen consecutive nights of the same disruptive dream, followed by eighteen seemingly random words, and ends with a telephone call from a non-human voice mandating his death.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hunter and his son, Scott, have been recruited to take part in a strange, otherworldly duel to the death, and they have no choice but to press on at great peril to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So begins the partnership of Hunter and Scott, with a time-traveling alien named LEAX. Their mission is to locate a powerful new time travel technology hidden in the past along Route 66. They begin in Lupton, Arizona, and soon learn of the time-traveling Oentrfazr race and their evil adversaries, the Bstri..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They search Route 66 for living, alien mapRocks and in the process become time travelers themselves. They visit Arizonas lost past, including the site of a shootout with the Clantons before they met the Earps at the O.K. Corral and a visit to a city where the federal government intended to detonate twenty atomic bombs. Their four hundred-mile journey across Arizona reveals more about history and time travel than either could imagineand more about their pasts and futures than they can possibly understand or believe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
