  <title>With Strength and Spirit - Frank Ingels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is a story of real people, who lived many of the adventures told within,
over the period 1937 to 1969.  It is a story of human dedication, tremendous
perseverance, and heroic achievement.  You will read about a news broadcast
team, Frank and Laura Marshall,  in the early days of radio.  You will go with
them as they travel around the globe seeking to document the turbulent days of
World War II, the atomic age cold war, and the conflicts that followed.  Their
joys and heartaches will be yours to experience as they deal with the greatest
technological project of history and the spy that gave it all away.
&lt;P&gt;One of Laura&#39;s younger brothers, Jamie, becomes a key factor in the development
of aircraft engines for the Navy.  His talents are enormous and lead him into
dangerous situations that are unique, but were all too real.  His involvement
with the Navy&#39;s Special Operations, leads him behind enemy lines more than
once.  His missions are simple, ferret out the secrets of the German engine
technology and the scientists responsible for their successes.  Jamie
represents many unsung heroes of our nation.  His experiences will fascinate
you.
&lt;P&gt;Jamie&#39;s wife, Betty, was the emerging business woman during this tumultuous
period in our history.  She and Jamie built a successful motorcycle business in
response to the war needs of America&#39;s allies.  Her journey was made with
frustration and difficulty as her tenacity and her capability overcame the
obstacles which a male-oriented society had created.  Her rise to success was
in response to America&#39;s needs of the time.
&lt;P&gt;You will live the life of a fighter pilot on both sides of the world as you meet
and travel the adventures of Charles, Laura&#39;s youngest brother who joined the
Navy on his seventeenth birthday and on the eve of catastrophe.  Through
Charles&#39;s eyes you will learn the history of naval aviation from the beginnings
of World War II and through the development of the jet age.  You will fly with
him in crisp, exciting major air battles of The Battle of Britain, WWII and the
conflicts that followed, Korea and Vietnam.  His maturity, both as a pilot and
as a human, will be both your joy and sorrow.  That he put all on the line for
his nation is so typical of our nation&#39;s ideals.  The disappointment he feels
at the change in direction of our nation after the Korean conflict will be
yours as well." />
