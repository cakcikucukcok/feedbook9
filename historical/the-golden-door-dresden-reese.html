  <title>The Golden Door - Dresden Reese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author graduated with Honors from Loyola
University of Chicago. She now resides in northern
California, enjoys two lovely daughters and a multifaceted
career as an artist/designer, educator and
mentor. I write to entertain and educate (mainly
myself after a tragic accident). Words entertain me and
conjure up pictures without ever uttering sound.
The accident gave me time to write on an old computer donated by the
editor of a local newspaper, and that is another story . . . . . . . . .
In 2006, the world silently celebrated the 50th anniversary of a rebellion
gone awry. It wasnt just kids games fought with sticks and stones against
Soviet tanks, it was bigger than that, it was Hungarys passion for life,
joy and vivre that erupted on that day, the 23rd of October, 1956.
The media barely gave the event fi ve minutes notice. James Michener
captured the saga in his book, Bridge at Andau. Without Micheners
documentation and independent research, I would probably have dismissed
this story as fi ction. At the end, the matron who shared her plight
and joy with me brought out a leather bound photo album fi lled with
post cards Olgi mailed from the free world to her mother behind the Iron
Curtain. Those dates, the pictures and words authenticate whats written.
The story documents the Cold War era, as well as contrasts Soviet
Communism with Americas democratic ideals. As one of my critics,
one of my students, puts it, the story teaches us to be thankful.
The Golden Door is truly a love story,
the love of a man and a woman and their passion for freedom.
Thank you in advance for choosing this book . . . . . . . . . .." />
