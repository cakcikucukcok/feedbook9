  <title>My Mother&#39;s Voice - Kay Mouradian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Researching through volumes in several libraries and archives in the United States, author Kay Mouradian visited the village in Turkey where her mother and her mothers family, along with twenty-five thousand other Armenians, were forced to leave their homes. Traveling over the same deportation route to the deserts of Syria where more than a million Armenians perished, the author became acutely aware of the suffering of her mothers generation and the lingering sense of injustice they carried. 
Like the 6 million Jewish people lost in the Holocaust, Armenians lost an incredibly vibrant, successful, and valuable gene pool of more than a million as a result of the Armenian genocide. This story of fourteen-year-old Flora Munushian, the authors mother, brings an epic chapter in Armenian history to life and takes it to heart. Floras incredible story honors her people with dignity and personifies the human spirit of hope, love, and justice. 
Floras voice is that of all the victims and survivors of the Armenian Genocide, a story that must not be forgotten.  
I am my mothers voice, says Dr. Mouradian, and this is her story." />
