  <title>Fallon&#39;s Wake - Randy Lee Eickhoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Randy Lee Eickhoff is one of today&#39;s most treasured Irish-American scholar/authors. His translations of the Irish national epics The Raid and The Feast have won him praise as a poet and historian while his books on famous figures from America&#39;s past--Bowie and The Fourth Horseman show his talents as a storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Fallon is an ex-IRA assassin who is drawn back into the movement in an attempt to stop drugs from being shipped into Ireland. But what starts as a simple attempt to make peace with the past quickly opens the door to a dangerous future as Fallon becomes enmeshed in a dark game of international crime, a shocking intrigue that involves political echelons at the highest levels. In the process, he also stumbles upon the bitter truth, buried below decades of war--a truth that leaves a country torn at the seams with one last hope for peace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
