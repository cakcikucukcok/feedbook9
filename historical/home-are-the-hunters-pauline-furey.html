&lt;H4&gt;About the Book&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The celebration of allied victory following the end of World War II has transitioned into the mammoth task of restoration. Three people among the millions in Great Britain look to the future with diverse levels of aspiration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
David Parke, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot who was badly burned during the Battle of Britain, faces the dilemma of leading a productive life with disabled hands. His French grandparents who own a vineyard in Aix en Provence are traumatized by the past German occupation of their country and suggest that David learn the intricacies of the wine industry with a view to ultimately assuming ownership of the chateau. To enhance future international business possibilities he visits the vineyards of northern California where he discovers another unsettling reason for being there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His French mother, Janine, who functioned as an agent for British Intelligence in occupied France, acknowledges the dire need to help the thousands of refugees still displaced from their homelands.  Her major focus is on the lost children
of the war and her investigations coincidentally merge with her sons activities both in France and America.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A child at the wars onset, Kate Hawkins is now moving into womanhood and is making good use of her extraordinary artistic talent by depicting the plight of children who have been separated from their parents during wartime conditions. Her unique ability to highlight an expression of anguish or joy
with a mere pencil stroke comes to the attention of the United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and she is employed as a representative artist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, the War Crimes Tribunal is in session at Nuremburg and evasive war criminals are being sought to bring to justice. A cabal of dedicated Nazi hunters is working to track down and apprehend these fugitives and these activities are the undercurrent of the story. Surprisingly, the three diverse occupations of David, Janine, and Kate are affected by these grim activities and they unexpectedly become involved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
HOME ARE THE HUNTERS is a sequel to the wartime novel by the same author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trafford.com/02-1021&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE LONG MAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and brings to a conclusion the story of the three appealing characters the reader has come to know and perhaps befriend.
