  <title>The Fifth Avenue Artists Society - Joy Callaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Bronx, 1891. Virginia Loftin, the boldest of four artistic sisters in a family living in genteel poverty, knows what she wants most: to become a celebrated novelist despite her gender, and to marry Charlie, the boy next door and her first love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Charlie proposes instead to a woman from a wealthy family, Ginny is devastated; shutting out her family, she holes up and turns their story into fiction, obsessively rewriting a better ending. Though she works with newfound intensity, literary success eludes her&amp;#8212;until she attends a salon hosted in her brother&amp;#8217;s writer friend John Hopper&amp;#8217;s Fifth Avenue mansion. Among painters, musicians, actors, and writers, Ginny returns to herself, even blooming under the handsome, enigmatic John&amp;#8217;s increasingly romantic attentions. &lt;/p&gt;Just as she and her siblings have become swept up in the society, though, Charlie throws himself back into her path, and Ginny learns that the salon&amp;#8217;s bright lights may be obscuring some dark shadows. Torn between two worlds that aren&amp;#8217;t quite as she&amp;#8217;d imagined them, Ginny will realize how high the stakes are for her family, her writing, and her chance at love." />
