  <title>The Missing Piece of the Puzzle - Bruce Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In The Missing Piece of the Puzzle, two men are running out of time to have their dreams come true. Max Duncan hopes to become an accomplished author but he cannot find a good story to write. Sala Walker has a sea trunk filled with historical materials that have never been made public, but he cannot write. Neither man can achieve success on his own until a curious letter brings them together. Each man will learn that he holds the key to ther other&#39;s success.
The Missing Piece of the Puzzle is a story of international intrigue, a terrifying skyjacking incident, travel to a forbidden place, a hurricane with disasterous effects, a debilitating disease that affects one of the men, and even a frightening and unexpected encounter with one of the men&#39;s wives.
This is a fast paced compelling novel that brings a questionable incident in American history, the explosion and the sinking of the battleship, The Maine in 1898, into the twenty-first century." />
