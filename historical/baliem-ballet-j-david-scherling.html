  <title>Baliem Ballet - J. David Scherling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in the jungles of Papua, Indonesia, Deena Fuchida questioned everything. Baliem Ballet is the story of how God provided answers for her most amazing questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Dave Scherling, former Oak Hills Christian College student, board member, and staff administrator, creatively weaves together the story of Deena, fictional heroine of Baliem Ballet, with source documents and scriptural interpretation to form an intriguing story that sheds light on Gods sovereignty in the ups and downs of life.&lt;br /&gt;
Steven Ware, PhD, dean of education, Oak Hills Christian College, Bemidji, Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one who has spent his life researching for evidence that supports the veracity of the Sacred Scriptures, I have pondered the possibility of documentary finds that could shed light on aspects of Scripture that we often wonder about. The Baliem Ballet heroine, Deena, finds a document, though fictitious, which portrays the exciting reasons why we continue.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Cornuke, PhD, president of the Bible Archaeology Search and Exploration (BASE) Institute, author, and speaker, Monument, Colorado&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baliem Ballet reminds me of our ministry among the Sawi people of southern Papua. The story is fiction, but not farfetched. It describes how one girl, Deena, exemplifies the call God is placing on the native people there. The church today is sending missionaries, not only to other areas of the island, but around the worldtrained missionaries who do admirable work.&lt;br /&gt;
