  <title>The Big People - K. H. Linville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1897 in Seattle, Washington, as Elmer trudges through the streets in search of food and work. Across town, Elmers uncle Henry goes about his day scooping horse droppings, a job he is grateful to have. But everything is about to change when Elmer gets wind that ordinary men are striking it rich by panning for gold in the Klondike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the rumors that traveling to the Yukon can be treacherous, the two men are determined to escape their wretched existence and experience the heyday of the gold rush. After their heroism in saving a stranger from a bloody assault results in two free steamship tickets, Henry and Elmer race to Skagway, Alaska. As they experience the incredible events, strange spectacles, and amazing characters of the time, Henry and Elmer also suffer unexpected perils and hardships. But it is not until the two men acquire a seemingly insignificant object during a street brawl that they are quickly driven toward big trouble and to solve a complex mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Big People&lt;/i&gt; is the exciting tale of two men during the late 1800s as they journey toward the Yukon and the glittering city of gold with the hope of realizing all their financial dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
