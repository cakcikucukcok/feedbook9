  <title>Lizzie&#39;s Tale - Wilson S Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Old Balmain House Series continues&lt;br /&gt;
In 1963 a new family lives in the old house in Balmain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Fifteen year old Lizzie, her mother and six year old brother&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A rich friend invites Lizzie to a party &amp;ndash; the future glitters bright.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
She is plied with champagne - she has never had a drink before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Three men, she thinks are her friends, ask her to come for a drive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
They take her to a park and rape her. Mortified, she hides it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She finds she is pregnant. She knows officials will take her baby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Rape was bad enough, losing her child is unthinkable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
She runs away, she will not let this most awful thing happen&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Melbourne she seeks to build a new life, just her with a tiny baby.&lt;br /&gt;
Life is unbelievably hard, no money, no food, no one to help her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In desperation she becomes a prostitute, her least bad option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
But authorities discover her age and seek to take her child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She flees again to Broome, builds a new respectable life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
But her story is discovered - now she is pursued again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
With nowhere else to go she drives far into the desert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stranded with no water and a six year old daughter, help comes from an unexpected quarter. A silver locket of an unknown child is the key to her survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
