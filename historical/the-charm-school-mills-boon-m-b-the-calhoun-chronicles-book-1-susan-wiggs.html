  <title>The Charm School (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (The Calhoun Chronicles, Book 1) - Susan Wiggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The captain had abandoned society. She was too unrefined for it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An awkward misfit in an accomplished Boston family, Isadora Peabody yearns to escape her social isolation and sneaks aboard the Silver Swan, bound for Rio, leaving it all behind. Ryan Calhoun, too, had a good family name. But he&#39;d purposely walked away from everything it afforded him. Driven by his quest to right an old wrong, the fiery, temperamental sea captain barely registers the meek young woman who comes aboard his ship. To the Swan&#39;s motley crew, the tides of attraction clearly flow between the two. Teaching her the charms of a lady, they hope to build the confidence she needs to attract not only their lonely captain&#39;s attention, but his heart, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For everyone knows the greatest charms are not those of the formal lady, but rather the possibilities of a new world built on love.&lt;/p&gt;
