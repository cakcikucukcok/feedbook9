  <title>The Amu - Royston Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE AMU 
The Amuthis Asiatic race which invaded and conquered ancient Egypt during a time of cosmic upheaval, then enslaved most of Egypt for over four hundred years. 
It seems probable that in 1491 BC, a large asteroid hit the earth but did not reach the ground but bounced off our atmosphere. Beneath it, it would have created an explosion as great as one hundred Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding simultaneously. It was this that created the volcanic eruptions and tsunamis which did so much damage. 
It was at this time when Egypt was beset with such terrible cosmic damage that Moses and the Hebrews made their exit and the time when the Amu entered an Egypt paralysed and at their mercy. 
It has been assumed for a long time that this Amu invasion occurred around 2000 BC. Yet the Bible seems to indicate that Moses and the Israelites fled Egypt around 1500 BC. 
Thus we must deduct some five hundred years from events stated as happening so much earlier. There are of course many more reasons for assuming this fact. 
Then some four hundred years later, a rebellion by Upper Egypt, and later, Pharaoh Ahmose and Thutmose I freed Egypt from the Amu and went on to crown Princess Makere Hatshepsut as the only female pharaoh.
