  <title>Evie and Jack - Glenn Haybittle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;During the Battle of Britain Evie Devereux is an RT operator in the control tower of a Fighter Command airfield. Here she commences an affair with a Spitfire pilot, Jack Cave. Jack, ashamed of his father who was shot as a coward in France during world war 1 and of his working class background, has invented a new identity for himself as Guy Wentworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1943 Evie joins the SOE. Like Jack, she too now has a false identity. Reports that the Gestapo have infiltrated entire SOE circuits in France have been ignored by London HQ. On the night of her departure she finds a note in her pocket warning her not to trust the man she is travelling with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evie &amp;amp; Jack is a riveting novel of suspense, deception and love which brings vividly to life the experiences of a Spitfire pilot and an undercover secret agent working in the Gestapo-infested atmosphere of occupied France.&lt;/p&gt;" />
