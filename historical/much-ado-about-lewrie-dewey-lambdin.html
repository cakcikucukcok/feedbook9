  <title>Much Ado About Lewrie - Dewey Lambdin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;  The twenty-fifth novel in Dewey Lambdin&#39;s beloved series of historical naval adventure &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lewrie loses his ship and his command when he receives news that Vigilance must return to England to be decommissioned and turned over to the dockyards for a complete refit. Lewrie is grounded, put on half-pay, and his crew disperses to look for new positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s late Autumn, and being ashore is heavenly, after a time. Lewrie spends time with his wife Jessica, helps his son Hugh find a new ship, and happily marries off Charlotte. Life onshore is quiet until Lewrie finds himself once again in the headlines of the city papers after discovering a dognapping gang and uncovering stolen Bisquits and Rembrants. The headlines should be positive, but soon the tides turn against Lewrie once again. There&#39;s never a dull moment for Lewrie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dewey Lambdin is the reigning master of maritime fiction, celebrated as the heir to Patrick O&#39;Brian and C.S. Forester. For over twenty years, his devoted fans have followed the adventures of Alan Lewrie, Royal Navy, from his days as a midshipmen to captain of his own ship and, though on somewhat dubious grounds, a baronetcy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
