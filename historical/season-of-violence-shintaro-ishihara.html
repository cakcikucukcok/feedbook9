  <title>Season of Violence - Shintaro Ishihara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Violent, sensual, and seemingly un-Japanese, the stories in &lt;I&gt;Season of Violence&lt;/I&gt; nevertheless depict Japanese teenagers of the present in compulsive but often unconscious revolt against the moral codes of &quot;old Japan.&quot; Yet these stories tell of youth who offer no real, modern morality to replace the old&amp;#151;only the anti-morality of indiscriminate sex, brutality, and living for today&#39;s pleasures and sensations. These are stories of teenagers who came to be known as &lt;I&gt;Taiyozoku&amp;#151;&lt;/I&gt; the Sun Tribe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Season of Violence&lt;/I&gt; won for its young author, Shintaro Ishihara, Japan&#39;s coveted Akutagawa Prize. Thus, &lt;I&gt;Season of Violence&lt;/I&gt; is a good deal more than fast-moving, forcefully written fiction; it is vital social commentary on contemporary Japan which gives unexpected dimension to the traditional cardboard image of the Japanese student as somber, diligent, and obedient.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ishihara&#39;s stories of Japanese who were born in the ashes of war and defeat and raised in the fast-moving world of the postwar boom are stark accounts of a period when the values of the past have been discarded for misguided materialism and pleasure-seeking.&lt;/div&gt;" />
