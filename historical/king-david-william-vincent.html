  <title>King David - William Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This dramatic dialogue tells the story of Israels and the Bibles illustrious King David, but only in the eyes of this reader/author, who sees or senses more than the legendary figurethe very tragic, as to say, and very troubled icon of both religious history and literary lore.
King David, as great a leader and conqueror of the Palestine as he was, as well as the establisher/founder of Isrealor, we should say, of all Judeawas, in truth, an otherwise normal man of his time who succumbed to many human faults that took him to the hell, of which his/their religion ever dreaded.
From his pride in killing the giant of Elah to his spidery murder of one of his brave (though foreign) captains in order to acquire his wife, as well as the neglect of his sons and his self-preoccupation with power, we the readers see the man David for the first time. It is told in a storyline never told before, one not Hollywood-ized, starring a Charlton or a Brad, and ending with a moving to Montana soon sunset and its flossing hero on a camel riding off to a musically triumphant Mancini composition.
Yet this king, so-called, who wrote so many beautiful prayersthe book of Psalmsand who, regardless of all his familiar woes, did, in fact, establish the great Israel of biblical days and succeed in overcoming and controlling his barbaric (more heathen/pagan religious) neighbors also overcame great and crushing inner turmoil and/or spiritual troubles to even be as great a general in those battles as he was in those other battles for control on the fields of bloodshed. His confessions in his intimate talks with God reveal King David thus, as you, the reader (I think), will feel in the agony of his spirit throughout. For the man of his times (barbaric times, for certain) that he surely was, he did struggle heroically, both politically and spiritually, to overcome the heathen political enemies and the satanic/demonic spiritual enemies that did play upon his (truly) absolute power then and there. This script tries to capture the liver, the spleen, and the heart of the man, i.e., in the way of that purging emotional catharsis rather than creating just another filmy hero of history." />
