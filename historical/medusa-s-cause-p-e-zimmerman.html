  <title>Medusa’S Cause - P. E. Zimmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Love is immeasurable
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    On an isolated cape high above a churning sea, a mysterious young woman of enchanting beauty enters a lonely temple. Lulled there by inconceivable desire,
    it is a clandestine meeting that will forever alter her fate. Wishing only to capture the love of a god, she instead commits a grievous act of sin against
    an angry goddess and sets in motion a chain of events that not only tears her world apart, but those that love her as well...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In a world ruled by men, and explained by myth, two brave sisters must break the rules and embark on a perilous journey. Divided by difference, yet united
    by a singular cause, they must go out into a world that is at once cruel and capricious; a world which often views and treats women as being no better than
    slaves
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It is a journey that will take them across the width and breadth of ancient Greece. From the highest of mountains, to the deepest of valleys; to the most
    fabled of lands where myths come to life and futures are told, and finally, to the dark confines of the Underworld itself in search of answers. It is a
    journey that will see them pitted against unforeseen challenges and dangers, and at times against each other. But as their journey of struggle and
    discovery unfolds, something unusual begins to take shape, and the question of what happened to their sister is invariably replaced with one of a much
    deeper meaning
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    How far would you go to save the soul of someone you love?
