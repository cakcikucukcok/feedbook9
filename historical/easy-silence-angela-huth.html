  <title>Easy Silence - Angela Huth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Handles have one of those quiet, suburban marriages that has ticked along for decades without anything very momentous happening. William, a distinguished violinist and leader of the Elmtree Quartet, and Grace, a modest watercolorist, enjoy a serence, domestic routine where easy silence, an acceptance of each other&#39;s ways, is the norm. The two spend each day in their respective corners of the house--William upstairs practicing, and Grace downstairs working on her latest wildflower illustration--and they even take careful steps to prevent a chance encounter. For what do people who&#39;ve been married that long say when they meet on the stairs? But just as quickly as their routine emerges, it is yanked away by the winds of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the long-serving viola player resigns from William&#39;s quartet, the Elmtree hires Bonnie, a brilliant young player with perfect dimples and an ample bosom. In no time, William is smitten. Meanwhile, Grace&#39;s days have become enlivened by visits from Lucien, a troubled young man who lives down the street with the mothers he loathes. Though his presence unnerves Grace, he provides her days with a bittersweet frisson, and before long, she is captivated. As William and Grace secretly find their hearts tugged in opposite directions, the once-cozy couple moves closer to confrontation. But with the introduction of sudden menace, the story takes a darker turn--until real-life horror explodes and a murderous twist sends their world spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Land Girls &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Wives of the Fishermen&lt;/i&gt; comes an elegant, if shocking, dissection of a middle-class marriage. In &lt;i&gt;Easy Silence&lt;/i&gt;, Huth combines remarkable insight with biting wit to create a delicious black comedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
