  <title>One Who Knows Horses - Max Windham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 1830, Zachery Morris leaves the hot humidity of Mississippi with his big stallion Ollie. Having known the horse since its birth, Ollie is Zacherys best friend. Over the course of his travels, men often offer to pay to breed Ollie, fawning over his bloodline, but Zachery always refuses. Ollie is something unique. Truly, its almost as if he can detect evil in men.
While traveling through St. Louis, Zachery picks up four travel companions: Mathew, Pete, and the twins. They travel deep into the majesty of the Rocky Mountains, trusting safety in numbers. Mathew soon takes charge as their leader. Pete, the old trapper, just waits around to take orders. The twins dont even have names, but they do their share.
Journeying through such beautiful wilderness has its dangers, as Zachery soon discovers. In some areas, he is the only white man whos ever been there, which comes as a shock to the natives. As he seeks his fortune, lessons are learned and blood spilled in the dangerous plains of the Wild Westbut Zachery and Ollie ride on, following their shared destiny of greatness." />
