  <title>Miss Ladybug Learns a Lesson - Tracy L. Shires, Kodi Galvan, Mary Woodard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miss Ladybug lives in a big, beautiful valley. Many adventures await her outside the doors of her little home. Shes always dreamed of flying away to see the countryside and all of its beauty. 
One day, when all of her baby bugs are sound asleep for their afternoon nap, Miss Ladybug decides its the perfect time to leave her home and explore her environment. She embarks on adventures several days in a row where she meets Robbie Raccoon, Randy Rabbit, and Bobby Beaver. All of the characters try to tell her to return to her babies because her house is on fire.
In this picture book for children, Miss Ladybug learns a very important lesson: the world around her is quite big and leaving her children all alone is never a good idea.
Soon Miss Ladybug came upon Robbie Raccoon working hard on cleaning his fish.
Robbie Raccoon looked up, smiled and began singing... Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children are all alone.
Oh my exclaimed Miss Ladybug, and off she went flying straight for home with great fear in her heart. When she arrived home, she discovered that her baby bugs were still fast asleep. Whew  Miss Ladybug thought, that was scary. Silly raccoon, theres no fire at home, and everything is fine." />
