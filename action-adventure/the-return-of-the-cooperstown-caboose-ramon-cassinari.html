  <title>The Return of the Cooperstown Caboose - Ramon Cassinari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theyre back! Smashing the Dimension boundaries again!
Hot summer vacation explodes with ultimate awesome adventures as Dakota, Matt, Lori, Jess and Cowboy return back to Dimension Zero.
In this next chapter of the fantastic Cooperstown Caboose Trilogy, Dakota makes a return trip.  His scheme:  Embark on a mission to find the secret treasure of the Cardorzins. Hidden in a world of monsters and supernatural oddities are riches of gold, the likes of which the world has never seen or known.
 Enter the evil land of Cycloptica, ruled by a mystic lion, where every living creature has only one eye and is guarded by a giant Cyclops. 
Their trip is cut short when they learn that the entire evil land of Gathk will be destroyed and that they must return back to our dimension. Their friend, the incredible Professor Hinstein, comes to the rescue again.   
The kids go on a quest to obtain more Uranium for the Professor to construct atomic transporters for the return trip.  The most unthinkable happens:  Lost, the kids find themselves in The Pit of Ghosts, the entrance into a hellish spirit world.  Extreme terrifying adventures await the reader when they get a peek inside the most evil place in the universe! 
Do the kids escape unscathed?  Will they be up for the ultimate challenge?  Can Cowboy continue his struggle to crack the Megalith code?  Its the ultimate race now as the kids try and beat the doomsday clock and help save the world from the impending destruction that began back in year 2012!  Do they all return home  or is one of them lost forever?
The ultimate summer vacation continues to heat up as Dimension Zero awaits the Return of the Cooperstown Caboose." />
