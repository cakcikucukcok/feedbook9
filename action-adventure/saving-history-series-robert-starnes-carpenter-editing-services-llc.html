      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young man&amp;rsquo;s adventure begins with him waking up, in Brooklyn, on his seventeenth birthday and having his favorite breakfast with his parents. After they ate breakfast, his parents had a gift for him. The gift was this antique watch he had been eyeing for some time now, from an old bookstore he loves to go to when he wants to escape the world of being a teenager. After receiving the watch from his parents, they told him about another surprise they had for him so he went to his room to get ready for the day, only to return to an empty apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his parents missing, Ian decides to go to the first place he can think of to look for them and that is Belvedere Castle, which is in Central Park. Unbeknown to Ian, going to Belvedere Castle would be start of his adventures, because he never makes it to Central Park. Instead, he returns home only to find out that he is late to his own surprise eighteenth birthday party. Ian is left with no memories of what happened between leaving home to look for his parents and returning right after, so he thought, with a year having passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given a gift from his best friend&amp;nbsp;Kayla that revealed a silver ring with some inscription on the inside of it, which neither of them knew what language it was written in, he decided to fill Kayla in on his missing year and the dreams he just had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Ian is alone again, he knows it&amp;rsquo;s time to get up and get ready for his first day of being eighteen. After his shower he put on the watch his parents gave him for his seventeenth birthday and the ring Kayla just gave him for his eighteenth birthday, which in doing so sends Ian back to being seventeen again. Now he has to relive his seventeenth year again, with no memories of the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Ian is back to seventeen, he finally learns what the second gift was his parents were going to give him with the watch on his first seventeenth birthday and that was to go away to a special school. Now there are a few things that are different with his seventeen this time than the first. One, his parents don&amp;rsquo;t give him the watch, or time keeper, but they are aware of what it is to their bloodline and are shocked he has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a future memory being shown to Ian, while he is asleep, let him know he was shown the memories by someone else. In the end, Ian does come face to face with the person who had shown him the memories, including the forth one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior informs Ian that he himself is from the future, that came back to stop someone from changing something in Ian&amp;rsquo;s timeline that causes Junior&amp;rsquo;s timeline to change, but not a way even Junior could expect. Junior finds out who went back to Ian&amp;rsquo;s time from his own time to change things, but Junior was too late to stop them. Junior realizes it was his mother that went back and erased herself from history. Just as he fades away from his own timeline and right in front of Ian during his final dream visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian wakes up so confused about everything he has learned, but knowing he needed rest, he went back to sleep. That was only until he heard, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget me Ian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes shoot open and his only word is &amp;ldquo;Kayla.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
