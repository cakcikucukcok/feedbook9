  <title>Where an Angel&#39;s On a Rope - Mara Purl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can an intuition save a man&amp;rsquo;s life? Astronomer and competent mountain climber Cornelius Smith depends upon his intelligence for both his career and his hobby. Never before has he faced a situation where logical steps couldn&amp;rsquo;t be followed to an inevitable conclusion. But just two days before Christmas, it&amp;rsquo;s going to take more than logic to get him off the sheer rock face where he can neither climb out, nor slide down. Though his own brand of spiritual awareness has sometimes appeared over his mental horizon, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call himself religious. Yet how can he explain the persistent image of a tiny angel that seems to hover over him on the mountain? And what will he do with the illogical intuition that won&amp;rsquo;t leave him alone? Though the e-book stands alone, it also extends the Milford-Haven Novels, the critically acclaimed, best-selling series, a multi-generational saga. Based on Purl&amp;rsquo;s BBC Radio drama Milford-Haven U.S.A.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
