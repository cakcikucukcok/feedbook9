  <title>Justice for Adam - Mike Holst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Justice for Adam is a compelling and rewarding story for anyone who has been disappointed by the legal system.&lt;p&gt; 
Adam Holton had everything he wanted in life. A budding career and a good life in a small town he loved so much. The real prize for him however was Mandy, his beautiful betrothed friend. Then just like that she was abducted, brutalized and murdered, and Adams world as he knew it, came to a screeching halt. His only consolation was to see the man who did it punished in a court of law.&lt;p&gt; 
It was not to happen, however, and the perpetrator was released on a technicality with the help of his shrewd lawyer. Adam was enraged, and then he snapped and took the law into his own hands. He became the fugitive, instead of the man who had killed his sweetheart and ruined his life.&lt;p&gt; 
Sometimes however justice is served in strange ways in small town America, where bloodlines and feelings can come to the surface and wrongs get made into rights." />
