  <title>Inca Moon Chronicle I - P.H. Carmichael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story begins with murder, and a journey into the secret heart of a vast land where demigods rule millions in one of the most majestic, brutal, and tragic empires of the ancient world. Inca Moon is a tale of courage and intrigue, ruthless ambition, and devotion betrayed. With the heroine Qori Qoyllur, we travel through deserts, mountains, and jungles, face armies and assassins, experience the pomp and rituals of a vanished world. We follow her through tangled loves and loyalties, share emotions and personal tragedies, see her rise to become an Inca healer, and covertly, a special agent to the emperor. On this journey, we meet great lords and ladies, heroes and scoundrels:
Reclusive Lord Atoq is an elegant man who directs the imperial spy web from his country estate. With the old emperor on his deathbed and conspiracy threatening to plunge the empire into civil war, Lord Atoq must send his elite agents into peril. Qori loves him like a father, but what secrets is he holding back?
Lady Sisa is breathtakingly beautiful. Men want her, women envy her. Why is she so feared?
Tanta Karwa is a healer to the nobility and Qoris beloved mother-in-law. She knows the truth but cannot speak it.
He who rules the jungle, Condin Savana, Wizard of the East, sees Qoris destiny. He will arm her, but he will not interfere with fate.
These and other vivid characters inhabit the world of Qori Qoyllur. Based on old Spanish accounts and modern findings, this novel brings the Inca Empire alive with gripping authenticity." />
