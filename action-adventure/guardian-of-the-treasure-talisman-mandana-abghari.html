      <meta name="description" content="Fate has chosen The Guardians for a journey. A journey in search of a treasure that is more precious than gold or diamonds. It is the most priceless of all; peace. Yes, they are in search for peace. The treasure that our father Adam and mother Eve had long lost. This is the plea of the entire humanity that has transcended even from the first cry of a new born child. The desire has lingered for centuries. However, the hunger and thirst of this human desire has been aggravated by the dark forces of evil who hinder them along the way. Pains and deceit will be faced by the Treasure Talisman Guardian who holds the key to attain the treasure. In the last hour of the end of the world, only peace can save the world and nothing else." />
