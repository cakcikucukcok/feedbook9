  <title>The Farenzi Files - Alberto Benet Noguera </title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theres a secret hidden in The Farenzi Files	
A passionate love story. A fast-paced adventure. A spellbinding whodunit. An intriguing medical mystery. And a sweeping multigenerational epic that spans the twentieth century and much of the globe-from Mexico to Italy and beyond. 
The Farenzi Files is all these things and more. At once thrilling, heartbreaking, and inspiring, this is a deeply moving and gripping tale like no other youve ever read. 
We enter the world of The Farenzi Files in the Mexico City of the early 1970s, when Aurelio, a construction engineer, meets the love of his life, a brilliant psychiatry student named Ofelia. 
But the story really starts decades earlier, with the harrowing escape from war-torn Europe by a beautiful young Italian woman named Lucrezia Farenzi. She risks her life to cross Nazi-occupied France and the vast Atlantic Ocean, under constant threat of attack from German subs and bombers, trying to reach an unlikely destination that didnt even exist in the mental geography of most Europeans-the town of Tulancingo in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. 
All the while, Lucrezias father, a good and honorable family doctor in Rome, has made an amazing medical discovery that has the capacity to change the world-for better or for worse, depending on whose hands it falls into. 
This is the long-lost secret that eventually dominates the lives of Aurelio and Ofelia, turning their ideal marriage into a fevered quest for the hidden formula. Through it all, their intense, almost-mystical love gives them strength-until tragedy strikes.
Praise for The Farenzi Files 
A detective story worthy of Agatha Christie. The Farenzi Files teems with intrigue and mystery, as unknown forces stop at nothing, including murder, to get their hands on a medical formula. Written in nimble, staccato-like prose, this is an engrossing novel thats a pleasure to read. I couldnt put it down until the final outcome.
