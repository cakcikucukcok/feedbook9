Rooshth wants to raise her son from the dead, a dark desire that refuels the final battle in a centuries-old war between Zed and Rooshth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fast-paced supernatural thriller fi lled with dark, earthy magic, twelfth century history intertwines with the emerging world of the 1930s as an immortal Anasazi and his son attempt to fulfill their mission before a determined witch acquires the power she has always desired.&lt;/p&gt;" />
