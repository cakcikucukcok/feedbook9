  <title>Terrorist Cove - Lee Heide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Research for &lt;b&gt;Terrorist Cove&lt;/b&gt; was started by Lee Heide about two years 
ago as he foresaw the tragic events of 11 Sep 2001. Not New York&#39;s World Trade Centre
of course, but he was certain that some form of Islamic attack was about to take place
on mainland America. The novel postulates a major Islamic base on northern
Vancouver Island where a Master Bomber (an Iraqi chemical engineer named
Orrin Hadi) has a laboratory and makes bombs to strike at American
installations in Canada. His base is also used for smuggling illegal Asians
into Canada and the U.S. and for shipments of cocaine and heroin bound for
Chinese Triads across the country.
&lt;p&gt;
A small air charter company, located near Vancouver, often flies over
northern Vancouver Island with parties of hunters and fishermen. They discover
the terrorist base and get into trouble doing so, especially the lovely 
aircraft captain - Gina Marcello. Eventually the site is revealed to the RCMP who call 
in a team from JTF-2, Canada&#39;s anti-terrorism force." />
