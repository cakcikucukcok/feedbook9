  <title>The Brink - Mark Fadden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charged with murder and hiding out in the Mexican wilderness, Texas Ranger Danny Cavanaugh contemplates eating a bullet in the exact spot his father did years ago. But when he sees something strange at the nearby converted monastery, the cop inside him takes over. As he investigates, he meets a nearly naked woman running for her life. A judge in the International Court of Justice, Sydney Dumas thought she was there to discuss a secret lawsuit Japan is bringing against the United States.&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., a robbery attempt at the Library of Congress becomes an unimaginable test for newly elected President Jack Butcher. The nearly stolen document is a lost article of the U.S. Constitution, which contains evidence the Founding Fathers foresaw certain collapse for their new country.&lt;p&gt;
As Danny and Sydney race toward Washington, D.C. to reach President Butcher, they are hunted by a relentless killer dispatched by an organization known as The Group; they have infinite resources and will stop at nothing to reach their goal.&lt;p&gt;
Once Danny uncovers the link between the lawsuit, the lost Constitution article, and The Group, he discovers an unthinkable plot designed by a brilliant psychopath whose motive makes them question everything." />
