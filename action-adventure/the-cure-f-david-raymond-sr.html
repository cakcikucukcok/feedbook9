  <title>The Cure - F. David Raymond Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 70s, a small group of men were engaged in a covert operation in Africa. At the end of the operation a decision was made to bring some refugees to the states. Time has passed and one of the little girls has become a very popular prostitute on the streets of LA. She has been murdered and routine blood tests has revealed that not only was she disease free but her blood could contain a cure for AIDS and several other diseases. During the routine process of disposing of the remains, she is cremated and the extra blood is destroyed. A search begins for her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search involves the LAPD, they bring in ICE and they bring in the DOD and the CIA. This is no simple missing person case. The last surviving member of the original mission is required to go to Africa. Our story follows a simple school teacher who has to take a leave of absence to try to find the cure for AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;" />
