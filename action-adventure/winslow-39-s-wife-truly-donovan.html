  <title>Winslow&#39;s Wife - Truly Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A missing husband   a mysterious portrait   a twenty-year-old crime   
&lt;p&gt;The Denver Police think that John Hewitt has simply taken off, probably with another woman, but Caroline Hewitt doesn&#39;t believe it. In frustration, she turns for help to her old friend, middle-aged software consultant Lexy Connor.
Lexy thinks that 35 years without so much as a Christmas card strains the definition of friendship, but she finds it hard to refuse to help. As Lexy explores the world of John Hewitt, she comes to agree that his disappearance is not simply a manifestation of an overdue mid-life crisis; something vastly more sinister has happened.
The only clue is a portrait of an unknown woman, painted by an equally mysterious artist, but it proves to be enough as Lexy discovers once again that there is no limit to the evil people are capable of inflicting on others in the name of love.
Lexy&#39;s search takes her from the lush landscapes of the Mid-Hudson Valley of New York to the stark mountain ridges of Nevada before it ends in a confrontation with a killer in the Rocky Mountains of her own backyard." />
