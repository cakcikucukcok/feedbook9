  <title>Scarlet Minor and the Twin Pikes of Nebo - K.E. Andam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The boy Scarlet Rosendale and his parents, Alice and Thomas Rosendale, had narrowly escaped their home at The Nook, an inn nestled in the harbor to welcome seafarers with a clean bed and hearty food. Without the help of four close friends, Scarlet would by now be imprisoned on the Renegade as a slave to be tortured and killed to break the Curse of Bodiaka. Watching the gulls swoop low over the water in search of fish, Scarlet wondered if his friends Jeffey, Frankin, and Domiq were safe. And had his lifelong harbor pal Skimpy been able to escape the revenge of Ambioca for helping Scarlet and his family get away? Scarlet hoped his friends had not come to harm from the deadly pirate crew of the Renegade, the ship that had formerly belonged to his great grandfather and was rightfully his to claim one day.
Thus continues The Scarlet Minor Chronicles, a story of adventure, true love, greed, and corruption spanning five volumes:
Scarlet Minor and the Renegade
Scarlet Minor and the Twin Pikes of Nebo
Scarlet Minor and the Crossed Blades Skull
Scarlet Minor and the Last Atlantic Fleet
Scarlet Minor and the Isles of Black Gold" />
