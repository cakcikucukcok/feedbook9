  <title>THE ISLAND of APPLEDORE - A young person&#39;s nautical adventure - Adair Aldon, Illustrated by W. B. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone who knows the coast of New England will know also the Island of Appledore and just where it lies. People who know the Isle of Appledore will also tell you that it is not exactly the place described in this book, that it is small and bare with a handful of buildings and rocky with no woods, no meadows, no church, or mill, nor a mill-creek road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps all that the story tells of it that is true is that the rocks of Appledore give forth their strange deep song, &amp;ldquo;the calling of Appledore,&amp;rdquo; as warning of a storm, that there the poppies bloom as nowhere else in the world, that there the surf comes rolling in, day in and day out, the whole year through, and that there one&amp;rsquo;s memory turns back with longing, no matter how many years of absence have gone by.&lt;br /&gt;
There, also, you can sit for hours to watch the huge, green breakers come foaming and tumbling in endless procession up the stony beach; you can watch the nimble sandpipers and the tireless, wheeling gulls; and if you choose you can spin for yourself just such a story, such as this one of Billy Wentworth and Captain Saulsby and Sally Shute, a tale of mysteries and perils and midnight adventures on the shores of Appledore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
YESTERDAY&amp;rsquo;S BOOKS for TODAY&amp;rsquo;S CHARITIES&lt;br /&gt;
