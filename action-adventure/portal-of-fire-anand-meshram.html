  <title>Portal of Fire - Anand Meshram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack Lucas, a twenty-nine-year-old American software engineer, is a short-tempered, highly intricate, and unpredictable guy. He leads a perfunctory life and avoids emotional contact  with everyone around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
    But deep down inside, Jack keeps a burning secret that struggles to get out. No one knows the reason for his irrational anger and Jack is not one to talk about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  His routinely unexciting life begins to change when he is visited by his grandmotherwho died a year ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She comes bearing news for him; they all are going to die is the first of them. She reveals the existence of the afterworld which runs with special sets of rules and curious cases of life-forms, defying all the believed concepts of the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After learning about the dark future that awaits his family, Jack reluctantly follows his Granny through a secret medium, the Portal of Fire, and gets transported into the afterworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Together with an old and cynical 17th-century British named Christopher, a loud-mouthed Hungarian lady called Mirriam, and Granny, Jack travels through the bizarre world, encountering ghoulish creatures and overwhelming forces, in an attempt to break the code of death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
        Can Jack succeed in his mission and bring change to the system of mortality? Find out in the breathtaking pages of &lt;strong&gt;Portal of Fire&lt;/strong&gt;.
