  <title>Buddie Fox - Bev Magee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joshua was leery when an old classmate invited him home for a party.  His suspicions were confirmed when Allen Pinkerton paid him a visit.  Shawna was used to setting up traps and knew this was one if there ever was one.  The real question was, who wanted Joshua bad enough to risk Shawnas wrath.
     Camille Harper-Carter was obsessed with Indians.  There was nothing she wouldnt do to get one in particular, Joshua Kane.  She thought  money was the answer.  But when he married into the rich Fox family, she knew it was something else.  Knowing her kind, she knew a scandal would get results.  Her downfall, underestimating Shawna Fox-Kane.
     Ready for anything, Shawna wasnt surprised when Camille showed up at her door with a child in tow.  A woman low enough to use her own child for blackmail didnt deserve to keep that child.  What Shawna wondered about was, who was the boys real father.
     Coyote lived a life on the run from the day he left his fathers tribe.  He never gave the white woman he rescued from a raid much thought when she returned to her people, until Little Eagle came looking for him.  The woman had a child that she was passing off as anothers.  And it was up to him to find the truth.
     The numerous attempts on his life made Joshua wary when one of the Harpers caught up with him.  But Anson wasnt looking for him.  He was hiding his girl out in a small town.  A town where an old friend of Shawnas had tangled with some of the Harper clan.  Now, they had to help the friend and the girl while saving the boy from his mothers antics.  Well, thats what Joshua got when he married a Fox." />
