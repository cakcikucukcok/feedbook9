  <title>Dancer - Otis Morphew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seth Joe-Bob Dancer, gunfighter, road agent, and killer was now a rancher, devoted husband, and father of two sons, one nineteen, the other now seventeen; and they were his life! 
Having left who he once was far behind him, his new role in life was one of happiness and most times uneventful, that is until his eldest son was murdered in Dallas, Texas, and his youngest blamed for the crime! 
Dancer had changed his name before the Civil War on the day he married Laura and, together, raised two strapping sons. He had not worn his gun since wars end, had in fact not thought of his violent past, until now! He had not fired the sidearm in almost eighteen years, but now, his son was dead! 
He didnt know what to expect when he went to Dallas; he only knew he had to see about it! He did, however, know that his youngest son was innocent, and the only way to save him was to find the real killer. But how? Dallas was a town almost completely under the thumb of organized crime, and the law was either helpless to combat it or was on the syndicates payroll or had been blackmailed into submission. After reconstruction, the federal governments policy was not to interfere with local politics unless asked or shown proof of reasons why they should, but the people of Dallas were too afraid to ask for that help, and the syndicate bosses had possession of the proof! 
Seth Mabry remembered only one thing from his mothers Bible teachings, and that one thing became his religion. He believed in an eye for an eye, and if he was wronged, he would collect!" />
