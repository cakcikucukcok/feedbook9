  <title>Padrow G. and the Moonlight Sonata - Paul Ehrlich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about Padrow Guggenheim, a talented young man whose personal problems need to be resolved. In the beginning he is plagued by hallucinations. As he gets rid of these, his leadership qualities start to take over, and he becomes the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. He also becomes an authority on dirty fighting and exposes a leading Russian fighter, known as Tricky Serg, whom he gets sent to jail. Padrow is finally offered a position he cannot refuse, to become a kind of Sir Lancelot to help dirty young street fighters learn to live a life of chivalry and even elegance. Most of this learning takes place in a gorgeous new university made entirely of sculptured and colored glass. Many young girls are madly in love with Padrow, but he is waiting for the real Princess Guinevere to appear and possibly capture his heart." />
