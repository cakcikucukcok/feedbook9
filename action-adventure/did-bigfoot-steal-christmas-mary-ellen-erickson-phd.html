Soon they discover that intrigue and excitement await them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ski lodge has plenty of chores to keep the children busy, like chopping wood and caring for a bunch of Siberian husky race dogs. Even so, theres still time for fun. Thirteen-year-old Audrey has to make the tough decisions to keep her rambunctious twelve-year-old cousin Jenny and shy friend Missy in line. DennyJennys twinand his buddy Randy continue to take risks that bring them face-to-face with a big black wolf. Eight-year-old Ty is a source of delight as he and Laddie, the family dog, have one adventure after another, including a run-in with an angry bull moose.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But the fun comes to a halt when the kids find out that someone is vandalizing the Husky Hideaway and trying to prevent Basil from winning the Northern Lights Sled Dog Race. Who could it be? Is the culprit Bigfoot? With good teamwork, true friendship, and some help from the adults, the Peanut Butter Club members search for clues to solve the mystery!&lt;/p&gt;" />
