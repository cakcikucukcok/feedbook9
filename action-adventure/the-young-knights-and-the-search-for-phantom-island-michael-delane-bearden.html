  <title>The Young Knights and the Search for Phantom Island - Michael Delane Bearden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Timothy Knight appears to be a normal thirteen-year-old boy who enjoys learning the powers of deduction from Dr. Crowne, a British professor of languages; crossing blades with Monsieur Deveaux, a French master of the sword; and hanging out with his friends Anthony, Sammy, Tony, and Baby Joe. Since his brother Michael left home on a sailing vessel, he has a love for ships. His grandfather introduces him to an old friend, Captain Horatio P. Spears.
Captain Spears takes Timothy aboard his ship and tells him a story about his rescue at sea by the Seeps Holmen, a Norwegian whaling ship. The captain learns the Seeps Holmen is carrying a secret cargo and is being pursued by an enemy submarine. Captain Spears plots a course to escape the U-boat and whisks the treasure safely up the channel to the Port of Houston. But during a storm, the treasure mysteriously disappears.
Timothy Knight shares the captains tale with his friends, and they devise a plan to find the missing treasure. Little do the boys know that an evil mastermind, the Black Scarab, is obsessed with the treasurethe Mask of Nephthys. His brotherhood of assassins has been sent to steal the mystical relic. The Black Scarab plans to use its power to create an army of immortals and become pharaoh of the world.
Now the young knights search for Phantom Island to find the Mask of Nephthys before the earth is plunged into an apocalypse." />
