  <title>Luz Stella&#39;s Tale - Max Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luz Stella wanted the world to be a better place. When she found it to be otherwise, she did not hesitate to do all in her power to change it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bismark Pacheco was there to do his part-to save the world, and to save Luz Stella. Or was it the other way around?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When Pacheco loses his passport in a desperate deep water escape from a Cape Canaveral Cruise ship, the two seek help in Birmingham from their old friend Wilson Abut. The former quarterback, now a journalist, stirs the pot with his column &lt;i&gt;Abut To You&lt;/i&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bubba Driver, the mammoth defensive tackle, runs interference. Eighty-year-old Dr. Helene Stern dodges terrorists who would destroy her Health First Clinic, and provides comfort to Siboney, the Latin beauty and unapologetic revolutionary. All are arrayed against the steely-eyed Bobby Sanchez who wants to bring down anything and anyone who would stand for an orderly world. This is &lt;i&gt;Luz Stella&#39;s Tale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;" />
