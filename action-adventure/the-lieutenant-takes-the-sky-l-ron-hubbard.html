  <title>The Lieutenant Takes the Sky - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;American pilot Mike Malloy has been unjustly sentenced to five years in a  Moroccan penal battalion&amp;mdash;which is French for death sentence. But  Malloy, who could easily pass for Douglas Fairbanks, is about to get a  reprieve . . . if he&amp;rsquo;s willing to fly into the heart of the Sahara and  into the teeth of a Berber rebellion. The expedition could have  unexpected benefits. One of his passengers is a young woman whose eyes  are as beautiful and blue as the wild blue yonder. . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hubbard once said that writers too often  &amp;ldquo;forget a great deal of the languorous quality which made the Arabian  Nights so pleasing. Jewels, beautiful women, towering cities filled with  mysterious shadows, sultans equally handy with robes of honor and the  beheading sword . . . these things still exist, undimmed, losing no  luster to the permeating Occidental flavor which reaches even the far  corners of the earth today.&amp;rdquo; Hubbard brings this unique insight to his  stories of North Africa and the Legionnaires, investing them with an  authenticity of time, place and character that kept his readers asking  for more.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
