  <title>House of Bohannon - Robert Dean Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Teagan is the seed of the Tyrant Emperor Bohannon. She lives on the planet Beasly. Teagan is a servant, slave, and a dangerous secret. She is eighteen and it&#39;s time for her to take the throne from her father. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Haven has been purged of all life because she might exist and because the emperor had a dream. He dreamed of the two moons of Haven over the shoulder of a woman he does not know. In the dream the woman takes his throne and his life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teagan has the black rose of Bohannon tattooed on her shoulder blade and the population of Beasly knows exactly what they have in their midst. It&#39;s for her to find support and win the throne. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teagan looks to the crowd. The emperor rules the land but I rule your heart. Which is stronger, the soil or the plow? I say to you the plow turns the soil and the heart rules the plow. Be patient my love, the Queen of Light will rule. &lt;/P&gt;
