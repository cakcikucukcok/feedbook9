  <title>Behind the Tall Walls: from Palace to Prison - Azar Aryanpour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Third Man Out is a suspense mystery filled with action. The plot revolves around Destiny Morgan and Nolan Chapman who meet and fall in love not knowing that they had met 15 years earlier. That night, Nolan&#39;&#39;s wife was killed at the hand of one of the now world&#39;&#39;s largest drug lords  Santiago. Destiny, only 12 then, was held hostage by him the same night. Destiny was placed in the Witness Protection Program because she is the only person in America that can identify Santiago who now lives in Peru.
Nolan is a professional baseball player who has worked undercover to assist the DEA in capturing 2 of the 3 drug pushers from that night. To get Santiago to America, a fake marriage was staged between Sonya, a superstar model and Nolan. Sonya befriends Santiago&#39;&#39;s wife Monet, who is a clothes fanatic. Thru Drug Enforcement Agency undercover agents Santigo is gotten word of an alleged affair between Monet and Nolan.
This infuriates Santiago enough to try to sneak into America. But Destiny, the DEA, and Nolan are waiting at the Port of New Orleans for him. A gun battle occurs and Santiago is shot. He falls off the ship into the Mississippi River. And the third man is out, it seems!" />
