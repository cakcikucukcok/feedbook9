  <title>Where the Galaxy Collides - Shirley Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When seamstress Olivia Dirkspin leaves Central City for a three-week holiday, shes looking for a quiet, secluded place to get away from it all. She finds the Due North of Zenith Lodge, a place with no radio and no phone, just the solution. In addition, the advertisement boasts that this location in the wilderness forests of northern Saskatchewan hosts spectacular views of the Northern Lights. But rest and relaxation arent exactly what she receives.&lt;p&gt; 
Olivia hopes that getting away from the fast pace of the city will help her to re-evaluate her life. Her fifteen-year-old adopted daughter, Lisa, has moved out, leaving Olivia to put her life back together. On her journey to the lodge, she meets the owner, Vincent Randall; she soon discovers they have much in common. And with a host of relatives, friends, and strangers, they become embroiled in an escapade that speaks of both love and heartache.&lt;p&gt; 
Played out against the serenity of a northern wilderness tourist camp on the shores of a pristine lake, Olivia is able to salvage the pieces of her relationship with her daughter and summon the courage to venture into new relationships." />
