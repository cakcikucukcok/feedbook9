  <title>Eternal Choices - Sabrina Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever woken up one morning after years of living your life and wonder, How did I get to this point? I mean really. Was there a sign somewhere that let you know you were headed down this path? Well try being abnormal, living amongst the normal. Then try imagining what its like being abnormal and not knowing you were abnormal. On top of that, everyone else knows youre different but you just dont see it and no one was ever able to tell you just how different you really are. Thats me. All my life thats how its been and twenty five years later, Im finally getting the answers. No I still dont understand it but it does make sense.
Samia is a regular woman whose life is about to unfold to an unimaginable new world. Her life has more meaning in death than it ever did in her human life. She is thrown into a limbo with no knowledge of her past. In order for her to get out she must find out why she was sent in the first place. Uncovering some things that were hidden may affect whether she makes it out of limbo or not. Her choice may lead to others being freed from purgatory or enslaved in darkness forever." />
