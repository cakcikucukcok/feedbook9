  <title>Southern Supposition - M. John Dright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Motivated by righteous indignation, the Cleaner(Janet Jacks) has FBI&#39;s field director, Burl Cannon at wits end trying to track and tie her to a rash of friendly murders.  A world icon in her own right holds the proverbial scales of justice balanced to her personal agenda.
Imagine a Louisiana born mixed race, intelligent man who epitomizes every woman&#39;s fantasy of a Greek god; the most feared murderer for hire in North America. So much so, Miguel Wellington is simply deemed: the Professional.
Consider the possibility that the wheels of justice are greased  in Louisiana by the all might greenback, i.e. money. 
Chance that Louisiana&#39;s inmates are being murdered at an alarming rate by medical professionals  in order to harvest their organs  and sold to the highest bidder... all perpetuated by national lawmakers.
Risk the possibility that Hurricane Katrina  was a hoax; a mass murder to gain money, power and political strongholds nationwide. 
Now picture a young thirty-five year old ex-convict (John Wright) freshly released from the infamous Angola. Nicknamed Jon Jon, he is bent on doing the right thing, but is trapped in between two vicious assassins, and is the cause of the two meeting. The Dog&#39;s Den, an exclusive Bourbon Street club where forbidden sexual pleasures are commonplace is the meeting ground. The ground where three walk in but only one will walk out." />
