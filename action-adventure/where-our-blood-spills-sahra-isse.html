  <title>Where Our Blood Spills - Sahra Isse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ahmed was a solider, a good solider that was loved by his peers. But the tragic loss of his brother &amp;ndash;in- law sends him on a downward spiral. Things took a turn for the worse when he is accused of being a terrorist. When he goes looking for justice he finds himself facing a confused looking jury.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s worse: being accused of a crime you didn&amp;rsquo;t commit, or having a still-faced jury that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hear a word you say? Ahmed has been telling his story to anyone who would listen, but every time he spoke his words were left unheard. This time he is determined not to leave justice in the hands of those that are incapable of being just.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what if Ahmed is wrong? What if his actions to find justice starts a war? Someone on the jury was listening, but with hate in his eyes he was unable to see. Yes, the jurors were slow to understand but what Ahmed didn&amp;rsquo;t take in account was the jurors own struggles. Each one of the jury members has their own life struggles plus they didn&amp;rsquo;t ask to be part of a jury. The time it takes for them to put a pin in their daily struggles and focus on the case, Ahmed had already set a plan in motion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
