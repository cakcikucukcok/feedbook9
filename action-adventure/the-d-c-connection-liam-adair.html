  <title>The D.C. Connection - Liam Adair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul Blair a former Special Forces officer now a Civil Engineer was recruited by the International Court at The Hague and became the Director of the Criminal Apprehension Group of the UN. Apart from other tasks his main occupation is to bring to justice those who have had an international warrant issued for their apprehension and arrest by the Court at The Hague. To carry out any operation Blair has recruited a small very specialist team of former Special Forces.
There are other operations his team will perform, especially the rescue of UN personnel who have been taken into custody by rebel forces in the country they have been sent to help. This is about two such operations in South America. The first is concluded without too much drama. It is the second one that turns out to be almost fatal for Blair and his team.
The second operation in the same area of South America is a deliberate act to trap Blair and his team and hopefully wipe them out. 
They survive because of their skill and training, only to find out they have been sold out by rogue directors of the UN. Blair unravels this nest of vipers and brings them to justice. Again Blair and his dedicated team will hunt down these people responsible for not only taking UN volunteers hostage in South America, who have also been using the UN system to transport drugs and firearms around the world, he will have great pleasure in bringing their corrupt lives to a sudden halt. 
While engaged in these activities Paul Blair is also asked by the President of the US, to be his undercover agent outside the normal Law Enforcement agencies, to perform tasks of a sensitive nature that should not be made public. His first task is to track a prominent Washington Civil Servant, who has been systematically stealing military secrets from the Pentagon. It is the fact that this person is closely tied to the White House that is the problem. None the less Blair will bring him to justice without the knowledge of the other US law enforcement agencies." />
