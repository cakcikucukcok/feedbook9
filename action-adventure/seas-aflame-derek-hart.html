  <title>Seas Aflame - Derek Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nathan Talbot participated in the 1936 Olympics, as captain of the Tyrian Tempest, representing the United Kingdom in the 6-Meter Class Yachting races. The competition was fierce and even though Talbot was a skilled sailor, he was disappointed with only winning the Bronze Medal, outmaneuvered by the German sailing master Werner Grossman. However, there were other darker issues plaguing the young Englishman once he returned from Nazi Germany. Something sordid and dangerous was simmering underneath all the pomp and circumstance of the new Fatherland.&lt;/p&gt;
Less than four years later, Nathan&#39;s concerns were realized, as Germany plunged the world into yet another war. This time, Talbot took command of a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) and this time set sail for combat in the English Channel. Nathan was soon to discover that his old nemesis, Werner Grossman, had been given command of an entire E-boat flotilla operating in the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
Then one night, while Talbot was sneaking about Occupied France, he literally ran into 19-year-old Elise Dub and it was love at first sight. While taking daring risks to keep the flames of romance burning, Talbot was also assigned to British Intelligence. It seemed that the former yachtsman&#39;s first-hand experience with French ports would come in handy for more covert reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
There was just one problem. It also became obvious that Herr Grossman had also been captivated by Elise Dub&#39;s charms and planned to seduce her. Failing that, the German officer had every intention of forcing himself upon her. While the war at sea was often decided with lightning speed and brutal results, World War Two became incredibly personal for Nathan Talbot, who would stop at nothing to rescue his true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
