      <meta name="description" content="Once a citizen of Earth, Lieutenant Eymi Mohs has crashlanded on an unknown planet. Her spaceship went down in an area the locals call Southland. They refer to their world as Pael, and although she is unsure of her chances for long-term survival, Eymi makes her home among a tribe of women who fight to escape the yoke of male domination in their culture.
Together with her newfound friends, Eymi accepts a quest that could change the dynamic of Pael forever. The women of Southland plan to take the Long Journey of the Kings without any help from men. They travel with the kings daughter to face a powerful warlordalthough the difficult quest is but a small part of their grand trial. 
Ultimately, they must face the stone dragon responsible for the destruction of cities that do not comply with the Travertine Kings desires. Eymi and her small troupe of brave women travel alone and are pushed to their limits. However, they will face up to the feared King of the North and stand up to his wrath. The world of Pael will soon be changed forever as the incredible strength of women challenges expectations and breaks boundaries." />
