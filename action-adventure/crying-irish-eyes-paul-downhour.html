&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;To escape the devastation caused by the &quot;potato famine,&quot; Elizabeths family pools their resources in order to provide passage for her and her mother and father to sail to America, the &quot;land of milk and honey.&quot;  After enduring many hardships on the crowded, storm tossed ship, they arrive in New York and much to their surprise, they encounter tremendous prejudices against the Irish.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;After working in the smelly tanneries, Elizabeths father is bitten by &quot;gold fever&quot; as word comes that the precious metal has been discovered in California.

However, friendships are formed with other family groups and Elizabeth finally finds happiness as the wife of one of these fellow travelers.  Work in the mines is hard and dangerous and when she finds herself a widow with a small child, she migrates to Montana.  She again finds happiness as the wife of a wealthy copper mine owner.  However, she always has a yearning to return to her homeland, so when she finds herself old and alone again, she makes arrangements to gather the remains of her deceased family members together and unite them in the rocky soil of her beloved Ireland.&lt;/P&gt;" />
