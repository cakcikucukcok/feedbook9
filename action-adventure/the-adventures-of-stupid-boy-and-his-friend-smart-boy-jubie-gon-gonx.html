  <title>The Adventures of Stupid Boy and His Friend, Smart Boy - Jubie Gon Gonx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&quot;&lt;U&gt;The Adventures Of Stupid Boy And His Friend, Smart Boy&lt;/U&gt;&quot;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a bedtime storybook intended to be read to young people between the ages of 5 and 10. The book deals with the sometimes calamitous results of poor judgement, despite the counsel of a good friend. While the stories go to the brink of disaster, all turns out well and a lesson is learned. The stories are sprinkled with opportunities forfurther exploration ofa wide range of topics.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are no talking animals or abstract fantasies in the adventures of Stupid Boy. Rather, the stories involve the everyday activities of two boys who live in the same neighborhood and enjoy the same things everyelementary school childenjoys. However,even at this age, life can present opportunities for trouble, and Stupid Boy always seems to find his way into more than his share. His friend, Smart Boy, tries to keep him safe and sound, but somepeople are very headstrong. As you will see, these two friendsare very much alikein appearance, but they are very different inthe way they exercise judgement,with both questionable circumstancesand questionable people.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although these stories have done much to stimulate boys&#39; interest in reading, it must be said that girls enjoy the stories just as much as boys. As we all know, girls like to laugh at some of thedubious things boys do and they love to see boys get into trouble!After all, girls would neverput themselvesin the same predicamentsas Stupid Boy....would they?&lt;/P&gt;" />
