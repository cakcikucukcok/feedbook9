  <title>Holy Spirit Driven! - Edward J. Rishko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book contains fifty poems. All are biblically accurate; each was written within thirty to forty-five minutes. The poems address several aspects of Christianity, some with very unique and unusual perspectives. They address the shadow of death, location of the bottomless pit, why we see what we see, demonstrates that God created is true (and not evolution), why attending church is necessary, how our clergy celebrate sin, and others. Many are true stories, like how God touched the authors heart, following his prayer for a woman about to undergo serious surgery, or how, very early one morning, God spoke to him in his home (talk about having biblical experiences!). Be prepared to be educated, thrilled, surprised, choked up, and entertained by these unusual poems! The author expects that one or more of these poems will profoundly affect you to rethink some of your beliefs contained in the Bible!&lt;/p&gt;" />
