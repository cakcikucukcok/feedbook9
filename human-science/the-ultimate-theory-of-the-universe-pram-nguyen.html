  <title>The Ultimate Theory of the Universe - Pram Nguyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Modern scientists are on the verge of crises for new guidance for their research in the 21st century because of new technologies, which have shed light on new discoveries that contradict with the Standard Model and the Big Bang theory.  The Ultimate Theory of the Universe not only explains the structure of the cosmos, but also the spiritual facet that the 20th century science has never studied in depth.  This book may be used as guidance for both scientists and ordinary people to live a meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;u&gt;THE ULTIMATE THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
(THE LINK BETWEEN SCIENCE AND BUDDHISM FOR &lt;br&gt;
BETTER LIVING ON EARTH IN THE 21ST CENTURY)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	New Guidance for Research in the Twenty-First Century&lt;br&gt;
	New Book Boldly Fuses Science, Religion, and Philosophy &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* The only complete source of information on Buddhism and modern science&lt;br&gt;
* Revealed in innovative new concepts on space and time measurements!&lt;br&gt;
* Get expert guidance on searching for the truth  &lt;br&gt;
* Practical solutions to tough human problems&lt;br&gt;
* Everything you need to discover the latent potentialities within you and your environment!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE EXPLORING&lt;br&gt; 
A BROAD SPECTRUM OF LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
Unlike an animal, man requires more than mere physical comfort and needs help to cope with his frustration and miseries arising from his daily experience. We seem to have an instinctive urgent to seek the Truth, but somehow lack the capacity to find it. The dilemma of trying to set up an absolute standard is merely one of the many puzzles that have harassed mankind since the dawn of civilization. Mans search for Truth has been a never-ending obsession. The Ultimate Theory of The Universe is a bridge between modern science and Buddhism. The author had tried to use Buddhism as a compass for the people of the 21st century. It seeks to answer major questions about Buddhism relation to modern science.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
ARRANGED INTO THIRTEEN COMPREHENSIVE SECTIONS &lt;b/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It isnt fair to say that despite all the scientific progress achieved and the advantages conferred on man, science leaves the inner world basically unchanged. It has only heightened mans feeling of dependence and insufficiency, and has barely scratched the surface of mans inner world. Modern scientists are on the verge of crises for new guidance for their research in the 21st century because of new technologies, which have shed light on new discoveries that contradict with the Standard Model and the Big Bang theory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In addition to its failure to bring security to mankind, science has also made everyone feel even more insecure by threatening the world with the possibility of wholesale destruction. On the other hand, it is not difficult to understand that many of the views held in many religions regarding the cosmos and life are just conventional thoughts of which have long been superseded. It is a general truth to say that religions have greatly contributed to human development and progress. They have laid down value and standards and formulated principles to guide human life. But, for all the good they have done, religions can no longer survive in the modern scientific age if the followers insist on imprisoning truth into set forms and dogmas, on encouraging ceremonies and practices which have been depleted of their original meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
