  <title>The Intellectual Life - Philip Gilbert Hamerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This classic exploration of the intellectual life has fully retained its unique value since initial publication in 1904, and is a valuable addition to any discerning reader&#39;s collection.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No subsequent work fully compares to this rare mixture of personal insight, ethics, taste, psychology, and common sense. Philip Gilbert Hamerton bestowed upon it his long experience as a writer and artist, his enviable breadth of knowledge, and his elegance of literary style. The result is a remarkable work, expressing intimately the mind and personality of the author, yet universal in its application to all those with a love of intellectual pursuits. The publisher takes a great deal of pleasure in offering this work to the public.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The author consistently rejects simple, dogmatic views, encouraging balance and moderation. He writes, &quot;We need society, and we need solitude also, as we need summer and winter, exercise and rest.&quot; There is criticism of both aristocracy and democracy: culture leads one away from class concerns, but one must equally beware the democrat&#39;s intolerant tendency to degrade all to the least common denominator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book is organized as a series of letters addressed to individuals in a variety of situations. This permits a balanced and insightful work.&lt;/div&gt;" />
