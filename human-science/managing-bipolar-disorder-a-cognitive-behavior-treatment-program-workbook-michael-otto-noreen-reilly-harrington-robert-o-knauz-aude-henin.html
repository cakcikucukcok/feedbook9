      <meta name="description" content="If you suffer from bipolar disorder, this program can be closely integrated with the medication you are taking to help you manage your symptoms and stabilize your mood. Comprised of up to 30 sessions, this treatment is divided into four phases, each with its own focus and set of goals. In phase 1, you will learn the skills and strategies necessary for overcoming the depressive phase of your illness. In phase 2, after your mood has been stabilized, you will work together with your therapist to create a treatment contract that informs your friends and family of what to do when you are ill. In phase 3, your therapist will individualize your treatment and focus on specific problems, such as social skills, problem solving, anger management, etc. Phase 4 gives advice on the best ways to avoid relapses , and shows you how to anticipate future problems.
