  <title>Pre-Occupy-Ed - Richard Roybal Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On July 13th, 2011, Canadian-based anti-consumerist magazine, Adbusters Media Foundation, proposed the first occupation of Wall Street to demonstrate against income inequality, high unemployment, greed, as well as corruption and the influence of corporations on government. Since then, the Occupy Wall Street movement has been gaining momentum and continues to pick up steam. Attempts to quiet the protesters only expanded their influence and support. Many sympathize with the protestors ideas and understand their desire to challenge the system. However, the protestors opposition to Capitalism, support for radical wealth redistribution, and intense regulation of the private sector are threats to our economy and freedom. Occupy Wall Street does not understand their demands will not lead to improved economic conditions for the poor and middle class; it will further expand their hardships. Pre-OCCUPY-Ed investigates and exposes Occupy Wall Street and recognizes the results of their demands." />
