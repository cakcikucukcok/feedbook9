  <title>Overcoming Your Pathological Gambling:  Workbook - Robert Ladouceur, Stella Lachance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you feel as if you can no longer control your gambling, if your gambling has interfered with your family, social, or working life, this workbook can help you take back control.   Though gambling has become increasingly prevalent in society, pathological gambling is a serious condition. Pathological gamblers find they are unable to participate in their social lives, have problems at work, and end up in financial trouble because they feel compelled to keep gambling. Much of this problem comes from incorrect beliefs about the nature of the game; people believe they can beat the system or learn to control the outcome of games of chance. In this treatment, you will learn not only how to avoid problem situations, but also the truth about gambling.   Overcoming Your Pathological Gambling is written by researchers who have spent over two decades studying the psychology of gambling. This book represents the treatment they have found to be most effective at controlling the urge to gamble, understanding the true nature of gambling games, and preventing future gambling problems. Intended for use in conjunction with supervised therapy, this workbook includes various self-assessments and exercises designed to help you reach the ultimate goal of complete abstinence from gambling.  This workbook and the corresponding therapist guide form a complete treatment package that will help you overcome your gambling problem and learn recovery skills that are useful for a lifetime.  TreatmentsThatWorkTM represents the gold standard of behavioral healthcare interventions!  &lt;br/&gt;DT  All programs have been rigorously tested in clinical trials and are backed by years of research &lt;br/&gt;DT  A prestigious scientific advisory board, led by series Editor-In-Chief David H. Barlow, reviews and evaluates each intervention to ensure that it meets the highest standard of evidence so you can be confident that you are using the most effective treatment available to date &lt;br/&gt;DT  Our books are reliable and effective and make it easy for you to provide your clients with the best care available &lt;br/&gt;DT  Our corresponding workbooks contain psychoeducational information, forms and worksheets, and homework assignments to keep clients engaged and motivated &lt;br/&gt;DT  A companion website (www.oup.com/us/ttw) offers downloadable clinical tools and helpful resources &lt;br/&gt;DT  Continuing Education (CE) Credits are now available on select titles in collaboration with PsychoEducational Resources, Inc.
