  <title>Radical Honesty: How to Transform Your Life by Telling the Truth - Brad Blanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radical Honesty is not a kinder, gentler self-help book. In it, Dr. Brad Blanton, a psychotherapist and expert on stress management, explores the myths, superstitions and lies by which we all live. Blanton shows us how stress comes not from the environment, but from the self-built jail of the mind. What keeps us in our self-built jails is lying. &amp;quot;We all lie like hell,&amp;quot; Dr. Blanton says. &amp;quot;It wears us out...it is the major source of all human stress. It kills us.&amp;quot; Not telling our friends, lovers, spouses, or bosses about what we do, feel, or think keeps us locked in that mind jail. The way out is to get good at telling the truth, and Dr. Blanton provides the tools we can use to escape from that jail of the mind. This book is the cake with the file in it. This new edition includes Blanton&amp;#39;s accumulated observations since 1994 of those people whose lives have been transformed by getting out of the self-made jails of their minds to having relationships that are alive and passionate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
