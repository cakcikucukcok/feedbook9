  <title>Brain-Mind - Paul Thagard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do brains make minds? This question is one of the most challenging in science and philosophy because of the difficulty of figuring out how billions of brain cells can add up to thoughts and feelings. Paul Thagard develops a brilliant account of mental operations using promising new ideas from theoretical neuroscience. Single neurons cannot do much by themselves, but groups of neurons work together to accomplish powerful kinds of mental representation, including concepts, images, and rules.
Minds enable people to perceive, imagine, solve problems, understand, learn, speak, reason, create, and be emotional and conscious. Competing explanations of how the mind works have identified it as soul, computer, brain, dynamical system, or social construction. This book explains minds in terms of interacting mechanisms operating at multiple levels, including the social, mental, neural, and molecular.
&lt;em&gt;Brain-Mind&lt;/em&gt; presents a unified, brain-based theory of cognition and emotion with applications to the most complex kinds of thinking, right up to consciousness and creativity.  Unification comes from systematic application of Chris Eliasmith&#39;s powerful new Semantic Pointer Architecture, a highly original synthesis of neural network and symbolic ideas about how the mind works.  The book shows the relevance of semantic pointers to a full range of important kinds of mental representations, from sensations and imagery to concepts, rules, analogies, and emotions.  Neural mechanisms are used to explain many phenomena concerning consciousness, action, intention, language, creativity, and the self.
This book belongs to a trio that includes &lt;em&gt;Mind-Society: From Brains to Social Sciences and Professions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Natural Philosophy: From Social Brains to Knowledge, Reality, Morality, and Beauty&lt;/em&gt;.   They can be read independently, but together they make up a &lt;em&gt;Treatise on Mind and Society&lt;/em&gt; that provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of the cognitive sciences, social sciences, professions, and humanities." />
