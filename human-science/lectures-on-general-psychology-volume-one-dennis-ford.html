  <title>Lectures on General Psychology ~ Volume One - Dennis Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lectures on General Psychology ~ Volume One circumnavigates the world of psychology in a comprehensive and critical manner. It offers students a leisurely cruise that sails with rational flags unfurled. The itinerary commences with a consideration of the diversity and methods of psychology and proceeds to put in at the ports of memory, learning, personality and neuroscience. 
Volume One offers students a fun excursion in which Prof. Ford explains, among many tantalizing topics 
How psychology has never been a coherent science. 
How students can become educated consumers of research. 
How the memory principles of proactive and retroactive interference can enhance ones love life. 
How the positive punishment of children can become part of the shopping experience at the local mall. 
How, by pretending to be incompetent, students can make friends and influence people. 
And how, based on brain hemisphere specialization, its better for guys to whisper sweet nothings into their girlfriends right ears than into their left ears. 
There have never been lectures on general psychology like the ones in Volume One. Students are invited on board a voyage of psychological discoveries. The trip is entertaining, exhilarating, and thoroughly educational." />
