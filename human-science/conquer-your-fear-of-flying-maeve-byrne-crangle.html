  <title>Conquer Your Fear of Flying - Maeve Byrne Crangle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of Flying? Fear no more! Read this life-changing bestseller and look forward to a positive flying future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post 9/11 and following events like the MH17 Russian Plane crash and the mystery of &#39;missing flight MH370&#39; even the most intrepid air-traveller would be forgiven for feeling anxious about flying. But best-selling author, consultant Psychologist and facilitator of the world renowned &lt;i&gt;Fearless Flying Programme&lt;/i&gt; Dr Maeve Byrne Crangle reassures us in this life-changing book that although incidents, such as the attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001, reinforce people&#39;s fears of flying we must focus on the fact that millions of flights take off and land safely all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conquer Your Fear of Flying&lt;/i&gt; is a positive and empowering guide to help you overcome anxiety and panic attacks when travelling by plane. Based on &lt;i&gt;The Fearless Flying Programme&lt;/i&gt;, successfully run by Consultant Psychologist Dr Maeve Byrne Crangle, and now updated with the latest information on security screening and safety procedures at airports, this well-established book examines the many types of anxiety involved with flying and sets out a workable plan to conquer these apprehensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It offers a programme of self-management, showing the reader how to use proven stress management techniques to cope with and diffuse anxiety and panic before and during flights. Included in this third edition are sections on the power of the mind and the use of affirmations, as well as flight plans, frequently asked questions, and golden rules for fearless flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over twenty years Dr Maeve Byrne Crangle ran the &lt;i&gt;Fearless Flying Programmes&lt;/i&gt; for Aer Lingus, Ireland&#39;s national airline. Over 96% of participants in these programmes now travel more comfortably by air &amp;ndash; and enjoy the experience. Air travel remains statistically safer than crossing the road and flying has proved to be twenty-five times safer than driving your own car. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conquer Your Fear of Flying&lt;/i&gt; is the book to convince even the most faint-hearted flyers of these facts, and to help them towards a happy and fearless future with air travel&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;" />
