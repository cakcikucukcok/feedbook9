  <title>STEM Programming for All Ages - Chantale Pard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;STEM! You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of it by now: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. STEM programming took the library world by storm in 2013, and is still going strong today.

With the constant evolution in both our communities and in technology, libraries will need to make sure they stay STEM-literate in the face of these changes, so they can help their communities thrive. This book will show new and exciting examples of how libraries are implementing STEM education.
