  <title>A Stranger In My Bed: 8 Steps to Taking Your Life Back From the Contagious Effects of Your Veteran&#39;s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - Debbie Sprague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Stranger in My Bed takes you inside Debbie Sprague&#39;s life for an intimate view of a love story disrupted by the invasion of PTSD-thirty years after the Vietnam War. The cycle moves from love to fear, anger, and despair. Stories unfold of her husband&#39;s battle with PTSD, displaying typical behaviors, triggers, and moods. Those familiar with this world will be comforted: &quot;That sounds just like my life, and I thought I was the only one.&quot; Others will find a new awareness: &quot;I had no idea it was like that.&quot; You will watch a family and marriage almost be destroyed by the contagious effects of PTSD. Yes, PTSD is &quot;contagious&quot;-the family can take on the symptoms, even to the point of full-blown PTSD. Debbie was one of those people. As Debbie began to discover resources and find solutions for her problems, she realized sharing those solutions was her life purpose-what she had been preparing for her entire life.
