  <title>The Energies of Men and The Hidden Self - William James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources. In some persons this sense of being cut off from their rightful resources is extreme, and we then get the formidable neurasthenic and psychasthenic conditions, with life grown into one tissue of impossibilities, that the medical books describe. Part of the imperfect vitality under which we labor can be explained by scientific psychology. It is the result of the inhibition exerted by one part of our ideas on other parts. Conscience makes cowards of us all... The existence of reservoirs of energy that habitually are not tapped is most familiar to us in the phenomenon of &#39;second wind.&#39; Ordinarily we stop when we meet the first effective layer, so to call it, of fatigue. We have then walked, played, or worked &#39;enough&#39;, and desist. That amount of fatigue is an efficacious obstruction, on this side of which our usual life is cast. But if an unusual necessity forces us to press onward, a surprising thing occurs. The fatigue gets worse up to a certain critical point, when gradually or suddenly it passes away, and we are fresher than before...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book based on the work of James William, is published in the collection: “History of Scientific Knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;
