  <title>To Be an Agnostic - James Kirk Wall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;To Be an Agnostic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking knowledge, truth and wisdom through the philosophy of agnosticism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Chicago&lt;/b&gt;  Todays America seems to split in two opposing parties: those who feel religion is under attack, and those who feel religion is unjustly pushing itself into secular life. While many books exist that either promote or bash religion, few book explore religion and spirituality from a neutral, agnostic standpoint. Author James Kirk Wall, an agnostic himself, set out to fill this void with his new book, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Be an Agnostic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To Be an Agnostic&lt;/i&gt; neither endorses nor opposes religion. Rather, Mr. Wall takes his readers on a journey of intellectual exploration, using both ancient and modern philosophers to explain the greater meaning of life. The book teaches:&lt;/p&gt;
	an agnostic approach to problem solving&lt;/br&gt;
	solid foundations of learning and obtaining knowledge&lt;/br&gt;
	argumentation techniques&lt;/br&gt;
	decision making skills&lt;/br&gt;
	religious tolerance&lt;/br&gt;
	how to face the issue of death and dying&lt;/br&gt;
	promoting opportunity, freedom and justice&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Ultimately, this book promotes simplicity as the essence of truth, says author James Wall. Morality and ethics are regarded above all else. We must know what is good, promote what is good, and defend what is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To Be an Agnostic&lt;/i&gt; includes insight and words of wisdom from great philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle and Socrates, Eastern philosophers Confucius and Lao Tzu, Americas Founding Fathers, U.S. presidents, military commanders, religious figures, activists, celebrities, heroes and well-known agnostic thinkers such as Thomas Huxley. Without attacking or dismissing religion or faith, the book frames agnosticism as a modern bridge between religion and atheism. Readers, whether religious or not, will enjoy the opportunity to expand their horizons and increase their understanding of alternate viewpoints as it relates to matters of faith  or lack thereof." />
