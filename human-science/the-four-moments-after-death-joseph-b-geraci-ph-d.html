      <meta name="description" content="The Four Moments After Death are reflections of the stages one may go through upon losing a loved one. regardless of who they may be.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New book depicts life as a police officer during the 60s and 70s
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Author Dr. Joseph B. Geraci draws on his personal experiences as an officer during a difficult time for our country in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesdays Cop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using his diary which was written over a period of eleven years, Dr. Geraci provides a kaleidoscope of police experiences during an important era in American history. Some accounts are graphic and question the normalcy and sanity of human behavior. Veterans of law enforcement and the military will not be shocked. Rather, they will be reminded of the potentially horrific consequences of human actions.
