  <title>Identities for Life and Death - Dr. Robert J. Pellegrini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Identity is seen here as developed from narratives we assimilate as scripts for the roles we play in real life, thus shaping our destiny  for better or worse, for good or evil. Do we choose to passively, obliviously, allow our selves to be formed by whatever story lines get through to our consciousness? Or do we take an active role in deciding which story lines influence the construction or destruction of the person we become or fail to become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we choose to exercise our God-given free will to screen out narratives most likely to have a toxic, dehumanizing impact on us in favor of story lines most likely to have a creative, strengthening impact on our ability to fulfill the best of our human potential? Which of our inner wolves shall we feed? The good, moral one -- who &lt;i&gt;helps&lt;/i&gt; us become and do all the best we can be and do, or the evil, immoral one -- who strangles our creativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cumulative, self-perpetuating momentum to human development, whether toward growth through creatively-inspired, humanizing roles, or toward deterioration through toxically narratized, dehumanizing roles. This calendar provides brief, thought-provoking ideas to help make every day a creatively-inspired day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These daily messages are designed to encourage assimilation of life-oriented, creative identity-defining narrative themes as protection against death-oriented, toxic ones. Inspired by the life of Jesus Christ, the objective here is to energize and promote continuity in the experience of success and fulfillment in critical aspects of life  such as the health, image, and appearance of our body, our relationships with the people in our lives, the material abundance we manage to achieve, and the recognition we get for the work we do, all integrated by a profoundly humanizing spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
