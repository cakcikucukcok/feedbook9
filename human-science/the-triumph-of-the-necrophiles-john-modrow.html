  <title>The Triumph of the Necrophiles - John Modrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Triumph of the Necrophiles is the product of over forty years of research and is the most thorough, comprehensive, and penetrating critique of the mechanical world view ever written. Modrow meticulously traces the prescientific sources of that world view back to our Judeo-Christian heritage and to the metaphysics of Plato and Pythagoras. He documents that Plato was in fact a necrophile and that his metaphysics can best be understood as a sublimation of his necrophilia. He discusses the influence that Plato and Pythagoras had on Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo. He especially emphasizes how the necrophilic world view of Plato essentially became the world view of Galileo, Descartes, and other seventeenth- century thinkers. He also discusses how Newtons world view was shaped by his religious beliefs. 
Modrow contends that the mechanical world view is totally at odds with every major scientific advance that has occurred since the mid nineteenth century. He painstakingly explains how and why these scientific advances discredit that world view. He discusses the philosophical implications of the theory of evolution, the theory of relativity, quantum theory, Bells theorem, and Godels proof and presents an alternative world view that is more consistent with current scientific knowledge. 
In a final chilling chapter, Modrow shows where the necrophilic world view of Plato and his modern mechanistic followers are taking us." />
