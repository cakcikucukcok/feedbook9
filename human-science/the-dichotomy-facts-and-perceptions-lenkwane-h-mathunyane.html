  <title>The Dichotomy: Facts and Perceptions - Lenkwane H. Mathunyane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The contents of this handy book reflect on subjects that would enable parents, teachers and students to broaden and deepen their insight in the interdependences of human beings in the social environment.
Subjects like psychosocial development, education, religion, leadership and tradition feature prominently as indispensible interrelated life aspects that complement each other for human co-existence. 
The concept dichotomy, only seeks to highlight that in a diverse society, apart from the prevailing similarities, there are also differences; which enrich the nation and have to be appreciated and celebrated. The subject matter is structured in such a way that it is reader-friendly. Key words and or phrases used have been highlighted, explained and described in order to facilitate a mellow understanding of the subject matter.
 The educational implications in all subjects have been presented as guidance and a well crafted life - orientation towards successful teaching and learning. Syntheses have been provided in order to refresh the mind of the reader on what he had read. The author at the beginning of each chapter and some paragraphs has drawn- in the voices of great men and women, who through their powerful influence changed the world. 
This informative and educative book is compiled as a resource for students, teachers and teachers in service at the teaching and learning centres; namely, high schools, tertiary institutions, public and private colleges." />
