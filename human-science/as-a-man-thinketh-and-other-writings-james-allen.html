  <title>As a Man Thinketh and Other Writings - James Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;As a Man Thinketh&quot; has long since been regarded as a classic. This short accessible work elucidates the power of positive thinking. As James Allen writes, &quot;As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.&quot; This idea is central to the work and asserts the fact that the impetus to all good things in one&#39;s life begins and ends with the belief that good things can and will happen. Millions of people have discovered the powerful but simple wisdom of James Allen and have used it to change their outlook on life. Also contained within this volume are two other classic works by James Allen, &quot;Above Life&#39;s Turmoil&quot; and &quot;Byways of Blessedness.&quot; Begin your journey of self-improvement by putting to work the philosophies within this volume. The power of positive thinking has the potential to truly change one&#39;s life. Before one can make the changes in one&#39;s life that will lead to the happiness that one deserves there must exist the belief that those changes can and will happen. This is the power of the philosophy of James Allen. Experience it for yourself with this volume of James Allen&#39;s classic works." />
