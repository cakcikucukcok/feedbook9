  <title>Maybe I&#39;m Not Listening - Gerald Tarlow Ph. D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you currently are in therapy.
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have ever been in therapy.
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are planning to be in therapy.
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have a psychological problem.
&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, if you are a member of the human race, you must read this book!
&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Maybe I&#39;m Not Listening: Confessions of a Shrink&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Tarlow relates some of the very funny and unusual experiences he has had with patients in psychotherapy.  The book is Dr. Tarlow&#39;s candid and honest inside view of what at least one psychologist is thinking during therapy sessions.
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Tarlow gives his opinion of some very unusual symptoms presented by his therapy patients.  There is the obsessive-compulsive patient who has to eat all her food in alphabetical order. Important questions that patients ask are also included in the book.  For example, is it a good idea to consult a psychic rabbi?   Many of the issues that a psychologist deals with on a day-to-day basis are discussed.  How fees are set, boring patients, famous patients and attractive patients.
&lt;p&gt;
Each day of the book features a unique confession that no other therapist has dared to make. This book will forever change your view of the mental health professional." />
