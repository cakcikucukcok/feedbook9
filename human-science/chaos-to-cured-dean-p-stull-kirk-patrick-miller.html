  <title>Chaos to Cured - Dean P. Stull, Kirk Patrick Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The moonlight sliced into the alleyway as twenty-one-year-old Kirk Miller opened his eyes and stared at the night sky. His head throbbed as the world spun gently. The cold, hard cement felt oddly soothing, but even with all the alcohol and drugs flowing through his veins, Kirks mind was still racing. It would be a year until he was told that those feelings were related to what professionals called a manic episode. Welcome to the world of bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that bipolar disorder is one of the most misunderstood and devastating mental disorders for the diagnosed and those who care for them. But what if there were a cure? In his compelling memoir, Miller details how he was diagnosed with the most severe form of bipolar disorder, was told he would never lead a normal life, and eventually refused to accept his fate. As he began a determined search for answers through research, educated guesses, and risks that nearly cost him his life, Miller shares how he stumbled onto a new method of treating his disorder that, remarkably, helped him achieve a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chaos to Cured&lt;/i&gt; shares the true story of one mans courageous journey to finding a cure for bipolar disorder with the hope that everyone will one day have a second chance in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
