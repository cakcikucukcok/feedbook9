  <title>The Fountain of Life - Solomon ibn Gabirol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Solomon ibn Gabirol, also known as Avicebron, was a Spanish-Jewish poet and philosopher of the eleventh century and his major philosophical work is the &amp;quot;Fons Vitae&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;The Fountain of Life&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this text, Gabirol uses a Socratic dialog as a framework to discuss his theory of the &amp;#39;First Cause.&amp;#39; Written in Arabic, the Fons was translated into Latin in the 12th century, The work was attributed to &amp;#39;Avicebron,&amp;#39; who was not identified as Jewish but as Christian or possibly Muslim. One reason is that Gabirol does not reference the Tanakh or Talmud, as would be normal for a Jewish intellectual from this time and place. In addition, his neo-Platonic views seem to place him in a more Christian intellectual current. However, in 1846, a scholar named Solomon Munk announced that he had discovered that Avicebron was the same person as Gabirol.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ibn Gabirol is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all things &amp;mdash;including soul and intellect&amp;mdash;are comprised of matter and form (&amp;ldquo;Universal Hylomorphism&amp;rdquo;), and for his emphasis on Divine Will." />
