  <title>A Lifetime of Laughing and Loving with Autism: New and Revisited Stories that Will Warm and Inspire You - R Wayne Gilpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will warm your heart! A compilation of the first three Laughing and Loving with Autism books, this book contains all of your favorite stories, plus some new ones. The concept for Laughing and Loving came when R Wayne Gilpin realized how much people enjoyed the stories about his son, Alex, and his unique view of the world. Not only did people love his stories, they usually chimed in with a few of their own. This light view of autism contrasted sharply with all of the technical manuals, or doom and gloom stories that were in print at the time, so Wayne decided that THIS view needed to be shared. As a publisher, he printed up 500 copies, and hoped he could sell them within a few years. He took them to the National Autism Society of America meeting in 1993, and all 500 were gone within two days. The world needed this kind of book, and it still does. A compilation of your favorite stories from Laughing and Loving with Autism, More Laughing and Loving with Autism, and Much More Laughing and loving with Autism; this book will warm your heart while it opens up to all the great qualities our folks with autism bring to us." />
