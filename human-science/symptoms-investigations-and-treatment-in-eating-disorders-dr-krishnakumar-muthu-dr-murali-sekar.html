  <title>Symptoms, Investigations and Treatment in Eating Disorders - Dr.Krishnakumar Muthu, Dr.Murali Sekar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is about medical symptoms, signs, investigations, and interpreting the findings of the investigations. The book also contains information about the management of the blood test findings and the clinical situation, when, where, and how to treat the medical conditions. The book is designed to meet the clinical need of professionals with varying degrees of medical knowledge and expertise in a reader-friendly manner. 
The book starts with symptoms and signs of various systems in the body (e.g., gastroenterology, cardiology). Symptoms that are relevant in ED settings and the context in which they might occur has been explained; hence, the clinicians need not go through various medical textbooks to understand what the patient is presenting with. Interpreting the symptoms, understanding the blood results in the context of the symptoms, and deciding on the type and location of the intervention is what this book is about. 
Each macro- or micronutrient (e.g., potassium, magnesium, vitamins) will have the following information: 
 Functions of that element in the body (e.g., what does potassium do in the body) 
 Normal range (would be a useful guide since it includes ranges of rare blood test results, hence a quick reference guide) 
 Food that is rich in that elementuseful in offering advice to patients who show mild level of changes in the blood 
 Eating disorder specific points of interest about the micro- or macronutrient 
 High or low levels of that nutrient and when this will be observed in an eating disorder setting 
 Correlation with various levels and the treatment" />
