  <title>Principles of Equity - Henry Home, Lord Kames, Michael Lobban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;textbasic&quot;&gt;Henry Home, Lord Kames, was the complete&amp;ldquo;Enlightenment man,&amp;rdquo; concerned with the full spectrum of human knowledge and its social use. However, as a lawyer and, after 1752, as a judge on the Court of Session in Edinburgh, he made many of his most distinctive contributions through his works on the nature of law and legal development. &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Principles of Equity&lt;/I&gt;,&lt;/B&gt; first published in 1760, is considered his most lasting contribution to jurisprudence and is still cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;textbasic&quot;&gt;In his jurisprudence, Kames specifically sought to explain the distinction between the nature of equity and common law and to address related questions, such as whether equity should be bound by rules and whether there should be separate courts of law and equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;textbasic&quot;&gt;Beginning with a general introduction on the rise and nature of equity, &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Principles of Equity&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is divided into three books. The first two, &amp;ldquo;theoretical,&amp;rdquo; books examine the powers of a court of equity as derived from justice and from utility, the two great principles Kames felt governed equity.
