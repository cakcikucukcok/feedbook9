  <title>Lithium and Heroin - Phillip Graph, Frank Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Understanding mental illness and recovery is often a challenge, but Phillip Graph allows us to simultaneously explore how this occurs while also moving our hearts. Through the author&#39;s effective use of storytelling, the reader is taken on a journey to a more complete picture of various disorders and ways of coping. Through his personal disclosures and vivid descriptions, the book helps readers to explore questions that are difficult to grasp, such as how mental illness is a brain disorder, possible causes, pros and cons of various treatment approaches, underlying reasons for behaviors and reactions and even addresses the ways our culture and treatment systems help and harm. 
The book will be of benefit to students, practitioners, educators and the public alike. Using it as a guide, students may be more empowered to enter into the uncertain areas of their own questions. Practitioners will no doubt be encouraged to further build their awareness. Educators can employ the book as they teach basic theories and applications. Advocates, too, will find the book useful as it raises essential questions about the cultural norms and systems that impact mental health treatment in our country. The author succeeds in establishing an accessible framework that fosters thinking about essential questions regarding mental health care. 
As a teacher, I have read many books, and this one kept me spellbound and learning from beginning to end. I am already thinking about ways to incorporate it into my classes.
