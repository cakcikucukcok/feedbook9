  <title>Seduced by Consciousness: A Life with The Three Principles - Jack Pransky, Thomas M. Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Seduced by Consciousness&lt;/em&gt; author Dr. Jack Pransky demonstrates through entertaining stories how the Three Principles of Universal Mind, Consciousness and Thought work together to create everyone&amp;#39;s unique &amp;quot;reality,&amp;quot; out of which they then think, feel and act. Defying description, this captivating, profound book has been depicted as part self-help manual, part spiritual autobiography, in which the author uses his own life experiences and those of his clients in a revealing, raw and honest manner to contrast the difference between the peace, love, joy and wisdom that occur when these Principles are realized in one&amp;#39;s life, and the suffering that occurs when this understanding remains unrealized or forgotten. The question is asked: Will we be trapped in the illusions of our own creation, or will we fall back into our true spiritual nature and essence? This book creates a special opportunity for readers to have insights that reveal the answer, and this will change lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jack Pransky, Ph.D. is founder/director of the Center for Inside-Out Understanding.
