  <title>The Art &amp; Craft of Writing Christian Fiction: The Complete Guide to Finding Your Story, Honing Your Skills, &amp; Glorifying God in Your Novel - Jeff Gerke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it: Christian fiction is fun. Even if you&#39;re writing a serious-minded study of man&#39;s inhumanity to man, there is something exhilarating about story; about creating people and worlds and events; about telling a tale that keeps readers enraptured and maybe - just maybe - leaves them fortified in their walk with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for all of the fun, it&#39;s also hard work. There is skill involved in writing excellent Christian fiction. There is craftsmanship to be learned. And there are the long hours pounding away on a manuscript that, by the time you&#39;re done with it, has you convinced it&#39;s the worst piece of garbage ever penned by man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not even talking about trying to get your book published. It&#39;s a wonder anyone would choose such a way to spend otherwise useful time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So maybe you put your novel away for awhile. You&#39;ve tried to do more sensible things with your spare moments. You&#39;ve attempted to be engaged with workaday matters, laundry, and bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one day, a new story idea will pop into your head or you won&#39;t be able to stop hearing the voice of a character demanding to be written about. On that day, you&#39;ll be right back where you were, counting the cost of writing Christian fiction - and loving it like nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
