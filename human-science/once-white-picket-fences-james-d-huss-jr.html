  <title>Once White Picket Fences - James D. Huss Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My friends and family seem not to know of my verses, my verse writing was unlike my action adventure novels of my off road racing days in Mexico. It gave me pleasure forming verses into the biography of my life, which could be shared with others. 
My verses suggest that I may have been a closed hopeless romantic, only subject to the verses I wrote for even the girl next door can tell by the reflections of my heart. Whether its true or distorted, it can be passed through generations or the common reader. I was wise enough to know that there was certain fun in the forming and publishing. 
There are extremes of mood in my verses, at one extreme is in beneath me, always, and winged path, first describes my first love and the second projects the day we met, and the loss after she left. 
And serious grim in Blasphemy, is the catastrophe that befell on me after my autistic sons mother denied him. A loss for my children, having a mother periodically coming into their lives a couple times a year. A couple of my other themes Saplings and Heaven are of the happiness and joy of my two youngest children laughing and smiling onto the world. Between these extremes of mood comes depression. Into me, is a verse coming from my past loves in and out of my children and my lives. 
There is an occasional note of explanation or background in my verses. As in the verse Thayer I had hoped that one day to return to white picket fences in the mid west, so I could live in peace love and happiness in my forty years remained." />
