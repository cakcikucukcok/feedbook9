  <title>EMDR - Francine Shapiro, Margot Silk Forrest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When &lt;I&gt;EMDR&lt;/I&gt; was first published in 1997, it was hailed as the most important method to emerge in psychotherapy in decades. In the twenty years since, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy has successfully treated psychological problems for millions of sufferers worldwide. In this updated edition, Francine Shapiro offers a new introduction that presents the latest applications of this remarkable therapy, as well as new scientific data demonstrating its efficacy. Drawing on the experiences of thousands of clinicians as well as a vast research literature on depression, addiction, PTSD, and other disorders, she explains&lt;BR&gt;how life experiences are physically stored in our brains, making us feel and act in harmful ways, and how EMDR therapy can bring relief, often in a remarkably short period of time. Applicable to survivors of trauma as well as people suffering from phobias and other experience-based disorders, &lt;I&gt;EMDR&lt;/I&gt; is essential reading for anyone who seeks to understand why we hurt, how we heal, and how we get better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
