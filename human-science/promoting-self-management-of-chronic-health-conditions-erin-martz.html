  <title>Promoting Self-Management of Chronic Health Conditions - Erin Martz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is common for a doctor or healthcare professional to see an individual with a chronic health condition only a few times a year for a brief office appointment. Yet, the individual has to live with the health condition 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So, who really is in charge of managing the health condition? The individual has to &quot;micro-manage&quot; their condition, while healthcare professionals can provide advice on treatment approaches or the &quot;macro-management&quot; of the chronic health condition.
&lt;em&gt;Promoting Self-Management of Chronic Health Conditions&lt;/em&gt; covers a range of topics related to self-management-theories and practice, interventions that have been scientifically tested, and information that individuals with specific conditions should know (or be taught by healthcare professionals). Data suggest that currently a majority of individuals in the U.S. has a chronic health condition, and as society ages and healthcare continues to improve individuals&#39; life-spans, more people will experience a chronic health condition. Health systems need to shift from an acute care model of treatment to a chronic care treatment model, in view of this trend. The expanding need for the development and scientific analysis of formal self-management programs accompany this increase in chronic health conditions. This book serves the critical purpose of helping to increase understanding of self-management and how healthcare providers can empower individuals with chronic health conditions to self-manage." />
