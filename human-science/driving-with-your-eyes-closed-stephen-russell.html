  <title>DRIVING WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED - Stephen Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I tend to suffer from compulsive liberationist tendencies &amp;ndash; in other words, I&amp;rsquo;m a natural-born liberator &amp;ndash; so I hope reading this book serves to set you free of anything holding you back from transforming your own life into the most magnificent adventure imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say I&amp;rsquo;m a supercharged Taoist because for more than 35 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been training in Taoist martial arts, qigong, and meditation. Just as it promised in the instruction leaflets, these practices have generated an accumulation of supercharged energy that courses through me and everything I do. This makes my life exciting, endlessly varied, and full of adventure. Using the ancient Taoist wu-wei manifesting methods &amp;ndash; focusing on being, not doing, and intending things into existence rather than trying to force them &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m able to create reality as I wish it to be, almost instantaneously. I say this humbly. Also, by letting the Taoist philosophy underscore everything I think, do, and say, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to be flexible in my thinking. Flexibility lets me enjoy all aspects of the ride to the fullest, whether in an up phase or a down one. I feel blessed by all this and want to share my good fortune with you. I want you, in your own style, to be blessed in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a desire to share the wonder of the Tao with others. That&amp;rsquo;s been my motivation for as long as I can remember. I have an enthusiasm for it, a childlike exuberance that carries me through life in a way that uplifts and cheers me. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that over the years my exuberance has helped others feel exuberant too. That is how I want this book to leave you feeling, and I want all of Britain and the whole world beyond to feel exuberant too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
