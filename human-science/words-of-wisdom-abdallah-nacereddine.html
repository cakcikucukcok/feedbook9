  <title>Words of Wisdom - Abdallah Nacereddine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From a very young age, Abdallah Nacereddine was known for his Words of Wisdom; not amusing, childish, or witty words, but something very wise and solemn.  Family members, relatives and neighbors even reminded him of them many years later. But in an illiterate society, no one recorded them in writing.  &lt;br&gt;
It was only in the 1960s, thanks to the books he read, mainly on Western philosophy, that Abdallah Nacereddine started to write down his thoughts and reflections.  They were an immediate success among his circle of friends and acquaintances, and he published three books from 1967 to 1970.  During trips to Japan, his writings in English and French were very much appreciated and translated into Japanese for publication in literary reviews.&lt;br&gt;
After teaching Arabic and producing textbooks for many years, Abdallah Nacereddine started writing again.  He produced a new book in 2004, and published his Words of Wisdom in English, Arabic and French on his website.  Thanks to their success, this book is published to bring to another audience his writings in English in the form of couplets.  An Index gives the reader access to their themes, from Good, Life, and Love to Man, Woman, Suffering and Healing.&lt;br&gt;" />
