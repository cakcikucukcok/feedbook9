  <title>Dialogically Speaking: Maurice Friedman&#39;s Interdisciplinary Humanism - Kenneth Paul Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What makes us authentically human? According to Maurice Friedman, world-renowned Martin Buber scholar, translator, and biographer, it is genuine dialogue. When there&#39;s a willingness for dialogue, Friedman says, then one must &#39;navigate&#39; moment-by-moment. It&#39;s a listening process. Friedman addresses our humanity in ever-unique ways through his dialogue with philosophy, literature, religion, and psychotherapy. At least two things make this book new. Friedman presents his wide-ranging thought directly in five original essays forming an intertextual compass, which is then elaborated upon by colleagues familiar with his work. Second, a special feature of this book is found at the end of each part which invites readers to engage with questions drawn from and pointing toward Friedman&#39;s writing. The book&#39;s intended audience includes teachers, scholars, and students interested in dialogical approaches to any of the human sciences. In a time when we are in danger of losing our human birthright, Friedman&#39;s interdisciplinary insights point us again to the touch of the other." />
