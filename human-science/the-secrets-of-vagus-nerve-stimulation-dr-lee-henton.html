  <title>The Secrets of Vagus Nerve Stimulation - Dr. Lee Henton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Are you aware there is an essential nerve in your body called the vagus nerve, which has a significant impact on your overall health? Do you know that stimulating this nerve can be the solution to many health conditions and diseases that plagues humanity? Are you willing to improve your health and overall wellbeing once and for all? If so, then read on&amp;hellip; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The vagus nerve is not only the longest but also the most important nerve that runs in your body. It carries vital signals to and from your brain, heart, lungs, digestive system, and other major organs in your body. Should any damage be done to this nerve by your poor, unhealthy lifestyle, uncontrolled daily stress, or injury, you stand a high risk of being plagued by chronic inflammation, anxiety, depression, PTSD, digestive problems, heart diseases, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To give you a perspective, the World Health Organization in 2019 reported that about 263 million people globally suffer from depression, and this number is on the increase. In the US alone, the National Institute of Mental Health in its last report estimated that 17.3 million adults (7.1% of all US adults) had at least a major depressive episode, not to mention it costs the US billions of dollars annually to treat people with epilepsy, which is reported to have affected 1.3 million people in the US, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Now more than ever, it has become increasingly important to take back your mental wellbeing and overall health through conscious efforts in stimulating the vagus nerve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vagus nerve stimulation has shown tremendous science-backed results not just in treatment-resistant depression or epilepsy but has also been found helpful in treating other mental disorders such as PTSD and bipolar disorder, anxiety, chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, heart failures, migraines, and cluster headaches among others. And more interestingly, you can apply certain natural exercises and practices that are completely inexpensive but yet proven to be highly effective in treating these health conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps you are experiencing one or more of the health defects mentioned, not to worry because this book would:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide you with deeper insights on what the vagus nerve is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explain the several important functions performed by the vagus nerve in the human body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enlighten you on several health conditions and diseases that are linked to a damaged vagus nerve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reveal certain substances and lifestyle habits that can damage your vagus nerve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Educate you on why your gut health is vital to your vagus nerve and what you can do to live a gut-healthy lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explain what a vagal tone is, its importance to your health, and how to measure and increase your vagal tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Describe science-backed natural exercises, practices, and methods you can start right away to stimulate your vagus nerve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Show you some recommended food and dietary supplements you should take for a healthy vagus nerve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Help you unlock the power of your vagus nerve to heal your body from health conditions and diseases such as chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), anxiety, depression, epilepsy, PTSD, constipation, chronic stress, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Empower you to take full control of your health and overall wellbeing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And much more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your decision to gain health and get back to a state of mental balance has led you to this book. Listen to that part of yourself rather than the apprehensions that are keeping you from a healthier and happier life.&amp;nbsp;If you want the key to unlock the power of your vagus nerve to heal your body, then get a copy of this book right away." />
