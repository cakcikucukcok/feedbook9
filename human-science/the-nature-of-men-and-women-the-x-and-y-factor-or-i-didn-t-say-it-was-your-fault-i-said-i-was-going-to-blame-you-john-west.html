  <title>The Nature of Men and Women, the X and Y Factor, or I Didn’T Say It Was Your Fault, I Said I Was Going to Blame You - John West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is a humorous, semi-scientific guide to understanding the nature of men and women. It is a helpful source for navigating the ins and outs of interactions with the opposite sex. The book starts with the beginning of sex, goes through nature and nurture to a description of men and women, and finally, to marriage and beyond. You will find checklists, quizzes, and a road map through the perils and pleasures of finding a mate. Included are interesting facts, figures, and advice from poets, writers, and romance experts. Whether you are twenty or fifty, you will find this book a wonderful resource for the affairs of the heart. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;John West has hit a perfect bullseye with this book. It will have you laughing as you discover what makes relationships work or falter in the complicated dance of romance. I wish I had read it before stepping into various relationships. West thoughtfully describes the inner workings of our brains, the hormonal and cultural influences that make us who we are, and how all that plays a major role when we try to engage with others. If you think it isn&#39;t possible to find the perfect mate, read this book, it makes you realize the type of person you are best suited for and helps you understand the changes you need to make to be a perfect partner. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;P&gt;This book should be on all book shelves. It is scientific, it is insightful, and it is hilarious. John West captures the essence of being male and female in this modern world. He explains our habits and idiosyncratic behavior in easy to understand chapters but brings you to tears with his insightfulness. I cannot recommend this tome highly enough, an excellent read. Best book on the sexes I have encountered. You are learning as well as being entertained. A must read, helpful for all marriages. Superb understanding of science and human nature. You will never view the opposite sex the same after reading this book. A bloody good read. &lt;br /&gt;
