  <title>All in One Easy Reader - Rebecca A. Vorsah  Bed (Arts)  Med, Jones Y. Assor, Josephine Y. Assor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The content of this resourceful book contains reading educative and interesting short stories, poems, speech work, phonetics, grammar, vocabulary building, literature, picture description, and lots of exercises. Children can recite any of the poems during class competition or inter- schools competition. These will equip them to be innovative and creative.
Reading is a very good skill that children must acquire through consistent practice. Those who read regularly gain the necessary skills and read skillfully in class and in public. Everything is simplified to make reading enjoyable. The pictures in the book capture the attention of the young learners thereby making learning an interesting experience.
Reading, writing, and understanding are key elements in the development of children. If children attend school regularly but cannot read, write, and understand anything, it is not the best.
With the help of this book, pupils from primary four onwards can read easily without any difficulty. There are simple words with their phonetic pronunciations. The words are pronounced according to their syllables.
Above all, there are lots of exercises in the book that will keep them busy and active. It is our hope that children who will use this book would perform better in class and in their final examinations." />
