  <title>From Pieces To Peace - Selone Ajewole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining Psychotherapy and Faith in Your Quest for Lasting Peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever felt like your search for peace has left you shattered into a million pieces? With all life has to throw at us, you are definitely not alone. This book has been written for anyone on a quest for peace within five key areas of their life. Internal peace, as well as peace in your health, relationships, career and finances is now all within reach. Uniquely formulated from the knowledge and expertise of a qualified Psychotherapist and a Pastor, this book allows the reader to identify and pre-empt peace-robbing scenarios and provides the necessary tools to quickly reinstate it. By combining psychotherapeutic technique, clinical examples, practical methodology, candid personal experience and the application of Christian principles, individuals are empowered to both cultivate and maintain a profound sense of peace, despite the inevitable challenges life will deal. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akin to the therapeutic relationship, the author walks with you whilst it&amp;rsquo;s dark, at your pace, without judgment, illuminating reflective thinking, which in turn enables you to see and manoeuvre towards the light and ultimately, peace. If you are ready to glue the pieces of your life back together, come, let&amp;rsquo;s synchronise our efforts, as we journey on, from pieces to peace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What People Are Saying About The Book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selone Ajewole offers the seemingly impossible: a systematic, thoughtful and personal consultation from the pages of her book. She combines technical know-how on CBT and psychotherapy, with, at times painfully personal reflection and insight into our daily struggles. Selone pulls no punches, and her insights will make you feel uncomfortable, but in that safe way only a gifted therapist can. So sit down, avoid distractions, and with prayerful meditation, begin with her a journey to a more peaceful, whole you, you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Adam Ibrahim DipProfDev, BSc, MBBS, DipCBT Clinical Psychiatrist and former GP Registrar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book From Pieces to Peace is striking in its ability to not only bring clarity on mental health issues that could have confused many Christians but also provides practical solutions to many overlooked yet common emotional and mental health concerns. Pastor Selone has drawn from her wealth of knowledge, bridging the gap between scriptures and everyday challenges faced by individuals from all walks of life. Great and easy read!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimi Ajala Author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Life God Has For You: Stop Living Less Than You Are.&amp;rdquo; Director of Mimi Ajala Ministries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Pieces to Peace is true to life, and uncovers ways in which you can access peace regardless of your own life story. This book provides warm and wisdom filled insight into a journey that we should all go on. Ultimately, the words on these pages feel a bit like therapy but in book form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melissa Nankoo Pharmacist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Pieces to Peace: Finding Peace in 5 Key Areas of Your Life captures the steps required to achieve peace from past anxieties. By highlighting how we can often engage in destructive thinking without being aware of it, this book uses scripture and practical psychotherapeutic steps to illustrate how we can combat this Negative Automatic Thinking (NATs) for good. Overall, it helps to start a journey into healthy positive thinking that can alter our spiritual, physical and emotional lives thus helping us to experience peace, pushing us one step closer to achieving our full purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pastor Ryan A. Johnson Senior Pastor of Awaken Church&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
