  <title>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression, Second Edition - John Teasdale, Zindel V. Segal, Mark Williams, Jon Kabat-Zinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This acclaimed work, now in a new edition, has introduced tens of thousands of clinicians to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for depression, an 8-week program with proven effectiveness. Step by step, the authors explain the &amp;quot;whys&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how-tos&amp;quot; of conducting mindfulness practices and cognitive interventions that have been shown to bolster recovery from depression and prevent relapse. Clinicians are also guided to practice mindfulness themselves, an essential prerequisite to teaching others. More than 40 reproducible handouts are included. Purchasers get access to a companion website featuring downloadable audio recordings of the guided mindfulness practices (meditations and mindful movement), plus all of the reproducibles, ready to download and print in a convenient 8 1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; size.

Includes studies of adaptations for treating psychological and physical health problems other than depression.&lt;BR /&gt; *Audio files of the guided mindfulness practices, narrated by the authors, on two separate Web pages--one for professionals, together with the reproducibles, and one just for clients.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; See also the authors&amp;#39; related titles for clients: &lt;I&gt;The Mindful Way through Depression&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates these proven strategies in a self-help format, with in-depth stories and examples. &lt;I&gt;The Mindful Way Workbook&lt;/I&gt; gives clients additional, explicit support for building their mindfulness practice, following the sequence of the MBCT program.
