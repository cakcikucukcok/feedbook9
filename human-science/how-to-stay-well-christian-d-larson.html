  <title>How to Stay Well - Christian D. Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1912, Larson&amp;acute;s &amp;quot;How to Stay Well&amp;quot; Larson shows a new way to perfect health, claiming that there are many systems of healing, and their number is growing steadily, but there is no single system in existence as yet that is based on all the laws of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Life is too important to be cut short on account of prejudice, ignorance or narrow-mindedness; and the joy of living a large and full life is so great that no one should for a moment be deprived of its pleasure. The new age demands completeness, the best of everything for everybody, the removing of all barriers, that all truth from all sources may minister to all minds. And when all minds will come together and work in such a spirit, the full emancipation of the race will be at hand, and the coming of a fairer day will no longer be a dream. But it is all possible, and what is possible will surely come to pass. With this spirit in mind the author outlines what he considers to be a complete system of prevention and cure - a system that can bring health to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Christian Daa Larson was an American New Thought leader and teacher, as well as a prolific author of metaphysical and New Thought books. He is credited by Horatio Dresser as being a founder in the New Thought movement." />
