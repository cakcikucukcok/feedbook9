  <title>Entering Your Own Heart: a Guide to Developing Self Love, Inner Peace and Happiness - Carole J. Morton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Take a journey to the center of your heart where you will see, appreciate and understand that you have always loved -- and still do love -- your self, perhaps more than you imagine. In recognizing this, you will not only treat your self with the love and appreciation you deserve, you will accept no less from anyone else and offer no less to others.&lt;br /&gt;
When consciously connected with this love, peace rather than hurt, anger, anxiety or depression will be maintained. Experience the joy of living in full acceptance of what is, and empowered to create a better life for yourself and your world. This eye opening, step-by-step, guide is for readers of all ages and sensibilities. &lt;br /&gt;
Healing professionals will also gain greater insight into the healing process detailed in this comprehensive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering Your Own Heart is a significant work in helping people heal and awaken. Mortons insight, wisdom, compassion and strength, having taken such a full journey herself, is inspiring and has been a great help to me. &lt;br /&gt;
Gail Stepanek, Professor of Yoga &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering Your Own Heart has helped me so much. I am now experiencing more love for myself and others.&lt;br /&gt;
Monica Neurad, Business Owner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on 33 years of professional experience and her own life experiences, Morton has written an eye-opening book for all true seekers of lifes biggest questions.&lt;br /&gt;
