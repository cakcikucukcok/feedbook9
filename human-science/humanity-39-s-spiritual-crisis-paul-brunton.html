  <title>Humanity&#39;s Spiritual Crisis - Paul Brunton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the twenty-first century unfolds, our world faces dire political, ethical, ecological, and spiritual challenges on a global scale. How are we to understand the crises that are affecting us all?
Paul Brunton’s Humanity&#39;s Spiritual Crisis spells out how  today&#39;s widespread, confusing, and many-layered crisis is essentially a spiritual one—and one that we ignore to our peril—we must undertake a major step forward in our evolution as a species. He provides a deeply informed framework of spiritual understanding and practices that help us find the most effective and creative ways to address these momentous situations in our daily lives.
Brunton was well aware of the potential for disaster in the contemporary world. He had witnessed the two world wars and recognized the increasing danger of a nuclear holocaust. First appearing in 1952, Humanity&#39;s Spiritual Crisis, offers the only sure way to heal our society, and our planet—by awakening enough individuals to transform themselves and their world. 
He writes, “I had been allowed a peep behind the curtain of world events, behind the present pattern of the human scene on this planet, and there was a real necessity for knowledge of it, if all of us were not to go down into the gravest catastrophe. The population explosion, the poisoned environment, and the poisoned mental and emotional climate—the crisis I alluded to in Humanity&#39;s Spiritual Crisis, written more than [half] a century ago, has not only worsened but spread everywhere.”
Humanity&#39;s Spiritual Crisis makes it clear that we cannot build a new and better world until we have looked within, found the soul&#39;s light to guide us, and made unavoidable inner changes. We can choose to consciously co-operate with the inner purpose of this crisis and intelligently participate in it to our own benefit. If, however, we blindly resist or lazily delay, we will suffer the consequences.
“Paul Brunton was a man ahead of his times. He was a brilliant, sensitive, philosophical thinker, a spiritual man and a writer of great talent. On re-visiting the words and works of this most thoughtful of men, one is struck by the fact that spiritual philosophy, the heart of his subject matter, may change its guises with the times, but its truths are essentially and utterly timeless.”—Linda George, Conscious Life News" />
