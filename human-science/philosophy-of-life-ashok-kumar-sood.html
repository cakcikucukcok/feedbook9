  <title>Philosophy of Life - Ashok Kumar Sood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rationality can answer a number of the most central questions about our existence and our universe: Why are we here? How did the universe come into existence and how will it end? What is the purpose and where will we go after death?
In Philosophy of life - Connecting Dots, author Ashok Kumar Sood explores a rational and analytical approach to answer these fundamental questions about human nature and existence and he looks to the facts about our universe and about human psychology to find rational answers.  Philosophy of life starts with a curiosity and uses a methodology grounded in rationality to investigate both the physical aspects of the universe as well as the psychological aspects of the human mind.  It further explores the role of perception and imagination in human life and it shows how maintaining physical, mental, social and environmental health can improve quality of life.
While religion and spirituality have offered traditional answers to life`s most important questions, a rational approach grounded in the facts of our existence can provide a more concrete foundation for optimal living.  Philosophy of life  connecting dots can show you how to use this rationality to accomplish the ultimate goals of life and live with tranquility, happiness and satisfaction." />
