  <title>Theraplay: Innovations in Attachment-Enhancing Play Therapy - Evangeline Munns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theraplay is a form of structured play therapy designed to strengthen the attachment between parents and their child. Dr. Evangeline Munns, a Theraplay therapist and trainer, introduces this treatment method in its traditional format of individual child and parent sessions. Its simple, action-oriented, and visual activities are presented in an atmosphere of playfulness and fun, designed to easily engage both parent and child. The adaptability of this approach has led to its innovative application in working with various populations (failure to-thrive infants, sexually abused children), within various formats (siblings, families, multi-families, groups), and in various settings (private practice, mental health centers, schools). Emphasizing enhanced self-esteem, trust, and confidence, Theraplay techniques are clearly and creatively presented with rich clinical detail in this volume." />
