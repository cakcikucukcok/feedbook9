  <title>The Valley - Joan MacLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Eighteen-year-old Connor, an aspiring author whose fantastical stories foretell his growing struggle with depression, can&amp;#8217;t wait to be free of his adverb-wielding, solve-it-all mother, Sharon. But six weeks after leaving for university, he drops out and returns home.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dan Mulano is an infatuated new dad and well-meaning police officer whose selfishness is veiled by the lofty aspirations he holds for his family. His wife, Janie, a former addict and exhausted new mom, struggles to cope with the challenges of recovery in the midst of her battle with postpartum depression, which Dan dismisses as &amp;#147;just hormones.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A precipitous incident brings the two families together. When Connor&amp;#8217;s erratic behaviour at an underground train station requires police intervention, Dan responds to the call and makes the arrest, but the teen&amp;#8217;s jaw is broken during the incident. Is it police brutality or self-harm? For Sharon, there is no question; she portrays Dan as a reckless cop in the media, while he remains silent, refusing to break protocol and&lt;BR&gt;tell his story.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inspired by an event in British Columbia that shattered the public&amp;#8217;s confidence in the police &amp;#150; the 2007 Tasering death of Robert Dziekanski during his arrest at the Vancouver airport &amp;#150; &lt;I&gt;The Valley&lt;/I&gt; dramatizes the volatile relationship between law enforcement and people in the grip of mental illness. In addressing this fraught relationship, award-winning playwright Joan MacLeod empathizes with both parties, each of whom is guided by good intentions but equally challenged by their own cultural biases and flawed humanity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
