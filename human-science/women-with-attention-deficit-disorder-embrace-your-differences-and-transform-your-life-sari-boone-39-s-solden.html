  <title>Women With Attention Deficit Disorder: Embrace Your Differences and Transform Your Life - Sari Boone&#39;s Solden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Women with Attention Deficit Disorder, psychotherapist Sari Solden&amp;#39;s, groundbreaking book, explains how every year, millions of withdrawn little girls and chronically overwhelmed women go undiagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder because they don&amp;#39;t fit the stereotypical profile: they&amp;#39;re not fast-talking, hyperactive, or inattentive, and they are not male.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This pioneering book explores treatment and counseling options, and uses real-life case histories to examine the special challenges women with AD/HD face, such as the shame of not fulfilling societal expectations. Solden explains that AD/HD affects just as many women as men, and often results in depression, disorganization, anxiety, and underachievement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Included in this revised edition is a brand new chapter on friendship challenges for women with AD/HD. Three empowering steps &amp;mdash; restructuring one&amp;#39;s life, renegotiating relationships, and redefining self-image &amp;mdash; help women take control of their lives and enjoy success on their own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Sari Solden has used her personal and professional experience to shine some light into the dark closet inhabited by far too many ADD women... She empowers ADD women by validating their experience as worthwhile human beings who struggle with serious organizational problems in many areas of their lives.&amp;quot; (Kate Kelly and Peggy Ramundo, authors of You Mean I&amp;#39;m Not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy&amp;quot;)" />
