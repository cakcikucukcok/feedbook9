  <title>Hello to All That - John Falk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An off-the-wall, heartbreaking, and often hilarious memoir of a correspondent reporting from the front lines while also battling his lifelong nemesis-chronic depression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His own chemistry was his worst enemy, and it took John Falk to some very strange places-from Garden City, Long Island, to sniper-infested Sarajevo during the Bosnian bloodbath. But through it all, in the face of chronic depression, he kept reaching out for the life he&#39;d always wanted. &lt;i&gt;Hello to All That&lt;/i&gt; is his story-crazed, comic, poignant, suspenseful, hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falk was an average Long Island kid, until depression left him ashamed and trapped behind an impenetrable chemical wall. Barely surviving on &quot;chin-up&quot; tips from his big, loyal, boisterous family, Falk tried to fight his disease-or hide it. But by twenty-four, he was alone, living on books by war correspondents, their adventures his only escape. Then he found a blue pill called Zoloft and set out on a mission to make his own name as a correspondent during one of the most dangerous conflicts in recent memory. Falk&#39;s journey has never been predictable, and neither is his moving, outrageous, and sometimes frightening memoir. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the riveting tale of a man&#39;s lifelong battle-the struggle to defeat his greatest enemy and to connect, cure himself, and finally live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
