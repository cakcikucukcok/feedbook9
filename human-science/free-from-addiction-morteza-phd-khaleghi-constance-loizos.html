  <title>Free from Addiction - Morteza PhD Khaleghi, Constance Loizos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Addiction invades every region and demographic in the United States, affecting more than 23 million Americans and putting families though a heartbreaking cycle of recovery and relapse. Many people give up and never find the right treatment that will enable them to break free of their addiction forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a radical new approach, clinical psychologist Dr. Morteza Khaleghi argues that the vast majority of drug and alcohol addiction is driven by an emotional trauma. A pioneer of the dual diagnosis recovery program, he treats the body for chemical dependency while simultaneously ministering to the emotional block that serves as a trigger for relapse. A regular advisor on the Dr. Phil show, Dr. Khaleghi has mapped out recovery plans for thousands of patients and their families.  Well-known facilities such as Hazelden, Sierra Tucson, and the Betty Ford Center refer their toughest cases to him, looking to his vast experience and high rate of success. In this groundbreaking book, he teaches you the methods that have made him the therapist that other therapists turn to for advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families will learn how to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Recognize addictive behavior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Plan and stage effective interventions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Work on the family dynamics that enable addiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients will learn to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Become self aware about addictive behavior &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Identify the emotional trauma that is at the heart of nearly every addiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o           Detect early signs of relapse and take preemptive measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on over 20 years of experience healing patients, Dr. Khaleghi&#39;s insightful, nurturing and-- above all--breakthrough book is geared to anyone looking for help with dependency and to the spouses, parents, children, and friends who bear the brunt of this damaging disease. &lt;i&gt;Free from Addiction&lt;/i&gt; will redefine addiction treatment and provide new hope to all those embarking on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
