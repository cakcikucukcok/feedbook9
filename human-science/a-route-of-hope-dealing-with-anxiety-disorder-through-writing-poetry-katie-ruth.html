  <title>A ROUTE OF HOPE - dealing with Anxiety Disorder through Writing &amp; Poetry - Katie Ruth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you appreciate poetry, you will be encouraged by this collection of poems. It is an excellent resource for finding hope in the midst of suffering from a mental disorder (anxiety), supported by Scripture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About the Author: Katie Ruth was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder in 2005. She spent years searching for support groups that would bring together her interest in mental health support and her faith as a Christian.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then she found Fresh Hope. During her early years of living with anxiety, Katie found release in writing poetry that reflected her developing faith and her progress through God. She writes, &amp;ldquo;I hope this book may be an encouragement for anyone suffering with anxiety. I hope the poems bring a glimpse of the comfort, direction, and pure love that God has for us.&amp;rdquo; Now able to face the world head-on, these poems trace her route of recovery, eventually enabling her to live a life of normality. Katie lives in Portsmouth, England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is broken down into the stages of Katie&amp;#39;s journey. Each stage has a number of poems which address her journey through that stage. The stages are:&lt;br /&gt;
Nature&lt;br /&gt;
Struggles&lt;br /&gt;
Pure Love&lt;br /&gt;
Perserverance&lt;br /&gt;
Celebration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever suffered from, or are currently suffering from anxiety attacks, then download this book, because its message will speak to you and help lead you through the stages from hopelessness, through perseverance to hope thereby improving your mental health.&lt;br /&gt;
If you know someone who has, or is, suffering from anxiety attacks, then download a copy and send this book to them for the same reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Katie Ruth has spoken to mental health sufferers all over the United Kingdom and has also done a number of engagements in the USA. To book Katie Ruth, contact her at katie@anderson.info&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;REVIEWS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In her mother&amp;rsquo;s own words: &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;The gift of writing enabled her to track &lt;b&gt;a route of hope &lt;/b&gt;on the journey to recovery.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find a disarming charm and sincerity that allows grace to take you unawares. the truth is simple - God is very close and He loves us. His love is what our hearts need to be healed. Katie&amp;#39;s poems remind us of these most essential truths and they make us smile....because suddenly we know - this is true and she has lived it.&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah de Nordwall&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A bard with a bard school &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;ve ever wanted proof that there&amp;#39;s truly a light at the end of the tunnel - &lt;i&gt;Katie Ruth&lt;/i&gt; is it!&lt;br /&gt;
