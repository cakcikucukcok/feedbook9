  <title>Anatomy of Attitudes - David A. Brown, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains a collection of writings by Dr. David Brown for his students, patients and family.  The unifying purpose to the collection is in turning self-defeating attitudes into those more in one&#39;s best interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Dr. Brown holds a Master&#39;s Degree in Counseling and a Ph.D. in Human Behavior.  He is board certified by the National Academy of Certified Mental Health Counselors and the National Board of Certified Counselors.  Having previously been a private practice family psychologist, and director of an adolescent drug rehab center, Dr. Brown is currently a Professor at Hodges University in Fort Myers, Florida.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
His experience stems from more than forty years of successful encounters with troubled teens, couples with marital problems, managers &#39;unable to cope&#39;, and individuals with substance addiction, anxiety and depression.  He has lectured nationally on topics such as stress management, Rational Emotional Behavior Therapy (REBT), and the rational use of hypnosis.  He has presented workshops on rational living, stress management, conflict resolution and problem solving to industrial managers, school psychologists, college students, counselors and administrators with exciting success.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
This book is meant to cause human beings to think seriously about themselves and the world around them.  The stories, students&#39; comments and Doc&#39;s responses are reasons to consider the anatomy of our attitudes." />
