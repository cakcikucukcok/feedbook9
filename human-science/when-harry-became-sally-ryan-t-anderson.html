  <title>When Harry Became Sally - Ryan T. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Why publish a book about transgenderism?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The transgender “rights” movement is moving at breakneck speed. Never in human history has such a profound social and cultural change taken place in such a short period. In the space of one year, transgender issues went from something that most Americans had never heard of to a matter of basic human rights.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you think I exaggerate, consider this sequence of events. In April 2015, Bruce Jenner stunned the world as he told Dianne Sawyer that he was preparing to become a woman, and three months later, he told bewildered Americans to “call me Caitlyn.” A couple months after that, several jurisdictions passed laws against intentionally using the “wrong” pronoun to refer to a “transperson,” to be enforced with fines of up to a quarter-million dollars. And then in May 2016, the Obama administration told schools across the country that a 1972 law against sex discrimination now required boys to be treated as girls and girls to be treated as boys if they so requested. As we head into the 2016 elections, the transgender ideology is now orthodoxy for one of our major political parties and an untouchable “third rail” for the other party.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the heart of this development are two core beliefs. The first belief is that our bodies don’t matter—they’re not “who we are”—a recrudescence of the ancient religious movement known as Gnosticism. The “real me” is some experiential id that occupies or possesses my body but has no bodily existence itself. Transgenderism therefore buttresses other progressive causes. If you can convince people that Bruce Jenner isn’t a man, then you can convince them that the unborn child isn’t really a person. If male and female are not objective realities, then it becomes preposterous to insist that marriage is the union of man and woman. Underlying all of these claims is a belief that the real self is something other than an incarnate, embodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The second core belief at the heart of transgenderism is that it is good for the unhampered ego to do whatever it most deeply or urgently desires, whatever the social consequences. Transgenderism is the culmination of our liberationist culture. It’s not just that the real self is disembodied; it should be unencumbered by any external standards. True respect for human persons—for dis-incarnate selves—requires giving them unlimited freedom “to define [their] own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,” as a majority of the Supreme Court once said. If you can convince Americans that it’s no big deal for a fifth-grade boy to become a fifth-grade girl, you can convince them that the most meaningful dimensions of life should be subject to purely personal choice, that objective moral standards limit and diminish us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Up to a point, anyway. It turns out that some concepts of existence are more equal than others. If “your truth” happens to line up with moral traditionalism, then coercing you is just. The internal contradiction of transgenderism is that anyone who thinks the body matters and that the individual should conform himself and his actions to the truth will be coerced into accepting a new ideology. Liberationism has no tolerance for traditionalism. This is what lies behind the fines for people who use the “wrong” pronouns and behind the federal mandate that health care plans cover sex-reassignment therapies and that medical professionals perform them. This is what lies behind the Obama administration’s policy of indoctrinating school children in a lie about human identity and sexuality. No dissent can be tolerated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
