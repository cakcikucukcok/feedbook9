  <title>The Sure Foundation of Jeshua - Letora Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sure Foundation of Jeshua Son of God, daughter of man, it must be understood that the term Son of God refers to the descendants of Adam that were created in the image and the likeness of God (Genesis 6:1-2).
Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the spiritual blessing passed down from Seth to Noah, a just man who walked with God. Noah begat three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from his one wife (Genesis 6:18, Genesis 7:7) all of the same parents.
Facts show how this son was of one African physical makeup. Noah and his wife did not give birth to three sons of three different races. They were all of African/Edenic descent. And it was only Noah, his three sons, and their wives that entered into the ark before the flood. Therefore, it can be logically concluded that the people inhabiting the earth after the flood were of African descent (Genesis 6:8-10).
The Sure Foundation of Jeshua intertwines history with practical teaching for todays reader, offering Godly wisdom to help everyone with a sincere heart for God to walk in His ways and live a happy, meaningful, Spirit-filled life." />
