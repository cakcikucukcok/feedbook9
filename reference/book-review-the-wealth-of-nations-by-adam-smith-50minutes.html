      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;It can be hard for busy professionals to find the time to read the latest books. Stay up to date in a fraction of the time with this concise guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most significant works in economics history, and is a foundational text of classical economics. Written at a time when the Industrial Revolution was changing the face of Western societies, the book seeks to explain why some countries are wealthier than others and how a fair, productive society can be created. In particular, Smith&#39;s advocacy of division of labour, free trade and free markets, with equilibrium guaranteed by the so-called &quot;invisible hand of the market&quot;, proved extremely influential in the UK and USA and shaped our modern economic system. The work is still widely studied today, and remains one of the most cited texts in the social sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book review and analysis is perfect for: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;oStudents of economic theory and the history of economics&lt;br&gt;oAnyone who wants to gain a greater understanding of classical economics&lt;br&gt;oAnyone who is curious about why some countries are wealthier than others&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;About 50MINUTES.COM | BOOK REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Book Review series from the 50Minutes collection is aimed at anyone who is looking to learn from experts in their field without spending hours reading endless pages of information.
