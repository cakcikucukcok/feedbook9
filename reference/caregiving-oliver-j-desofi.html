  <title>Caregiving - Oliver J. DeSofi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the authors personal experience as a caregiver, how he became one, everything he learned along the way and what a wonderful life two people can have together regardless of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author wants to share what he learned; information from doctors, insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, disability claims and a number of other important issues including positive thinking and a happy life. His real life experiences have been battle tested in the totality of caregiving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information he shares relates to all caregivers and many situations; from diseases, accidental disability and war wounded veterans. He further describes how one caregiver, over a period of 24 years, was able to maneuver across the battlefield, still survive and not succumb to battle fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone elses knowledge about something negative can make things more positive for youand that is an important part of what this book is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many books out there are a wonderful collection of data compiled from the internet and government sources and provide answers to many issues. This book covers the must do items which are based on his experiences that can be used as a reference guide and adapted to your individualized situation. Every patient is different and in order to earn the Caregiver of the year award, you must find what works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important issue is to realize that a severely disabled person needs to be treated with respect and dignity. Unfortunately, too many handicapped patients are disposed of like a useless piece of furniture or parked out of sight at some poorly run institution. What would you want to happen to you, should you ever be disabled as a result of an accident or disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REMEMBER  it can happen to anyone  anytime, including YOU!&lt;/p&gt;" />
