  <title>Coming Together - Winona Garmhausen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This book tells the story of how
it was that the authors ancestors, coming from a variety of countries and
creeds and at different times, met in the northwest corner of &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Ohio&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;
and how it was that finally this movement across time and space would bring two
people from widely differing backgrounds, her parents, together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Before northwest Ohio was
officially opened to settlement by non-Indians, the authors paternal ancestors
moved onto these lands, which in 1817 had been legally set aside as a
reservation in perpetuity for the Shawnee Indian Tribe. As time passed, these
settlers worked out satisfactory lives with their Indian neighbors and friends
until the &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Shawnee&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; were forcibly
removed to &lt;st1:State&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Kansas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; in 1832. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The authors maternal ancestors &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;emigrated&lt;/span&gt; into the same area in the 1840s. &lt;st1:place&gt;Northwest
 Ohio&lt;/st1:place&gt; would soon be populated by small towns and villages and
cleared landscapes dotted by tidy farms. Slowly and regrettably, memories of
the &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Shawnee&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and other tribes who
had once inhabited this land faded as all thoughts were focused on the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Maps and photos and a
comprehensive Pedigree Chart, which traces the Kunz/&lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Lause&lt;/span&gt;
ancestry from its earliest known date in &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
in 1640 to the marriage of Viola &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Lause&lt;/span&gt; and Frederick
Kunz in 1929, accompany the books narrative.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
