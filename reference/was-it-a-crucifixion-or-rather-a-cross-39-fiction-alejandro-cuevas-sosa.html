  <title>Was it a Crucifixion or rather a cross&#39; fiction? - Alejandro Cuevas-Sosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is not on religions, but about whom the religious figures and many more persons were and are. Patriarchs, prophets, Buddha, Jesus, Mary, Joseph and associates, Lamas and Mohammad apologize to their followers for the millenarian fake they have been promoting. All the religious figures promote themselves through parasiting of dreams inducing in/appropriated scenes and images in the dreamer conforming to their convenience. Without this resource, they had been unable to publicise themselves. Doubts like these raised in the II Vatican Council perhaps propitiated John XXIII death.
