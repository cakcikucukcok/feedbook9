  <title>The Abandoned Children - Michael Shoels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a young girl who was orphaned at a young age. She was an only child with two loving parents who loved her unconditionally. Her parents were killed in a car accident and instead of her accepting it as an accidental death, she took it as though they abandoned her.
Even though she was left in the care of the aunt, her mothers sister; her husband; and their two children who were an upscale family, she chose to go the other way by hanging out with the wrong people and doing drugs. That went on until she got pregnant by her childhood boyfriend, and they were married at a young age.
After three children together, he was still her stability, until one Sunday, he went to the grocery store and walked in on a robbery and was shot and killed. That sent her over the edge, giving the same sense that she had with her parents that he had abandoned her and the children.
That lead her back to the streets and doing drugs until it took her life temporally after having an out-of-body experience with the afterlife. Once she understood the importance of family, she was given a second chance to live with the support of her family." />
