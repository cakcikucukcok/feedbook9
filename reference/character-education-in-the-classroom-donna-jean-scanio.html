  <title>Character Education in the Classroom - Donna Jean Scanio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Is your character showing? It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. What that means is that a picture can be remembered 10 years later whereas the exact words can be lost along the way. What does that tell you about the way you act and behave? How do you look to others?&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;I developed this program to help students learn skills necessary in building character. This material is designed to be an 8-10 week course that can be taught in schools. I have included various character traits along with worksheets for students to use to help them practice these skills necessary to develop character. You will see a variety of examples as well as appropriate and inappropriate behaviors. I have also included assessments to help evaluate student success in learning.&lt;/P&gt;

Teachers should use this material as a guide to fit their individual teaching style&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
