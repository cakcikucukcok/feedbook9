  <title>Post Internet - Gene McHugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Post Internet is a blog developed between December 2009 and September 2010 by the New York based art critic Gene McHugh, thanks to a grant of the Creative Capital | Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant Program.  For almost a year, Gene McHugh kept filling this folder with his personal notes. Writing and posting became a daily, regular activity, that sometimes produced many posts a day, sometimes long (or very long) texts posted at a slower pace. However, Post Internet is not just a piece of beautiful criticism, as reading this book proves. It&#39;s also, in itself, a piece of Post Internet art in the shape of an art criticism blog. GENE MCHUGH is an art writer and curator based in Brooklyn. His writing has appeared in Artforum and Rhizome. McHugh is currently the Kress Fellow in Interpretive Technology at the Whitney Museum of American Art." />
