      <meta name="description" content="To lead Airworthiness is to live dangerously. It&#39;s romantic and exciting to think of Airworthiness leadership as all inspiration, decisive action, and rich rewards, but leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disturbing the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there&#39;s a strong temptation to play it safe. Those who choose to lead plunge in, take the risks, and sometimes get burned. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way says Gerald Brady in &#39;The Airworthiness Handbook&#39;, providing the resources to make a difference without getting &#39;taken out&#39; or pushed aside. Presenting everyday tools that give equal weight to the dangerous work of leading Airworthiness change and the critical importance of personal survival. Through vivid best practices, Gerald Brady presents straightforward strategies for navigating the perilous straits of Airworthiness leadership. Whether starter or experienced, CEO or practitioner, this practical book gives you the tools to exercise Airworthiness leadership and survive and thrive to enjoy the fruits of your labor.&lt;BR&gt; PLUS, INCLUDED with your purchase, are real-life document resources; this kit is available for instant download, giving you the tools to navigate and deliver on any Airworthiness goal." />
