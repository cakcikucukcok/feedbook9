  <title>Research for Writers - David Meade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Business owners and writers face a common set of problems &amp;acirc;?? how to research, find and investigate topics that can be written about.  The Web is a multi-dimensionary repository but it can require specialized tools to locate and develop this information.  Public records, vital records, research portals, Freedom of Information documents, guides to investigative work and Internet resources for writers and journalists are scattered in a lot of locations &amp;acirc;?? in fact I have found 157 specific ones!  I&amp;acirc;??ve written a unique compendium which discusses each site by topic name, description and hyperlink.  One reference tool alone can make the difference in success or failure in developing a book, an article or a web page.  This is a Writer&amp;acirc;??s Intelligence Guide to Internet Resources.  It is equally useful for journalists, reporters, copywriters and business owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Search engines are acquainted primarily with words.  When creating a website, the normal procedure is to search for the best designer and then get a professional website with captivating colors and graphics, but watch out!  Do most websites optimize website content?  Obviously not, and this is the reason why many businesses fail to reach thousands of their customers.  SEO copywriting helps your website rank high on search engines.  You can phenomenally improve your web copy to achieve search engine optimization and one of the reasons I wrote this guide is that not only is it my specialty but I wanted to provide a resource for the community at large &amp;acirc;?? a tool that can be downloaded to one&amp;acirc;??s desktop or laptop and be an invaluable assistant to creating and optimizing web content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brainstorming a book or a web page is the first step in the writing process.
