  <title>The Geography of Central America and Mexico - Thomas A. Rumney</title>

An area of fascination and study for geographers and other scholars from around the world, these lands and peoples have played important roles in the discoveries and distributions of civilizations, resources, and nations for millennia. These regions have stimulated a large mass of research and publications across the many sub-disciplines of geography. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Geography of Central America and Mexico: A Scholarly Guide and Bibliography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; by Thomas A.

Each section is then further divided into by document type: atlases, books, book chapters, articles from scholarly journals, master&amp;rsquo;s theses, and doctoral dissertations. Although the majority of entries recorded focus on English-language works, selected entries written in Spanish, as well as French, German, and other languages are also included (with these entries&amp;rsquo; titles then translated into English and noted accordingly).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
