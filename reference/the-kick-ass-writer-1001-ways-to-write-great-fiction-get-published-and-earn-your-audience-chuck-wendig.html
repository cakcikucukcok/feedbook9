No task is too large or small for the kick-ass writer. With his trademark acerbic wit and gut-punch humor, Wendig will explain:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to build suspense, craft characters, and defeat writer&#39;s block.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to write a scene, an ending--even a sentence.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blogging techniques, social media skills, and crowdfunding.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How to write a query letter, talk to agents, and deal with failure--and success!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Whether you&#39;re just starting out or you need one more push to get you over the top, two things are certain--a kick-ass writer never quits, and Chuck Wendig won&#39;t let you down in this high-octane guide to becoming the writer you were born to be!&lt;/p&gt;" />
