Instead, it sees you as the resident expert on your life and keeps you firmly in the drivers seat. &lt;br /&gt;The 5 tools are simple skills and concepts, such as seeing other viewpoints. You are actively encouraged to decide when, where, and how to apply each tool as you see fit, using some or all of them to navigate and control your own unique journey. These tools are powerful, instantly applicable and timeless.&lt;br /&gt;By deliberately focusing on the future and creating what you want to experience, the book offers strategies rather than solutions. Its not about how to but rather how do you want to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;For over twenty-five years, Ian has worked with people from all walks of life and brings a wealth of practical and managerial experience to his writing.
