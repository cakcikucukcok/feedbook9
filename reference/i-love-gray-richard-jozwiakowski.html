&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt&quot;&gt;This book is an excellent how-to book for managers hired to implement change in their organization. It provides numerous examples that demonstrate that you dont need to be a CEO to implement change, yet provides steps, which if adhered to, can lead to becoming one. What differentiates this book from others on Change Management is that it is not just theory; the concepts have been tried and proven in practice. Analogies have been made to help clarify points made, and examples of other managers who have benefited from being tutored on these concepts are provided. It is a people oriented book because people make the difference.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;If things are changing and you are not, you are doing something wrong.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
