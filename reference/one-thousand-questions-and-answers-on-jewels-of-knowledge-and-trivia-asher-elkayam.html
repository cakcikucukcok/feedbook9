  <title>One Thousand Questions and Answers on Jewels of Knowledge and Trivia - Asher Elkayam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The following are questions on important subjects intended to help people use their memory in order to retrieve information on subjects they know such as History, Geography, Religion, Science and more trivia and curiosity questions will also be included.
This project will be divided into ten chapters with 100 questions for each chapter. The questions represent the first part of the book. The second part of the book includes the answers.
Unlike in the Jeopardy Show, which is designed for a new champions, this project is for everyone.
No one is required to gamble or play for money. No one is required to pull hair in order to find answers which may not always be so important or indispensible for everyone in real life.
It is intended to entertain and to enrich knowledge.
Some questions may pertain to one or more subjects or chapters. For example, questions on the Patriarch Abraham, could be found in the chapter on ancient history as well as in the chapter on the Bible. Questions on quotes may pertain to ancient history and scriptures as well as in contemporary writers/scientists.
The questions and statements given here are of public domain and are not questions or statements uniquely or specifically made by any educational institution. However, credit is given when due.
The answers will be given at the end of the book, so people can use their memory and knowledge before they look for the answer.
The author has consulted and researched dozens of books and hundreds of internet sources as written in his bibliography. Some of the answers may be found in books he had previously published, namely The Bible, The Power of the Word (and in between the lines); The Quran and Biblical Origins; One Family, Four Cultures and Four Continents; Whose God is it Anyway?; Love and Romance in the Bible.
Those books can be viewed at the following sites: www.amazon.com, www.asherauthor.com, www.xlibris.com and www.lulu.com (click on authors name)
The purpose of this work is to have people enjoy daily a few moments of fun. The contents are not in any chronological order.
This is not a fiction or drama book that needs to be finished at the end of the day. This will not only be fun to test ones knowledge, but also an excellent tool to sharpen and refresh the mind on different fields of knowledge.
In sum, is it important to state that rediscovering old and new facts and data can lead to a certain happiness and personal satisfaction.
Knowledge on diverse subjects can help in achieving better self-confidence and self-expression and, overall, a better quality of life for all people.
This project has something for everyone. The questions and answers will undoubtedly satisfy readers of all walks of life and of most age groups. Facts, data and world events become so complex that this project.
Finally, this project has been inspired by personal experience as it is explained at the end of this book under the title References and Bibliography." />
