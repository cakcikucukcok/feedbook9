  <title>Words of Love - Terrence Morrissey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WORDS OF LOVE
Some may be skeptical that poets could still be writing love poems. After all, for centuries romantics have been expressing their thoughts in verse and rhyme and surely we should have run out of couplets and soliloquies by now. However, the Greeks have five words for love that when coupled with the endless combinations and types of lovers, provides the poet with endless possibilities.They are all displayed here in one form or another, each one making its own fragile attempt at explaining that elusive feeling, love.

THE OBEDIENCE FACTOR
&quot;WOW&quot; is what came to mind the moment I read the first page of &quot;The Obedience Factor&quot; section. This compelling story grabs you from the beginning and helps you understand what real lonliness and rejection feels like. When you finish this section of &quot;WORDS OF LOVE&quot; you will realize nothing is impossible with God.
