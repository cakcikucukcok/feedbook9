  <title>A Solar Buyer&#39;s Guide for the Home and Office: Navigating the Maze of Solar Options, Incentives, and Installers - Stephen Hren, Rebekah Hren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Solar power, once a fringe effort limited to DIY enthusiasts, is now fast becoming mainstream. Many home and business owners are curious about solar electric and solar thermal systems, and wonder how to go about getting a clean energy generation system of their own. The vast majority will hire a professional installer to do the job. But what should they be asking of these installers? What system makes the most sense for their home or office: solar electric, solar hot water, solar heating, or some combination of these?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Solar Buyer&#39;s Guide for the Home and Office&lt;/em&gt; explains the options so that property owners can make the right choices both for their energy needs and their financial security. Understanding how solar power systems work will enable readers to be informed customers when dealing with professional installers-the book also provides advice on how to select a qualified installer and understand the expanding variety of tax credits and other incentives that are popping up around the country.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The market for solar systems has been growing at an exponential rate and strong tax credits ensure continued growth even in a sluggish economy. Many of those who would like to catch this undeniable wave of the future are held back by widespread confusion. &lt;em&gt;A Solar Buyer&#39;s Guide for the Home and Office&lt;/em&gt; clears the air, allowing property owners to move forward with confidence to make their homes and offices more comfortable, environmentally sound, and secure against wild swings in energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;" />
