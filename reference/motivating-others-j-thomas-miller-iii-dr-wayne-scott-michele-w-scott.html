  <title>Motivating Others - J. Thomas Miller Iii, Dr. Wayne Scott, Michele W. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The purpose of this book is to assist supervisors in becoming great motivators of todays worker.  Perhaps no job in business and industry is more important than that of the supervisor-motivator.  This person is a buffer, mediator, communicator, and jack-of-all-trades as well as motivator of others.  The successful supervisor must master all of these skills.  Too often he or she is the &quot;giver&quot; of positive reinforcement and rarely the &quot;receiver.&quot;  The supervisor is primarily accountable for organizational success or failure when it comes to motivational-productivity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This book will give the supervisor 12 action tools, or &quot;12 keys&quot; to better perform the most important role of supervision . . . motivating workers.  The supervisor will discover how to use innate abilities to achieve supervisory success in anything his or her heart desires, learn how to motivate 90% of the workers 100% of the time, and most specifically, learn how to lead without intimidation and be respected at the same time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This book was written especially for managers, supervisors, executives, and professionals who want to maximize their impact on others.&lt;/P&gt;
