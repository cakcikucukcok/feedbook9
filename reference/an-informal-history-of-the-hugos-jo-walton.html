  <title>An Informal History of the Hugos - Jo Walton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engaged, passionate, and consistently entertaining, &lt;i&gt;An Informal History of the Hugos&lt;/i&gt; is a book about the renowned science fiction award for the many who enjoyed Jo Walton&#39;s previous collection of writing from &lt;i&gt;Tor.com&lt;/i&gt;, the Locus Award-winning &lt;i&gt;What Makes This Book So Great&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hugo Awards, named after pioneer science-fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback, and voted on by members of the World Science Fiction Society, have been presented since 1953. They are widely considered the most prestigious awards in science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2013, Jo Walton wrote a series of posts for &lt;i&gt;Tor.com&lt;/i&gt;, surveying the Hugo finalists and winners from the award&#39;s inception up to the year 2000. Her contention was that each year&#39;s full set of finalists generally tells a meaningful story about the state of science fiction at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walton&#39;s cheerfully opinionated and vastly well-informed posts provoked valuable conversation among the field&#39;s historians. Now these posts, lightly revised, have been gathered into this book, along with a small selection of the comments posted by SF luminaries such as Rich Horton, Gardner Dozois, and David G. Hartwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A remarkable guided tour through the field--a kind of nonfiction companion to &lt;i&gt;Among Others&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s very good.
