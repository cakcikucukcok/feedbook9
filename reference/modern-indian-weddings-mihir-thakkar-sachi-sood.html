  <title>Modern Indian Weddings - Mihir Thakkar, Sachi Sood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you ready and excited to start designing your wedding?&lt;p&gt; 
Keep this in mind: the most important thing is to enjoy this wonderful process. This is an exciting beginning of a wonderful life. Your wedding week is a celebration, so let&#39;s make planning it a celebration as well by incorporating the things you cherish the most. Let&#39;s make your big day uniquely yours so it leaves behind cherished memories.&lt;p&gt;
As you begin planning, take it easy and go chapter by chapter. Start formulating your own ideas of what your wedding will be. The key is never to become overwhelmed. We love the idea of having an inspiration board to keep track of your wedding ideas so you can share them with your decorator, florist, or planner.&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, give yourself some time off occasionally from planning. That will help you be relaxed and refreshed and see things with a clearer view. Trust your vendors to handle the details. You&#39;ll be married and riding into the sunset before you know it.&lt;p&gt; 
In the meantime, you have some planning to do. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;" />
