  <title>My Mom Was Murdered - Pamala Messinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One day I was a happy mother of three with a great husband, wonderful job, and looking toward the future.  The next, I was a devastated zombie who was hardly able to talk in complete sentences. My mother had been murdered.  As a counselor and writer, I began to journal to try to help myself.  After several years, these were packed away, but never forgotten.  As the years went by, I often found myself counseling others who were going through the same type of grief.  I pulled out my journals to see if there was anything in my writing that might possibly help others.  It was then I realized I could put my words in a book and write about the techniques I learned to get me through each of my stages of grief.  My Mother Was Murdered: A Survival Story was born. It is my hope that my words can somehow help other wounded souls through their own personal journey. My heart holds a lot of love and I am sending it out to all of you, my fellow survivors. 
God Bless, Pamala" />
