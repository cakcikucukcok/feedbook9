  <title>A Giggly Gaggle of Friends - Jolian A. Gibbons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Giggle Gaggle of Friends is about children from all around the world. In todays society, not all children are aware that diversity is the norm. However for a brighter future, children need to know that it is acceptable to look different. Friendship is about the heart and personality of a person, not their outward appearance. In this book, children will see that it is not gender, skin color, or other factors that determines friendship. These things may seem trivial to adults, but for young growing minds these are important concepts that affect development. This book is geared towards children ages 2 to 6 when 
they start attending school, and begin developing friendships. The purpose of this book is to encourage 
children to cultivate friendships with others from different nationalities. It also doubles as an activity book to allow children to add in pictures of their own friends. Children need to embrace cultural differences in order to give them a balanced view of the world. Simply put, diversity is the key." />
