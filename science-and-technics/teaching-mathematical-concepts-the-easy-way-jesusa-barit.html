  <title>Teaching Mathematical Concepts, the Easy Way - Jesusa Barit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a good resource in Mathematics for teachers in teaching concepts such as Place Value, Elapsed Time, Estimating or Rounding , Numerical Patterns and Fact Families.  This book can be helpful to teachers in providing their students a structure in learning the different concepts through the use of a step by step process.  This book also used some mnemonic devices such as lines and arrows in helping students determine next steps. The use of the arrows and lines is a very important feature of every lesson especially fitted for slow learners.  Furthermore, this book can be used by teachers as a guide for direct instructions which can lead students to achieve mastery of these concepts.  In using this book, it is suggested that teachers can let the students use white boards or scratch papers in applying and practicing the step by step process.  It is further suggested that teachers use direct instructions for three or more occasions if mastery is to be achieved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Cognizant to all of these, worksheets which are reproducible have been provided for.  The step by step process can be seen in the answer keys of these worksheets.  These strategies in the book were used by the author in teaching slow learners, even special students for eight years and were found very effective and beneficial.  Sharing it to other teachers has been her desire and she is hopeful the she can help them lighten their load.  These strategies are simple but can result to higher test results as the students will be able to master the skill of computing and solving on scratch papers before answering a multiple- choice question and apply elimination.  The author hopes that teachers may enjoy teaching students under their charge  through this book and also hopes that students may also enjoy learning." />
