The model shows that we are all connected and created in a logical and orderly relationship with one another to give us more happiness and less pain, which suggests a loving creation process. At the spiritual level, Flint uses the model to define the soul and to discuss prayer and afterlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He defines Wisdom as a rich resource in the hidden reality. It can be used to cause deep healing of many issues. Examples of the communication between the therapist and patient teaches the reader a way to treat intruding souls, ancestral fields, and to use. Wisdom to treat common issues. Other experimental interventions are given. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healing Your Mind and Soul is an invaluable self-help guide that breaks important new therapeutic ground for both the health professional and the layperson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Garry A. Flint is a psychologist with over 40 years of clinical experience. He has treated issues in the quantum fields for the last 15 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is the author of three previous books, Emotional Freedom, A Theory and Treatment of Your Personality, and A Healing Legend, co-authored with Jo C. Willems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#39;a brave and provocative book&amp;#39;&lt;br&gt;Lee Pulos, Ph.D., A.B.P.P." />
