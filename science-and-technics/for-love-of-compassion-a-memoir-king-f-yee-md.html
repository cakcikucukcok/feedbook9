  <title>For Love of Compassion: A Memoir - King F. Yee, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by a news article about a missionary who spent his life serving on medical missions in Thailand, author Dr. King F. Yee changed his major from science to medicine.   This memoir follows Yee&#39;s long and vigorous educational process of medical school, internship, and residency. It shares how, following training, Yee realized obtaining credentials and hanging a shingle do not make a medical practice an instant success. In For Love of Compassion, he depicts the realities of private practice and the struggles he faced. He also shares the details of realizing his long-held dream of working on medical missions to the Philippines, with each place differing in need and challenges.   Yee&#39;s story exemplifies the lives of all who&#39;ve pursued the art of medicine. Compassion is the heart of medicine-compassion to care, compassion to heal, and compassion to freely give one&#39;s time and energy." />
