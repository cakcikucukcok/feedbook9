  <title>From the Big Bang to the Big Crunch and Everything in Between - Vlad Van Rosenthal,</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In our passionate curiosity to unravel the mysteries of the world, life, and the universe, humans have contrived numerous theories, both scientific and religious, with each claiming more relevance than the last. Despite all of these influential postulates, however, the real truth remains obscured to us, as it likely will until the moment of our eventual extinction. In &lt;i&gt;From the Big Bang to the Big Crunch and Everything in Between: A Simplified Look at a Not-So-Simple Universe,&lt;/i&gt; Dr. Vlad Van Rosenthal explores the subjects made complex by science and religionthose concerning our planet, our solar system, and our civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
Van Rosenthals compelling and accessible style introduces us to the fundamental explanations of the origin and future of our universe and of human life. From the cataclysmic explosion at the beginning to the one at the endeither from asteroids colliding with the earth, the nuclear explosion of nearby stars, or the fatal swelling of our own sunwe are a unique species on an unique planet that has most likely seen numerous civilizations and will hopefully see many more. We are all invited to form and debate our own perspectives on the earth, time, and space, for we are truly beholden to no ones mind but our own." />
