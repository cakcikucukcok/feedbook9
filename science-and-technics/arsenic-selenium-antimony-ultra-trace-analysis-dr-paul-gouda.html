      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul H. Ramses Gouda, is  a globally renowned chemist  who authored several science  books and papers. He has been  credited with the foundation of  several analytical laboratory  procedures utilizing Atomic Absorption and Inductively Coupled Plasma for ultra trace  analysis of As, Se, Sb &amp;Hg. These Methods were officially  adopted by EPL and by other  agencies, and  as routinely  practiced in the scientific arena   they were named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, who first attended  medical school before  specializing in analytical  chemistry, has acquired two  science doctorates. His contributions to the scientific  community include several papers  in pharmaceutical and medicinal  research, including a recent  invention of new pharmaceutical  compounds based on the unique  concept of the chemical  manipulation of hormonal and  neurological compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
