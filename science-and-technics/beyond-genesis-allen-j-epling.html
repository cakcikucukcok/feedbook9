  <title>Beyond Genesis - Allen J Epling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The origin of modern man and evolution are still subjects of debate between the fundamentalist right of the Christians and the academic community. It is a controversy that pervades our schools still today. This book examines an alternative explanation that allows for both groups to be right, and at the same time offers evidence and an explanation for many of the mysteries of the book of Genesis.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Anthropologists and historians universally agree that something extraordinary happened between 2500 BC and 2000 BC that lifted man from the stone age to civilization. All that we have today is because of that event. This includes our systems of government, our written language, our way of building cities, and even our religions. Was that &amp;ldquo;technology explosion&amp;rdquo; somehow related to the one we see today? Is there a connection between the book of Genesis in the Bible and this event? With the current controversy between &amp;ldquo;Creationism&amp;rdquo; and Evolution, could it be that both groups are right.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; My book gives a reasonable explanation that ties all the &amp;ldquo;mysteries&amp;rdquo; of Genesis into one very interesting story line.&amp;nbsp;Some of the questions answered in my book include, What is the Garden of Eden all about?, Where is it?, What was the flood of Noah?, and does our DNA contain hidden clues to support these stories?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Throughout the book, my basic hypothesis is that the Garden of Eden was real. I refer to recent evidence in a book by William Ryan and Walter Pitmen, Noah&amp;rsquo;s Flood, that confirms that the biblical worldwide flood was actually a local catastrophic event that really happened. I also show in my book that all other &amp;ldquo;myths&amp;rdquo; in the book are misinterpretations of just a few words in the original Hebrew Bible, and are true.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; These hypotheses are fully supported with accepted and known scientific research and are referenced to reliable data and sources. Finally, I challenge the reader to consider where this &amp;ldquo;plan&amp;rdquo; is taking us&lt;/p&gt;" />
