  <title>The Lost Inca Gold Chain of Machu Picchu - Gary F. Swagart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Lost Gold Chain of Machu Picchu&lt;/i&gt;, Gary Swagart provides a logical explanation for the establishment of Machu Picchu, its abandonment after being occupied for several centuries, the manner in which the rocks could have been fitted into the walls of Machu Picchu and Cuzco as they were, and the way the large rocks were moved and placed by the Incas and Pre-Incas. He provides a very logical reason why no gold was found at Machu Picchu when it was excavated. He provides a very logical reason for the existence of the Nazca Lines. Mr. Swagart provides a very logical description of the rise of the Inca Civilization, why it banners displayed a rainbow, and why it functioned so well. He provides a very logical explanation of the canals on the plain about Lake Titicaca and the demise of the agricultural system that had existed there. He provides a logical reason for the existence of sweet potatoes and other Peruvian plants on remote Pacific islands, the great stone statues on Easter Island, and the physical resemblance of many residents of South Pacific islands to Incas. He explains the creation and subsequent loss of the fabulous three-ton gold chain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
