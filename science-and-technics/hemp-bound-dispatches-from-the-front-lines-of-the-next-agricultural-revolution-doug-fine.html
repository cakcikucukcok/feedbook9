  <title>Hemp Bound: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Next Agricultural Revolution - Doug Fine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The stat sheet on hemp sounds almost too good to be true: its fibers are among the planet&#39;s strongest, its seed oil the most nutritious, and its potential as an energy source vast and untapped. Its one downside? For nearly a century, it&#39;s been illegal to grow industrial cannabis in the United States-even though Betsy Ross wove the nation&#39;s first flag out of hemp fabric, Thomas Jefferson composed the Declaration of Independence on it, and colonists could pay their taxes with it. But as the prohibition on hemp&#39;s psychoactive cousin winds down, one of humanity&#39;s longest-utilized plants is about to be reincorporated into the American economy. Get ready for the newest billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hemp Bound:Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Next Agricultural Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Doug Fine embarks on a humorous yet rigorous journey to meet the men and women who are testing, researching, and pioneering hemp&#39;s applications for the twenty-first century. From Denver, where Fine hitches a ride in a hemp-powered limo; to Asheville, North Carolina, where carbon-negative hempcrete-insulated houses are sparking a mini housing boom; to Manitoba where he raps his knuckles on the hood of a hemp tractor; and finally to the fields of east Colorado, where practical farmers are looking toward hemp to restore their agricultural economy-Fine learns how eminently possible it is for this misunderstood plant to help us end dependence on fossil fuels, heal farm soils damaged after a century of growing monocultures, and bring even more taxable revenue into the economy than its smokable relative.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fine&#39;s journey will not only leave you wondering why we ever stopped cultivating this miracle crop, it will fire you up to sow a field of it for yourself, for the nation&#39;s economy, and for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
