  <title>Young Minds Wasted: Reducing Poverty By Enhancing Intelligent Behavior - Thomas Schick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do the poor have in common besides poverty? They have largely untapped human potential; their capabilities, talents, and intelligence are hardly realized. Though none of us reach our potential intelligence, why do the advantaged get much closer than do the disadvantaged? Seeking answers to this question, this book reports many widely acknowledged interventions that raise intelligence, most substantially of the disadvantaged. Significantly, these interventions cost less than the nearly immediate societal benefits. With raised intelligence, capabilities increase and talents are revealed resulting in dramatically less poverty, more upward-mobility, and lower economic inequalities. Accordingly, many poor move into the middle-class and as the middle-class grows, more goods and services are required. More people are employed to satisfy the increasing demand for goods and services. The middle-class grows, poverty is further reduced, and the cycle develops its own momentum. All benefit." />
