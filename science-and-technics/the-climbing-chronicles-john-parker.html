  <title>The Climbing Chronicles - John Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Climbing Chronicles record the 1940s climbing exploits of Harry Parker. Born in Blackburn on 29 February 1916, Harry started climbing before the war and continued to do so after its conclusion, exploring the Peak District, Wales, the Lake District and Scotland. Each night he noted down his adventures in his &#39;chronicles&#39;, recording the routes he climbed, the walks, bicycle rides and journeys he undertook, and the people he met along the way. Harry&#39;s remarkable diaries have now been transcribed by his son John, and the resulting Chronicles offer a first-hand view of climbing and walking in Britain in the 1940s. With an enthusiasm for the outdoors and a sense of fun that springs from every entry, The Climbing Chronicles is an entertaining and fascinating - not to mention quirky - read." />
