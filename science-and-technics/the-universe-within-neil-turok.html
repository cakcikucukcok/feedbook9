  <title>The Universe Within - Neil Turok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the Lane Anderson Award, longlisted for the Charles Taylor Prize, shortlisted for the Libris Award for Non-Fiction and selected as an Amazon.ca Best Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With [&lt;em&gt;The Universe Within&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s] deeply thoughtful reflections on the place of science in society, on the need to educate the underserved, and on plenty of other topics rarely addressed in this sort of book, Turok takes you where no physicist has gone before. It&amp;#8217;s well worth making the journey with him.&quot; &amp;#8212;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most anticipated nonfiction book of the season, this year&#39;s Massey Lectures is a visionary look at the way the human mind can shape the future by world-renowned physicist Neil Turok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every technology we rely on today was created by the human mind, seeking to understand the universe around us. Scientific knowledge is our most precious possession, and our future will be shaped by the breakthroughs to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this personal, visionary, and fascinating work, Neil Turok, Director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, explores the transformative scientific discoveries of the past three centuries &amp;#8212; from classical mechanics, to the nature of light, to the bizarre world of the quantum, and the evolution of the cosmos. Each new discovery has, over time, yielded new technologies causing paradigm shifts in the organization of society. Now, he argues, we are on the cusp of another major transformation: the coming quantum revolution that will supplant our current, dissatisfying digital age. Facing this brave new world, Turok calls for creatively re-inventing the way advanced knowledge is developed and shared, and opening access to the vast, untapped pools of intellectual talent in the developing world. Scientific research, training, and outreach are vital to our future economy, as well as powerful forces for peaceful global progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elegantly written, deeply provocative, and highly inspirational, &lt;em&gt;The Universe Within&lt;/em&gt; is, above all, about the future &amp;#8212; of science, of society, of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
