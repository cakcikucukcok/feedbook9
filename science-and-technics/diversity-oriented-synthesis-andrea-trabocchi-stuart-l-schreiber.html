  <title>Diversity-Oriented Synthesis - Andrea Trabocchi, Stuart L. Schreiber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover an enhanced synthetic approach to developing and screening chemical compound libraries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diversity-oriented synthesis is a new paradigm for developing large collections of structurally diverse small molecules as probes to investigate biological pathways. This book presents the most effective methods in diversity-oriented synthesis for creating small molecule collections. It offers tested and proven strategies for developing diversity-oriented synthetic libraries and screening methods for identifying ligands. Lastly, it explores some promising new applications based on diversity-oriented synthesis that have the potential to dramatically advance studies in drug discovery and chemical biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Diversity-Oriented Synthesis&lt;/i&gt; begins with an introductory chapter that explores the basics, including a discussion of the relationship between diversity-oriented synthesis and classic combinatorial chemistry. Divided into four parts, the book:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Offers key chemical methods for the generation of small molecules using diversity-oriented principles, including peptidomimetics and macrocycles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expands on the concept of diversity-oriented synthesis by describing chemical libraries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Provides modern approaches to screening diversity-oriented synthetic libraries, including high-throughput and high-content screening, small molecule microarrays, and smart screening assays&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Presents the applications of diversity-oriented synthetic libraries and small molecules in drug discovery and chemical biology, reporting the results of key studies and forecasting the role of diversity-oriented synthesis in future biomedical research&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book has been written and edited by leading international experts in organic synthesis and its applications. Their contributions are based on a thorough review of the current literature as well as their own firsthand experience developing synthetic methods and applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly written and extensively referenced, &lt;i&gt;Diversity-Oriented Synthesis&lt;/i&gt; introduces novices to this highly promising field of research and serves as a springboard for experts to advance their own research studies and develop new applications.&lt;/p&gt;" />
