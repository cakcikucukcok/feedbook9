  <title>Experimental Organic and Medicinal Chemistry - T. Durai Ananda Kumar, N. Swathi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The modern medicinal chemistry utilizes several novel drug discovery tools to identify the drug-like molecules (lead) and to convert them into therapeutically potential molecules. The advanced and adequate practice in synthetic medicinal chemistry is essential for pharmacy graduates (B. Pharmacy and M. Pharmacy) to receive recognition in academia and industry sectors. This book titled Experimental Organic and Medicinal Chemistry-Principles &amp;amp; Practice consists of several topics covering both theory and practical concepts. The material spreads into synthetic and analytical approaches. The synthetic approach includes synthesis of drugs and drug intermediates and green synthetic strategy. The analytical approach deals with estimations of drugs, qualitative analysis of inorganic, organic and natural products, isolation and determination of active principles from natural sources. In addition, safety measurements, general laboratory practices, preparation of a few solutions and reagents are included as a ready reference. This book is a good companion for students of B. Pharmacy and a source book for M. Pharmacy (Pharmaceutical chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry) and other Pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry disciplines.&lt;br /&gt;
Salient features of this book are
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Systematic descriptions in simple language.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Neat and self explanatory chemical reaction mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The role of reagents, alternative reagents and hazards associated are highlighted.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pharmaceutical relevance of chemical reactions are described.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Limit tests, qualitative analysis of inorganic, natural and synthetic organic compounds are described in a lucid manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Estimations of natural and organic-medicinal compounds along with isolation of active principles are discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;T. Durai Ananda Kumar,&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;M Pharm., is working as a senior Assistant Professor, in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Gokaraju Rangaraju College of Pharmacy, Bachupally, Hyderabad. He has 9 years of teaching (Organic-Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacoinformatics) experience for under graduate and post graduate pharmacy students. His research activities focus on the design and synthesis of heterocycles, molecular modelling studies and generalization of synthetic and analytical chemical reactions using Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. He has guided research projects for M. Pharmacy (Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Analysis) students. He has 14 research publications in reputed national and international scientific journals. He is on editorial board of Research and Reviews: Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research and Reviews: Journal of Pharmacology. He has authored the book titled &amp;#39;Elementary Pharmacoinformatics&amp;#39;. He is a life member of Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India (APTI).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;N. Swathi,&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;M. Pharm., is working as Senior Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Gokaraju Rangaraju College of Pharmacy, Bachupally, Hyderabad. She has 10 years of teaching experience and taught Organic-Medicinal Chemistry subjects for B. Pharmacy and M. Pharmacy students. Synthesis and evaluation of nitrogen-based heterocycles and molecular modeling studies were few of her research interests. She has guided nine M. Pharmacy (Pharmacuetical Chemistry) students. She is a registered pharmacist in Andhra Pradesh State Pharmacy Council and a Life member of Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India. She has eight research publications in national and international scientific journals." />
