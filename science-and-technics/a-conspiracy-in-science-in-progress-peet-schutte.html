  <title>A Conspiracy in Science in Progress - Peet Schutte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A CONSPIRACY in SCIENCE in PROGRESS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are going to read about how science applies a system of mind control and thought processing. Every conspiracy that Science ever thought up such as the Critical Density Conspiracy or the Dark Energy Conspiracy, or any conspiracy connected to science is in place to protect this theory that those teaching science hides from anyone outside physics from becoming known. The Mother Conspiracy is in place so that students in physics are brainwashed by instigating the deliberate sanctioning of mind control on students through their practising of enforcing thought control they unleash on students. I prove that the Mother Conspiracy is in place. I reveal the Mother Conspiracy and I show why it is in place. I show how every student including you reading this has been brainwashed to believe science is true and to believe in science. I prove the Universe is formed as singularity and contains only singularity in many forms thereof.&lt;/p&gt;" />
