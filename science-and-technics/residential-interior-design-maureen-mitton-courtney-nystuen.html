  <title>Residential Interior Design - Maureen Mitton, Courtney Nystuen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A practical approach to planning residential spaces&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Residential Interior Design:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A Guide To Planning Spaces&lt;/i&gt; is the industry-standard reference for all aspects of residential space planning, with a practical focus on accessible design, ergonomics, and how building systems affect each space. This new third edition has been updated with the most recent code information, including the 2015 International Residential Code and the International Green Construction Code, and new content on remodeling. Packed with hundreds of drawings and photographs, this book illustrates a step-by-step approach to design that applies to any residential space, and ensures that the most important factors are weighted heavily in the decision making process. Daily use is a major consideration, and the authors explore the minimum amount of space each room requires to function appropriately while examining the host of additional factors that impact bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and more. Detailed information about accessibility is included in each chapter, making this book a reliable design reference for &quot;aging in place&quot; and universal design. The new companion website features teaching tools and a variety of learning supplements that help reinforce the material covered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interior design is a fundamental component of a residential space, and a required skill for architecture and design professionals. This book is a complete reference on all aspects of residential design, and the factors that make a space &quot;work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design spaces with primary consideration of daily use&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Account for building systems, accessibility, human factors, and more&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get up to date on the latest residential interior building codes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Plan interiors for any home, any style, and any budget&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designing a residential interior is about more than choosing paint colors and furniture—it&#39;s about people, and how they interact and use the space. It&#39;s about shaping the space to conform to its function in the best possible way. &lt;i&gt;Residential Interior Design&lt;/i&gt; provides clear, comprehensive guidance on getting it right every time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
