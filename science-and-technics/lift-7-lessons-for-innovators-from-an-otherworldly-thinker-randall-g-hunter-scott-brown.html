  <title>LIFT: 7 Lessons for Innovators From an Otherworldly Thinker - RANDALL G. HUNTER, Scott Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if I told you that recently declassified documents reveal that a secret space race took place around World War II, with many of the world&#39;s superpowers competing to create a flying saucer that could land and take off without need for a runway? What if I told you that the winner of this race was not a white-coated military scientist, but an artist with dirt beneath his nails who worked and lived on a remote, powerless homestead on California&#39;s Central Coast?   Alexander Weygers did not even own an overhead lamp, yet this classically trained sculptor knew something about innovation that others who were infinitely better resourced did not. How did he do it? How did a man living an &quot;Adam-and-Eve existence,&quot; as his wife put it, create the Discopter - an invention every bit as ambitious as the Wright Brothers&#39; flying machine?  At long last the secrets of Alexander Weygers are revealed in LIFT: Seven Lessons for Innovators from an Otherworldly Thinker.   &quot;Alexander Weygers (was) a modern Leonardo da Vinci.&quot; - San Francisco Chronicle  ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Like Alexander Weygers, Randall G. Hunter was a maker from a very early age, picking up woodworking, beekeeping, and toolmaking in his adolescence. He went on to become gallery director and director of sales for the Wyland Corporation. He then founded several successful online art galleries, including fineart360.com, mauiart.com, and fineart-e.com. He is the owner of Fine Art Estate, a publisher and retail gallery in Capitola, California, and Maui, Hawaii. He spent 10 years researching Weygers, as well as collecting his art and written work. He founded and is chair of the Weygers Foundation, which is based in Carmel Valley, California. A father of four and grandfather of one, he lives on California&#39;s Central Coast." />
