  <title>The Universe is Intelligent. The Soul Exists. Quantum Mysteries, Multiverse, Entanglement, Synchronicity. Beyond Materiality, for a Spiritual Vision of the Cosmos. - George Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pages 270. Illustrated.&lt;br /&gt;
The incredible discoveries of quantum physics are completely upsetting the assumptions of classical science. Today the technique allows amazing achievements. For example, the first quantum computers with almost unlimited computing capabilities are being realized. Some support the real possibility of time travel. In addition to these innovations known to the general public, there are others less known but no less important.&amp;nbsp; They are the novelties deriving from quantum studies, among which we can mention the &amp;quot;superposition of states&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;quantum collapse&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
The &amp;quot;superposition of states&amp;quot; confirms that the same particle can be found simultaneously in two or more places. The theory of &amp;quot;quantum collapse&amp;quot; confirms that the behavior of matter can be decided simply by observation. These are not assumptions, but principles verified experimentally.&lt;br /&gt;
This book does not only deal with these innovations, but gives much space to more advanced theories. These are theories announced but not yet confirmed. Furthermore, the book also evaluates the most risky theories, provided they are scientifically based.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, the book talks about the multiverse, or theory of parallel universes, proposed by the physicist Hugh Everett. In the same way the book speaks of non-locality. It is a psychic space totally independent of the laws of classical physics. As a result of non-locality, elementary particles, located at astronomical distances, behave as if they were one.&lt;br /&gt;
This book also talks about the latest research by Roger Penrose, an unbelieving physicist, and Stuart Hameroff. According to these two scientists the soul exists and can be identified with quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations have the ability to survive the physical death of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
If really the &amp;quot;souls&amp;quot; are condensations of quantum fluctuations, we can formulate a question: will it ever be possible to devise instruments that allow dialogue with these fluctuations?&lt;br /&gt;
The book exposes the research of established scientists but without using any mathematical formula. The theories are exposed in a simple and understandable way to everyone. In this way everyone can discover the unsuspected aspects of the reality in which we live.&lt;br /&gt;
It is clear that quantum physics is decreeing the end of materialism and the beginning of a new cultural phase, based on the collaboration between spirit and matter." />
