  <title>Pioneers of Microbiology and the Nobel Prize - ULF LAGERKVIST</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are swamped with information and each day seems to bring new discoveries that must be considered. Never before in the history of science have so many scientists been as active as today.
