  <title>The Little Book of Autorotations - Shawn Coyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first book devoted solely to the subject of landing a helicopter without engine power. It covers the basics, as seen from the cockpit of the helicopter, and is written from the pilot&#39;s perspective. It covers the subject for both the student helicopter pilot and the helicopter flight instructor. Training exercises are developed, starting from the very beginning through to how to adjust the flight path to arrive at a particular spot. The Height-Velocity curve and it&#39;s development are covered.  There are few formulae, and many diagrams. The text has been developed from the author&#39;s experience teaching autorotations at a major manufacturer&#39;s training school as well teaching student test pilots about the height-velocity diagram while instructing at three different test pilot schools. It is also based on his experience as an engineering test pilot at Transport Canada." />
