  <title>The Science of Stephen King: From Carrie to Cell, the Terrifying Truth Behind the Horror Masters Fiction - Lois H. Gresh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Advance Praise&lt;P&gt;&quot;What a treasure house is this book! Robots, space aliens, Einstein, black holes, time travel--these themes, and much more, from Stephen King&#39;s amazing books are opened up like toy chests. It&#39;s tremendous fun, entirely educational, and a great tribute to King.&quot;--Peter Straub&lt;P&gt;&quot;A fun, fun read.&quot;--F. Paul Wilson&lt;P&gt;&quot;The Science of Stephen King appeals to both the scientist and the longtimereader of Stephen King in me. Gresh and Weinberg use concepts from King&#39;s fiction as launching pads for in-depth explorations of concepts as diverse as ESP, pyrokinesis, time travel, artificial intelligence, quantum chemistry, alternate realities, string theory, and the possibility that we&#39;ll be visited by aliens or that we&#39;ll face a global pandemic. Much of what Stephen King writes about in his novels is closer to reality than you might think.&quot;--Bev Vincent, Ph.D., author of The Road to the Dark Tower&lt;P&gt;&quot;A superb overview of King&#39;s use of scientific concepts in his stories. And considering all the scary talk lately about pandemic flu, their chapter on The Stand is timely as hell.&quot;--Stephen Spignesi, author of The Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia&lt;P&gt;&quot;Just as Sagan and Asimov popularized science to the masses by making itentertaining and informative, so too do Gresh and Weinberg. Compulsively readable and thought-provoking.&quot;--George Beahm, author of The Stephen King Companion" />
