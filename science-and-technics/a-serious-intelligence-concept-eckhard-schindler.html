  <title>A Serious Intelligence Concept - Eckhard Schindler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book provides an essential description of a special four-dimensional intelligence concept. The advantage of this concept is that it also involves emotional and mental strengths, which are needed under difficult circumstances and in crisis situations, besides excellent cognitive abilities. It recognises the full scale of living conditions as a matter of intelligent efforts, or as challenges for the development of intelligence. This ranges, of course, from excellent intellectual performances in academic and economic environments, but also to distinctive capabilities to deal with great deprivations of all kinds, like poverty, discrimination, crime, political difficulties, or even greater or longer-lasting disasters or wars. The latter phenomena are not hothouses for people with a high IQ, or to develop excellent academic potentials, but they are also a matter of reasonable intentions, which require special elements of intelligence &amp;ndash; at least if the remaining three dimensions are taken into account, as contributed by this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The descriptions start with an analytical view of the brain, consciousness and the system of human needs, before the four-dimensional intelligence concept is developed on this basis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
