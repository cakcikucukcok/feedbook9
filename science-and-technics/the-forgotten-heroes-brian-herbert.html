  <title>The Forgotten Heroes - Brian Herbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States Merchant Marine has a tradition of being in the forefront of every American military action and has served with distinction in every conflict. &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Brian Herbert chronicles the amazing exploits of these gallant seamen, assembling a fascinating array of data from historical documents, government records, diaries, and interviews with surviving veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brilliant history details the heroism, self-sacrifice and grim determination that have always been the hallmark of the United States Merchant Marine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert also reveals one of the great injustices of American history. The civilian fighters of the Merchant Marine performed feats of extraordinary bravery during World War II; they were the lifeline of the entire Allied war effort, delivering troops, materiel, food, fuel, and every essential needed for victory over the Axis. In doing so, the Merchant Marine suffered losses so high that the casualty rates were kept secret. At war&#39;s end, the men and women of every other service branch were honored by parades and given medical and educational benefits--but the members of the Merchant Marine, who were so vital to our victory, have received neither the benefits nor the recognition they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert is part of a growing movement across the United States to right the wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Forgotten Heroes&lt;/i&gt; is a history of these unsung heroes and a plea for justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
