  <title>Offensive and Defensive Security - Harry I Nimon PhD Pmp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Numerous publications exist which examine elements of the security discipline. Few address these elements as a continuum of interrelated functions. None examine the structure of Offensive vice Defensive security in anything other than the domain of international security . This text has been written to fill this gap and to support a course in Offensive-Defensive Security, developed by Henley-Putnam University, which briefly reviews the history of the field of strategic security and its three component parts  protection, intelligence, and counterterrorism  as well as its two distinguishing characteristics: offensive tactics and operations combined with technological innovation. 
The course then moves to an in-depth assessment of related security areas that focus on defensive tactics and operations: homeland security, criminal justice, conflict and peace studies, and emergency management. While these fields may appear  at first  to be part of strategic security, this course and the associated text explores the critical differences and the fact that they are also critical elements of industrial, governmental, and military security. Emphasis will be placed at an introductory level  both academic and professional distinctions  and discuss the structures associated within these domains.
	The text is divided into the following key sections: 
Section 1: The Basics
Section 2: The Environment
Section 3: Security Planning and Management
	Section 1 provides an orientation for the reader to a common frame of reference through information provided in the following chapters. It is not intended to be a single source of all relevant information. Additionally, this text is not intended to be the exhaustive single source for all conditions. Rather, it provides a roadmap of considerations on how to reach a specific goal in an efficient and informed manner.
Section 2 examines the world the security professional must inhabit, again, in a generalized manner and, likely, in a way never before considered. Elements of neurology, biology, physics, philosophy, logic, analytics, and finance are presented in a manner unique to the changing paradigm of Offensive-Defensive Security philosophy. The various chapters are labeled as terrains as the best representation of the environmental information to be discussed. Each will approach the topics in as clear a manner possible of current thinking and science within each as critical to the understanding of the total security environment; the how, why, and in what ways they will affect the world of this security paradigm.
Finally, Section 3 incorporates the information of the first two sections and applies the knowledge gained to the planning and management of an integrated security plan. The objective of this section is to utilize the concepts and processes developed via international agencies such as the Project Management Institute to demonstrate how to create an integrated and manageable enterprise structure and not a one-size fits all template.
As the knowledge consolidates, integration begins, that of incorporating the security entity into the enterprise as a whole be that enterprise be a business, government entity, or military operation. The only difference is the scale. This is a vital step in that the act of protection cannot interfere with the process of performing the enterprise function. In fact, it must enhance the enterprise function and assist in ensuring its success.
Key Learning Points
	The approach and purpose of this text has been outlined. The following are the key reasons or learning points in summary.
a.	Define the key elements and environments within which the security plan and operational management activities must occur
b.	Familiarize the student with cultural, biological, financial, informational, and legal aspects necessary for the understanding of how these domains influence human behavior; the primary aspect of security planning and operations
