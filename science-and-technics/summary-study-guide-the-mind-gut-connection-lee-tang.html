  <title>Summary &amp; Study Guide - The Mind-Gut Connection - Lee Tang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;This simple lifestyle change can help you lose weight and decrease the risk of chronic illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This book is a summary of &amp;ldquo;The Mind-Gut Connection: How the Hidden Conversation Within Our Bodies Impacts Our Mood, Our Choices, and Our Overall Health,&amp;rdquo; by Emeran Mayer, MD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For many years, doctors looked at the human body as a complex machine with independent parts. Disease was a breakdown of a single organ or gene that can be fixed through medication or surgery. There was no need to understand its cause. This model has worked for certain acute diseases but failed in treating many chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;br /&gt;
Today, we realize that the complex regulatory mechanisms that keep us healthy do not operate independently. Our brain, our gut, and the gut microbes communicate with one another constantly to keep us healthy. When this communication channel is out of whack, major health problems can result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;The Mind-Gut Connection&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Emeran Mayer offers a cutting-edge view of the emerging science of gut-brain communication. He teaches us how, with a few changes to our diet and lifestyle, we can lose weight, develop a happier mindset, and reduce the risk of neurological diseases such as Parkinson&amp;#39;s and Alzheimer&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This book redefines what it means to be healthy and provides practical steps to achieve that goal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
