  <title>Life Lessons - Sharon Briggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book will pull the reader into the world, culture, and mentality of the author. It reaches into the mind of the reader to pull out the character flaws of many believers who may be sitting in judgment of those on the outskirts of the pure, the perfect, the rich, and those living in the mainstream of Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Lessons is a wonderful book.In this book you may have experienced some of these things or you may know someone else who has. Through it all, it always leads you to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Prepare yourself for an amazing journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha King,  Teacher and Editor, Word Newsletter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amazing writing collection. Inspiring, spiritual, truly a must read! This compilation encompasses some of her best pieces of work thus far. If you want to be captivated by thought-provoking reading, then this is the book for your soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Trese Newson,  Law Enforcement Officer, Artist, Philanthropist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharons writings are inclusive to all audiences. They transcend age and are appropriate for both children and adults. I have been familiar with this author for over sixteen years. I have watched her go through many challenges and come through them victoriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has continually gone through the fires of this life, thanking God for the trials. This is why she is who she is. &lt;/p&gt;
