  <title>Dimensions Within: Physics and the Structure of Consciousness - Samuel Avery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until recently we thought the world was made of space, time, and matter. We assumed consciousness was &amp;ldquo;inside&amp;rdquo; of ourselves, while the hard, cold, material world was &amp;ldquo;outside,&amp;rdquo; existing independently of life. Now, due to the discoveries of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, we are not so sure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Dimensions Within&lt;/em&gt;, a multimedia ebook, Samuel Avery shares the startling idea that thinking there is a world &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; may be the wrong way around. Instead, all things are within consciousness. Using a model he calls The Quantum Screen, he describes how the physical world may exist only to the extent that we perceive it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This interactive ebook opens a new world of exploration and dives into the details of Avery&amp;rsquo;s brilliant model of consciousness. Step-by-step, it details the relationship between dimensions and realms of consciousness &amp;mdash;that is, the relationship between space, time, and mass, and the five senses. Space and time may not be &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; after all.&amp;nbsp; Avery believes they are &amp;ldquo;in here.&amp;rdquo; Consciousness is not in space-time; space-time is in consciousness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This is no ordinary book. It contains written text, video and audio segments, as well as more than a dozen creatively animated videos to illustrate some of the enigmas of modern physics and to facilitate an understanding of the Quantum Screen model of consciousness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This multimedia ebook is about much more than physics! It&amp;rsquo;s about us&amp;mdash;about what we actually experience by being alive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Note: The audio and video content included in this ebook are essential in order to have a complete understanding of the material. In order to keep the file size of the ebook small, the audio and video content is included as links to online videos. You will need to be connected to the Internet to view the multimedia content.&lt;/p&gt;" />
