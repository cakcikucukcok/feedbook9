  <title>Debate Resolved - George Grebens PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This e-book has a life that began with 28 pages of recommendations to a high school teacher who requested ways of addressing a publishers three questions on the Neo-Evolution vs. Creation debate. This was in May 2005. Since then I expanded similar Q&amp;As in various media, participated in public debates (2007-2009).
				I look back to the successful high level Evolution vs. Creation debates that were held during the 1970s and early 1980s. Dr. Henry M. Morris and Dr. Duane T. Gish had used their newly developed Creation Scientific Model to challenge those who defended the Evolution Scientific Model. The Debates format was very constructive and contributed strategically in addressing many key issues that required further clarification.
				The debaters were well prepared and well-disciplined and even if some of the debaters appeared to have lost in this round, the debate exercise itself helped to rejuvenate the debaters and the audience thus helping them to energize and look forward towards the next round of the continuing series of debates" />
