  <title>The Theory of Material Mind - Philip Hodgetts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;&lt;p&gt;The theory is basically an analysis of the physical and metaphysical mechanisms involved in the generation of paranormal or, more scientifically expressed, parapsychological phenomena. It includes a logical and undeniable proof that there is truth in astrology as in all the divinatory arts to a greater or lesser degree. It also contains a proof of the existence of the soul or spirit and explains that the personal unconscious is motivated by a metaphysical intelligence, the generator of enthusiasm which I, along with the ancient Greeks, know as the god within, the mischievous root and origin of all parapsychological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory also explains that all life, past or present, is joined by or immersed in a subtle fluid which I call psychoplasma. This is the medium of telepathy and much, if not all, other paranormal phenomena. All life, past or present implies that there is an afterlife, which I have found to be true. Psychoplasma is a mixture or compound of conscious, metaphysical spirit and physical bioplasma that is secreted in the cells of all living matter and is the reason for the theorys title of material mind. My theory, which incorporates metaphysical entities, comes down strongly in support of intelligent design as a complement to natural selectionthe two of them work together, ID providing the motive force for change and NS the template for design. Atheism is rejected as no longer tenable, though the existence of a supreme being is denied, for as well as the metaphysical god within, it would appear that there are indeed mysteries probably responsible for the origin of the universe, which science will never explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is extremely subversive and strikes at the roots, though not invalidating, all of established science, including evolutionary theory and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
