  <title>Do You Know What Is Energy? - Koji Goto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Energy is an old and new theme for mankind. If we could get it freely, what would happen? For instance, gravity is a kind of energy which wont dry up forever. Then isnt it possible to utilize it for our life?
								On the other hand, there is anomalous natural power that we cannot control even by advanced technology. Hurricane, tornado, earthquake, eruption, tsunamiall these are caused by uncanny energy. Cant we dodge them by any means?
								Before finding the way to cope them, we have to know the true substance of the energy. I would like to ask what is the real entity of it. I think there must be some vault where the key to solve the secret is deposited. In this way, I have come up with a strongbox named mysterythe mystery of the traffic accidents in the air and the sea. It took many years for me to open the heavy doors of the strongbox. Im going to rummage the contents of it here. Therefore, this story is semi-documentary science fiction. I think the ninety percent of it is true. Then what part is the fiction? I would like to leave it to the readers judgment" />
