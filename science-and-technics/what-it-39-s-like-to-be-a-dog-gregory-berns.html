  <title>What It&#39;s Like to Be a Dog - Gregory Berns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Dog lovers and neuroscientists should both read this important book.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Dr. Temple Grandin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What is it like to be a dog? A bat? Or a dolphin? To find out, neuroscientist and bestselling author Gregory Berns and his team did something nobody had ever attempted: they trained dogs to go into an MRI scanner--completely awake--so they could figure out what they think and feel. And dogs were just the beginning. In &lt;i&gt;What It&#39;s Like to Be a Dog&lt;/i&gt;, Berns takes us into the minds of wild animals: sea lions who can learn to dance, dolphins who can see with sound, and even the now extinct Tasmanian tiger. Berns&#39;s latest scientific breakthroughs prove definitively that animals have feelings very much like we do--a revelation that forces us to reconsider how we think about and treat animals. Written with insight, empathy, and humor, &lt;i&gt;What It&#39;s Like to Be a Dog&lt;/i&gt; is the new manifesto for animal liberation of the twenty-first century.&lt;/div&gt;" />
