  <title>The Cosmic Constants - Mathew David Hendricks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our universe is a slow motion matter Factory. The matter that our universe continuously produces, is made from the matter that is continuously emitted into our universe, at the very center of our universe. This matter contains all of the internal information necessary to produce a larger version of its smaller self. As this matter travels from the center of our universe outward, it goes through a specific, continuously balancing amount of accumulation transformations. All of these accumulation transformations happen in a very specific, continuously balancing sequence. Our universe is the continuously balancing activity of this entire specific, continuously balancing sequence. All of the continuously balancing behaviors of our universe are Constant. All of the continuously balancing behaviors of our universe are happening Now. The matter that is passing through our universe is on a journey. All matter is on a journey. One specific journey. All of matter&#39;s behaviors are simply transformations of this one specific journey.
This is not a book of answers. This is a book of observations, based solely on the process of elimination." />
