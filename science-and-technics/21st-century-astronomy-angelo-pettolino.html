  <title>“21St Century Astronomy” - Angelo Pettolino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the introduction of indisputable proof by the scientific world confirming an expanding universe/solar system, many inconsistencies in the accretion theory, which are all now discredited, have come to light. Since their demise, astronomers have been feverishly trying to explain the formation of our solar system and water with theories like special relativity, general relativity, string, steady state, nebula hypothesis, and the gravity formation accretion theory all without success. This book, 21st Century Astronomy, completes the puzzle, answers every question, and ticks every box of doubtful questions with provable and logical explanations and experiments to prove the theorys point.
A reimagined theory to the now-disproved accretion theory is central to what is called twenty-first-century astronomyor the AP theory by  A. Pettolino. This bold truth book based on the latest, up-to-the-minute discoveries takes us one step closer to the logical truth and attempts to answer the unanswered questions and dispel previous misinformation and misconceptions. 
This cutting-edge, insightful new book offers a logical explanation for the formation of our solar system and water, which has been a mystery up until now. The AP theory also unlocks the riddle of how our solar system formed only 4.8 billion years ago. The theory chronologically describes the unbroken chain of events explaining how fusion and fission reactedwithin a one-hundred-thousand-cubic-mile area in our infant, partially frozen (Sun) cloudproduced and provided all the materials to form water and our entire solar system." />
