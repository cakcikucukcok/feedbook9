  <title>The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals - Robert H. Crabtree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provides vital information on organometallic compounds, their preparation, and use in synthesis, and explores the fundamentals of the field and its modern applications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fully updated and expanded to reflect recent advances, the new, seventh edition of this bestselling text presents students and professional chemists with a comprehensive introduction to the principles and general properties of organometallic compounds, as well as including practical information on reaction mechanisms and detailed descriptions of contemporary applications. Increased focus is given to organic synthesis applications, nanoparticle science, and green chemistry. This edition features up-to-date examples of fundamental reaction steps and greater emphasis on key topics like oxidation catalysis, CH functionalization, nanoclusters and nanoparticles, and green chemistry. New coverage is added for computational chemistry, energy production, and biochemical aspects of organometallic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals, Seventh Edition&lt;/i&gt; provides new/enhanced chapter coverage of ligand-assisted additions and eliminations; proton-coupled electron transfer; surface, supported, and cooperative catalysis; green, energy, and materials applications; and photoredox catalysis. It covers coordination chemistry; alkyls and hydrides; Pi-complexes; and oxidative addition and reductive elimination. The book also features sections on insertion and elimination; spectroscopy; metathesis polymerization and bond activation; and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Provides an excellent foundation of the fundamentals of organometallic chemistry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Includes end-of-chapter problems and their solutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expands and includes up-to-date examples of fundamental reaction steps and focuses on important topics such as oxidation catalysis, CH functionalization, nanoparticles, and green chemistry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Features all new coverage for computational chemistry, energy production, and biochemical aspects of organometallic chemistry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals, Seventh Edition&lt;/i&gt; is an insightful book that will appeal to all advanced undergraduate and graduate students in organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry, as well as any practicing chemist in those fields.&lt;/p&gt;" />
