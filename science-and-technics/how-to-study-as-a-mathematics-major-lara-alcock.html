  <title>How to Study as a Mathematics Major - Lara Alcock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every year, thousands of students in the USA declare mathematics as their major. Many are extremely intelligent and hardworking.  However, even the best will encounter challenges, because upper-level mathematics involves not only independent study and learning from lectures, but also a fundamental shift from calculation to proof. This shift is demanding but it need not be mysterious -- research has revealed many insights into the mathematical thinking required, and this book translates these into practical advice for a student audience. It covers every aspect of studying as a mathematics major, from tackling abstract intellectual challenges to interacting with professors and making good use of study time. Part 1 discusses the nature of upper-level mathematics, and explains how students can adapt and extend theirexisting skills in order to develop good understanding. Part 2 covers study skills as these relate to mathematics, and suggests practical approaches to learning effectively while enjoying undergraduate life.As the first mathematics-specific study guide, this friendly, practical text is essential reading for any mathematics major." />
