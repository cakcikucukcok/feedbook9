  <title>Repeated Measures Design for Empirical Researchers - J. P. Verma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduces the applications of repeated measures design processes with the popular IBM® SPSS® software&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Repeated Measures Design for Empirical Researchers &lt;/i&gt;presents comprehensive coverage of the formation of research questions and the analysis of repeated measures using IBM SPSS and also includes the solutions necessary for understanding situations where the designs can be used. In addition to explaining the computation involved in each design, the book presents a unique discussion on how to conceptualize research problems as well as identify appropriate repeated measures designs for research purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Featuring practical examples from a multitude of domains including psychology, the social sciences, management, and sports science, the book helps readers better understand the associated theories and methodologies of repeated measures design processes. The book covers various fundamental concepts involved in the design of experiments, basic statistical designs, computational details, differentiating independent and repeated measures designs, and testing assumptions. Along with an introduction to IBM SPSS software, &lt;i&gt;Repeated Measures Design for Empirical Researchers &lt;/i&gt;includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A discussion of the popular repeated measures designs frequently used by researchers, such as one-way repeated measures ANOVA, two-way repeated measures design, two-way mixed design, and mixed design with two-way MANOVA&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Coverage of sample size determination for the successful implementation of designing and analyzing a repeated measures study&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A step-by-step guide to analyzing the data obtained with real-world examples throughout to illustrate the underlying advantages and assumptions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A companion website with supplementary IBM SPSS data sets and programming solutions as well as additional case studies&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Repeated Measures Design for Empirical Researchers &lt;/i&gt;is a useful textbook for graduate- and PhD-level students majoring in biostatistics, the social sciences, psychology, medicine, management, sports, physical education, and health. The book is also an excellent reference for professionals interested in experimental designs and statistical sciences as well as statistical consultants and practitioners from other fields including biological, medical, agricultural, and horticultural sciences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J. P. Verma, PhD, &lt;/b&gt;is Professor of Statistics and Director of the Center for Advanced Studies at Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education, India. Professor Verma is an active researcher in sports modeling and data analysis and has conducted many workshops on research methodology, research designs, multivariate analysis, statistical modeling, and data analysis for students of management, physical education, social science, and economics. He is the author of &lt;i&gt;Statistics for Exercise Science and Health with Microsoft® Office Excel®&lt;/i&gt;, also published by Wiley.&lt;/p&gt;" />
