  <title>I/T Architecture in Action - Richard J. Reese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is for business professionals interested in learning techniques for managing change in technology driven companies.  It focuses on bridging business and I/T strategies through the Enterprise Architecture function.  Unlike many books about I/T, it is not about building things.  Rather, it is about what business people can do with what I/T produces.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience is that a balance between strict rigor and organic innovation works best.  The book you are about to read, I/T Architecture in Action, describes this balance.  The author, Richard J. Reese, has done a fine job of blending his own experience with industry trends and facts in a book that is not too technical, yet will appeal to technicians.  As he says, this is a management book about technology, not a technology book that touches on management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Offereins, EVP/CTO Discover Financial Services LLC.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An award winning leader in technology, Richard J. Reese is known for his ability to communicate technical topics to all levels of management.  With nearly 30 years in I/T, he has worked as a senior leader in I/T Architecture for some of the largest companies in the world.  Richard leads the Enterprise Architecture function at Discover Financial Services LLC (issuer of the Discover Card).  He served as Vice President, Enterprise Architecture for W.W. Grainger, Inc., and was an Applications Architect for United Airlines.  As an IBM employee, Richard achieved the designation of Certified I/T Architect in 1992 and was elected to serve on the I/T Architect Certification Board in 1993.  Richard received his MBA from Loyola University of Chicago and a Bachelors Degree in Quantitative Information Science from Western Illinois University.&lt;/p&gt;" />
