  <title>Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics - Shayle R. Searle, Andre I. Khuri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thoroughly updated guide to matrix algebra and it uses in statistical analysis and features SAS®, MATLAB®, and R throughout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This &lt;i&gt;Second Edition &lt;/i&gt;addresses matrix algebra that is useful in the statistical analysis of data as well as within statistics as a whole. The material is presented in an explanatory style rather than a formal theorem-proof format and is self-contained. Featuring numerous applied illustrations, numerical examples, and exercises, the book has been updated to include the use of SAS, MATLAB, and R for the execution of matrix computations. In addition, André I. Khuri, who has extensive research and teaching experience in the field, joins this new edition as co-author. The &lt;i&gt;Second Edition &lt;/i&gt;also:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contains new coverage on vector spaces and linear transformations and discusses computational aspects of matrices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Covers the analysis of balanced linear models using direct products of matrices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Analyzes multiresponse linear models where several responses can be of interest&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Includes extensive use of SAS, MATLAB, and R throughout&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contains over 400 examples and exercises to reinforce understanding along with select solutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Includes plentiful new illustrations depicting the importance of geometry as well as historical interludes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics, Second Edition &lt;/i&gt;is an ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate level courses in statistics and other related disciplines. The book is also appropriate as a reference for independent readers who use statistics and wish to improve their knowledge of matrix algebra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE LATE SHAYLE R. SEARLE, PHD, &lt;/b&gt;was professor emeritus of biometry at Cornell University. He was the author of &lt;i&gt;Linear Models for Unbalanced Data &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Linear Models &lt;/i&gt;and co-author of &lt;i&gt;Generalized, Linear, and Mixed Models, Second Edition, Matrix Algebra for Applied Economics, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Variance Components, &lt;/i&gt;all published by Wiley. Dr. Searle received the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award, and he was an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANDRÉ I. KHURI, PHD, &lt;/b&gt;is Professor Emeritus of Statistics at the University of Florida. He is the author of &lt;i&gt;Advanced Calculus with Applications in Statistics, Second Edition &lt;/i&gt;and co-author of &lt;i&gt;Statistical Tests for Mixed Linear Models, &lt;/i&gt;all published by Wiley.
