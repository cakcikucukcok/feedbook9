  <title>The Telomerase Revolution: The Enzyme That Holds the Key to Human Aging¿and Will Soon Lead to Longer, Healthier Lives - Michael Fossel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;One of &lt;I&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s &quot;Best Books for Science Lovers&quot; in 2015&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Science is on the cusp of a revolutionary breakthrough. We now understand more about aging&amp;#151;and how to prevent and reverse it&amp;#151;than ever before.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In recent years, our understanding of the nature of aging has grown exponentially, and dramatic life extension&amp;#151;even age reversal&amp;#151;has moved from science fiction to real possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dr. Michael Fossel has been in the forefront of aging research for decades and is the author of the definitive textbook on human aging. In &lt;I&gt;The Telomerase Revolution&lt;/I&gt;, he takes us on a detailed but highly accessible scientific journey, providing startling insights into the nature of human aging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Twenty years ago, there was still considerable debate of the nature of human aging, with a variety of competing theories in play. But scientific consensus is forming around the telomere theory of aging. The essence of this theory is that human aging is the result of cellular aging. Every time a cell reproduces, its telomeres (the tips of the chromosomes) shorten. With every shortening of the telomeres, the cell&amp;#8217;s ability to repair its molecules decreases. It ages. Human aging is the result of the aging of the body&amp;#8217;s trillions of cells.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But some of our cells don&amp;#8217;t age. Sex cells and stem cells can reproduce indefinitely, without aging, because they create telomerase. Telomerase re-lengthens the telomeres, keeping these cells young.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Telomerase Revolution&lt;/I&gt; describes how telomerase will soon be used as a powerful therapeutic tool, with the potential to dramatically extend life spans and even reverse human aging. Telomerase-based treatments are already available, and have shown early promise, but much more potent treatments will become available over the next decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Telomerase Revolution&lt;/I&gt; is the definitive work on the latest science on human aging, covering both the theory and the clinical implications. It takes the reader to the forefront of the upcoming revolution in human medicine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
