  <title>Basic Concepts of Nuclear Physics - Jagadish B. Garg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="book provides a clear and concise discussion of basic concepts of nuclear physics to be covered in a one semester course in nuclear physics offered in colleges and universities. This course can be taken by physics and nuclear engineering seniors and graduate students, who have taken one semester of quantum mechanics and a course in math. Methods  of physics. This book begins with the general properties of nuclei. In chapters 2 and 3 it discusses the nature of  nuclear force as learned from the properties of deuteron and from the two body interactions of (n, n ), (n, p) and (p, p) pairs. In chapter 4 it gives discussion of the nuclear structure in terms of different nuclear models such as shell, collective vibration and rotation, unified and liquid drop. The models are applicable in different mass regions of nuclei. In chapter 5, discussion is given about \,  and - ray modes of decay of unstable nuclei. Chapter 6 deals with different types of nuclear reactions induced by n, p, d, t, \- particles etc. These reactions are compound nucleus formation, direct reactions, such as stripping, knock out, pick up reactions, photonuclear reactions, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion etc. Chapter 7 gives a brief discussion of application of nuclear physics to other fields such as bio medical, nuclear energy, industry, crime detection and astrophysics. In chapter 8, I have given conceptual problems related to each chapter. The main feature  of this book is that it gives a coherent treatment of each topic of nuclear physics in the proper order.

&lt;b&gt;Book Review&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Basic concepts of nuclear physics written by Jagadish B. Garg, Physics Professor, State University at Albany is a timely book. To my knowledge no other text book on this subject had been published in recent years. This book is written in a clear, concise and orderly fashion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book begins with a discussion of the discovery of nucleus by Lord Rutherford and then describes all the basic properties of nuclei. In chapters 2and 3, the author discusses the nucleon  nucleon force determined by properties of deuterons and from interaction of pairs of nucleons. In chapter 4, he discusses nuclear structure as described by shell, collective rotation, vibration, unified and liquid drop models. In chapter 5, he discusses various nuclear modes such as alpha, beta and gamma  decay of unstable nuclei,  In chapter 6, he  discusses nuclear reactions induced by neutrons, protons, deuterons, He 3, He 4 and triton particles, photo nuclear reactions,  nuclear fission and fusion. Theoretical treatment of these topics is appropriate for an introductory survey course in nuclear physics. Chapter 7 gives a brief discussion of application of nuclear physics to nuclear energy, to medical field such as diagnostic and treatment of human diseases, application to astro-physics, crime detection and  determination of pollution in the environment The author is internationally known for his extensive research on many topics of nuclear physics.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author should be complimented for a clear and concise discussion of all important topics of nuclear physics. This book is suitable for a one semester survey course in nuclear physics to be given in physics and nuclear engineering departments. I have taught introductory course in nuclear physics at Renssaeler Polytecnique Institute for many years and would have adopted this book if it was then available. I would recommend this book to other professors teaching an introductory survey course on nuclear physics.
