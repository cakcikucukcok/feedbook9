  <title>The Ultimate Theory of Everything - Roy R Porter Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;   The Ultimate Theory of Everything and Other Misguided Thought Experiments will have you rethinking the conception of &quot;Time&quot; as we know it. It will also entertain you with some  humorous ways of looking at some old and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   http://ultimate-theory-of-everything.com/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ideas put forth in this book be what Einstein and other Physicists have overlooked? Could this lead to a Final Theory, Flying Cars, Field Propulsion or more?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   I have no idea! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   These are just &quot;thought experiments&quot;! So far no one has ever proven or dis proven these ideas (or maybe could care less).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   It is intended to lead readers down the path of &quot;Thinking Outside the Book&quot; and to explore other ways of looking at things. Could this lead to breakthroughs in physics? I make no predictions about that! Although, any &quot;wrong ideas&quot; I set forth as thought experiments here may inspire someone else to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   Above all, it is to be experienced in your own way. Always remember that the ideas here are nothing more than ideas and NOT proven facts. What sets it apart is that many ideas (or delusions!) presented here have never been found anywhere else!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;   And maybe for good reason?&lt;/p&gt;" />
