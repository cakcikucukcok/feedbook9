  <title>Beyond the World of Relativity to the World of Invariance - Thanh Giang Nguyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Clerk Maxwell turned the scientific world upside down in the late nineteenth century with his theory of electromagnetism, which predicted that an electromagnetic wave would propagate in vacuum with a constant speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His prediction was at odds with classical mechanics, and some scientists devised new ideas to reconcile the discrepancy. One of them was Albert Einstein, who proposed the theory of relativity in the early twentieth century, which became a pillar of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation E = mc2 sparked a revolution of perspectiveresulting in the perspective of absolute time and space that had prevailed in Newtonian mechanics being displaced by the perspective of relativistic space-time in Einsteins theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanh Giang Nguyen, however, realized while studying the theory of relativity that fundamental concepts in Newtonian mechanics can also be used to show 
E = mc2, as outlined in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author on an incredible journey into a distinct world that is defined by absolute space and time when you go Beyond the World of Relativity to the World of Invariance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
