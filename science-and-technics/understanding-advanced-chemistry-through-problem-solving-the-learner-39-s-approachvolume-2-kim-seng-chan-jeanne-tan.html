  <title>Understanding Advanced Chemistry Through Problem Solving: The Learner&#39;s ApproachVolume 2 - Kim Seng Chan, Jeanne Tan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written for students taking either the University of Cambridge Advanced Level examinations or the International Baccalaureate examinations, this guidebook covers essential topics and concepts under both stipulated chemistry syllabi. The book is written in such a way as to guide the reader through the understanding and applications of essential chemical concepts using the problem solving approach. The authors have also retained the popular discourse feature from their previous two books &amp;#x2014; Understanding Advanced Physical Inorganic Chemistry and Understanding Advanced Organic and Analytical Chemistry &amp;#x2014; to help the learners better understand and see for themselves, how the concepts should be applied during solving problems. Based on the Socratic Method, questions are implanted throughout the book to help facilitate the reader&amp;#x0027;s development in forming logical conclusions of concepts and the way they are being applied to explain the problems. In addition, the authors have also included important summaries and concept maps to help the learners to recall, remember, reinforce and apply the fundamental chemical concepts in a simple way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics are explored through an explanatory and inquiry-based approach. They are interrelated and easy to understand, with succinct explanations/examples being included, especially on areas that students frequently find difficult. Topics address the whys and hows behind key concepts to be mastered, so that the concepts are made understandable and intuitive for students. The focus is on conceptual learning so as to equip students with knowledge for critical learning and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing A-level or IB guidebooks generally introduce concepts in a matter-of-fact manner. This book adds a unique pedagogical edge which few can rival. Through their many years of teaching experiences, the authors have acquired a sound awareness of common students&amp;#x0027; misconceptions which are relayed through the questions and thus help to reinforce concepts learnt. This book is essential and useful to help the students to be adequately prepared for their high stake examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldscientific.com/page/inspection-copy&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Request Inspection Copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- /remove --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contents:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structure and Bonding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isomerism in Organic Compounds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organic Reactions and Mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alkanes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alkenes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arenes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halogen Derivatives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohols and Phenol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbonyl Compounds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amino Acids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polymers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summary of Important Organic Reactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readership:&lt;/b&gt; JC students and teaching professionals in Chemistry.&lt;br&gt;" />
