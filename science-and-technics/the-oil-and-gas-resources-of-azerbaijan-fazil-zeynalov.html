  <title>The Oil and Gas Resources of Azerbaijan - Fazil Zeynalov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since its independence, thanks to the rational and controlled use of its natural resources and the diversification of its oil and gas pipelines, Azerbaijan has become a major regional energy hub, an essential contributor to most of the large-scale projects in the region, and a new commercial and security partner for Europe. It is committed to an ambitious strategy of diversified economic development. Azerbaijan, which has the world&#39;s most ancient oil industry, has left behind its relative anonymity of the Soviet era and become an independent player on the stage of Eurasian energy. As a researcher at the Baku State University, the author, Fazil Zeynalov, provides a particularly pertinent geostrategic study of Azerbaijan and its energy policies. He explains the changing history of Azerbaijan&#39;s energy reserves since the Middle Ages and presents the importance and geopolitical prospects of the Caspian Sea. This detailed and informative publication is recommended reading for teachers, researchers and students, as well as members of the wider public wishing to understand the international issues associated with the Caspian, and more broadly with the region that links Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
