  <title>Learning to Survive Infinity - Steven J. Bingel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some things are like this and our attempts to scrutinize only make the obscurity worse. For those of us always on this edge is where we function best. Chaos, erratic behavior, it all adds fuel to the fire. Makes us keep chasing the elusive answer, always there, right on the tip of your tongue. Like a familiar face sharing some space on a crowded subway in Manhattan while visiting your daughter, you nod your head, smile and say how you been?, hoping that the face will divulge who he is so you wont feel terrible because he remembered you, but you cant remember his name. 
Like the human psyche going through a mid-life crisis, where the divergence of two opposing behaviors causes one to have a nervous breakdown, quantum physics seeks to lie on the outskirts of our imagination. The outskirts are its perturbation point as referred to by physicists. The place where we barely are cognizant of its existence. Like our unconscious mind, small glimpses appear fleetingly that titillate our conscious mind. They may appear in a Jungian dream. They may appear as synchronicities, or de-ja vu. There is something guttural in human nature about new discovery. It has been inside all of us, a sleeping giant awakened occasionally. It teases us, gives us a view that is obscured like flying IFR on a socked in day. The instruments can only tell you so much and you are forced to their attention, giving in to stolen glances outside the cockpit window at the elusive ground below. It is a hair-raising experience albeit---thrilling." />
