  <title>Poachers, Polluters and Politics: A Fishery Officer&#39;s Career - Randy Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Retired fishery officer Randy Nelson&amp;#8217;s first love was catching poachers. That obsession, plus a devious mind and enthusiasm for marathon running, spelled big trouble for law-breaking fishermen. Thirty-five years in the field (and stream) netted a gold mine of stories with hair-raising tales of grizzly bear attacks, angry axe-wielding, rock-throwing, shotgun-blasting fishermen and high-speed chases on dirt roads and through bush. Poachers, Polluters and Politics provides a rare glimpse into the lives of DFO officers and the communities in which they live. Here too are stories showing the lighter side of the DFO, like how Nelson honed his &amp;#147;psychic powers,&amp;#8221; and recollections of life in a rodent-infested, government-issue trailer&amp;#151;where his wife Lorraine once awoke to find a mouse chewing her hair.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Firm but fair, and always innovative, Randy Nelson usually earned the&amp;#151;often grudging&amp;#151;respect of communities and fishermen he encountered. Whether it meant carving a peephole in a hollow tree or teaching his dog to sniff for salmon, Nelson was constantly scheming up new and tricky ways to catch poachers and polluters, many of them known violent criminals. Nelson spent a career dedicated to protecting BC&amp;#8217;s waters and fish population and his passion for his work shines through with every word, drawing the reader into the exciting world of protecting wildlife and prosecuting bad guys.&lt;/div&gt;" />
