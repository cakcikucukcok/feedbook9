  <title>Wildfire and Americans - Roger G. Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three years after Roger Kennedy retired as director of the National Park Service, from his Santa Fe home he watched as the Cerro Grande Fire moved across the Pajarito Plateau and into Los Alamos. Two hundred and thirty-five homes were destroyed, more than 45,000 acres of forest were burned, and the nation&#39;s nuclear laboratories were threatened; even before the embers had died a blame game erupted. Kennedy&#39;s career as a public servant, which encompasses appointments under five presidential administrations, convinced him that the tragedy would produce scapegoats and misinformation, and leave American lives at risk. That was unacceptable, even unforgivable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wildfire and Americans &lt;/i&gt;is a passionate, deeply informed appeal that we acknowledge wildfire not as a fire problem but as a people problem. Americans are in the wrong places, damningly because they were encouraged to settle there. Politicians, scientists, and CEOs acting out of patriotism, hubris, and greed have&lt;br&gt;placed their fellow countrymen in harm&#39;s way. And now, with global warming, we inhabit a landscape that has become much more dangerous. Grounded in the conviction that we owe a duty to our environment and our fellow man, &lt;i&gt;Wildfire and Americans &lt;/i&gt;is more than a depiction of policies gone terribly awry. It is a plea to acknowledge the mercy we owe nature and mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
