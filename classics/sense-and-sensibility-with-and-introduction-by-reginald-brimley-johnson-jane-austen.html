  <title>Sense and Sensibility (with and Introduction by Reginald Brimley Johnson) - Jane Austen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Austen’s first published novel, “Sense and Sensibility” is the classic coming of age story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who have contrasting temperaments. On the surface Elinor, the older sister represents sense, or reason, while Marianne represents sensibility, or emotion; however upon closer examination we find that they both exhibit varying aspects of each characteristic. Set in southwest England, in the towns of London and Kent, the novel follows the lives of the two sisters as they struggle to find love, romance, and ultimately deal with the heartbreaks along the way. The novel ponders the question of which is the best characteristic, sense or sensibility. It is unclear ultimately what Austen intended as the answer to this question, whether or not she left the novel purposefully ambiguous or if her suggestion is that a proper temperament requires some measure of both qualities. “Sense and Sensibility” is a compelling study of character and one of the great achievements of the romantic genre. This edition includes an introduction by Reginald Brimley Johnson and a biographical afterword." />
