          &lt;strong&gt;He had only 72 hours… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the clock ticking, U.S. Marshal Gideon Brand knew a little girl would die unless he could convince genuine psychic Marysia O&#39;Hurley to help him. But he never planned to enlist Marysia&#39;s help with bullets flying in the background and her as his unwilling hostage! She wanted a lifetime…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now the two are on the race of their lives to discover the link between the plane crash that killed Marysia&#39;s husband and the disappearance of a judge&#39;s granddaughter. And as Marysia learns to embrace–and not curse–her ESP, she&#39;s about to discover another more passionate side to herself in the sexy lawman&#39;s arms….&lt;/p&gt;
