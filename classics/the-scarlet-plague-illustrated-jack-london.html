  <title>The Scarlet Plague (Illustrated) -  Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a&lt;br /&gt;
railroad. But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on&lt;br /&gt;
either side swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested&lt;br /&gt;
across it in a green wave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow&lt;br /&gt;
as a man&amp;rsquo;s body, and was no more than a wild-animal runway.&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally, a piece of rusty iron, showing through the forestmould,&lt;br /&gt;
advertised that the rail and the ties still remained. In one&lt;br /&gt;
place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at a connection, had lifted the&lt;br /&gt;
end of a rail clearly into view. The tie had evidently followed the rail,&lt;br /&gt;
held to it by the spike long enough for its bed to be filled with gravel&lt;br /&gt;
and rotten leaves, so that now the crumbling, rotten timber thrust&lt;br /&gt;
itself up at a curious slant. Old as the road was, it was manifest that&lt;br /&gt;
it had been of the mono-rail type." />
