        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;After one too many death threats, Sheik Efraim Aziz was ready to end his business in Wyoming and head home.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But one last horse ride had kept him in town a little longer. Callie McGuire had followed him on his private journey, leaving him mesmerized by her beauty and just enough time to save her from the gunshots they both barely escaped. Now, figuring out who was targeting them would keep him glued to her side no matter how much she claimed she didn&#39;t need his protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With their list of suspects growing - along with their attraction - Efraim found working with Callie an unexpected pleasure. Suddenly, despite the danger surrounding them, Wyoming seemed so much more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
