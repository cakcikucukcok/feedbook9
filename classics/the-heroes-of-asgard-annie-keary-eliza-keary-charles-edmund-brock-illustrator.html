Odin stepped forth calm and unruffled, spread his arms towards the sky, and called out to the spirits of the wind, Cease, strange Vanir, cease your rough play, and tell us in what manner we have offended you that you serve us thus. Annie and Eliza Keary&amp;#39;s tales from Scandinavian mythlogy, The heroes of Asgard, was first published in 1870, and are drawn from the northern mythes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the beginning of ages there lived a cow, whose breath was sweet, and whose milk was bitter. This cow was called Audhumla, and she lived all by herself on a frosty, misty plain, where there was nothing to be seen but heaps of snow and ice piled strangely over one another. Far away to the north it was night, far away to the south it was day; but all around where Audhumla lay a cold, grey twilight reigned. By-and-by a giant came out of the dark north, and lay down upon the ice near Audhumla." />
