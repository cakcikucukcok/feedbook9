          &lt;strong&gt;After coming home and finding her father unconscious and her mother mysteriously missing, homicide cop Savannah Tallfeather teamed up with the one person she knew she could trust.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Riley Frazier had faced a similar situation nearly two years ago and his quest for the truth was both honorable and heartbreaking. But when their investigation uncovered more questions than answers, Savannah found herself turning to Riley for much more…intimate reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Time and again Riley&#39;s comforting embrace, the penetrating blue depths of his eyes, allowed Savannah to momentarily forget why they were working together in the first place. Until evidence was found, linking their pasts and forever uniting their futures….&lt;/p&gt;
