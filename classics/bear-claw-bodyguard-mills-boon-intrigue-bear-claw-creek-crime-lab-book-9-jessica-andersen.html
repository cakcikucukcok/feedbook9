          &lt;strong&gt;Hot on the trail of a ruthless underground drug ring, homicide detective Jack Williams won&#39;t let anything interfere with his hunt. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not the dead-end leads, not the danger. And especially not being pulled off his case to protect Dr. Tori Bay. He can handle guarding a beautiful scientist who plays by her own rules. But keeping her out of his arms is a challenge he hadn&#39;t expected.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still, her survival depends on Jack&#39;s instincts and he isn&#39;t about to jeopardize her safety to indulge an overwhelming attraction. Jack has faced his share of challenges and usually came out on top. This time, though, as a showdown with the enemy quickly approaches, it&#39;ll take all his professional skills to ignore some very personal impulses…&lt;/p&gt;
