  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Jolly Corner -  Henry James</i></b> | "The Jolly Corner" is a short story by Henry James published first in the magazine The English Review of December, 1908. One of James' most noted ghost stories , "The Jolly Corner" describes the adventures of Spencer Brydon as he prowls the now-empty New York house where he grew up.<br /><b><i>The Jolly Corner - Wikipedia</i></b> | The Jolly Corner is a lovely, if at times obscure tale of a middle age man reflecting back not upon the life he led, but on the one he didn't live. Like Henry James, our main character Spencer Brydon has absconded to the continent, disdaining the city of his forefathers, but happily living off the rents that allow him to reside comfortably in Europe.<br /><b><i>The Jolly Corner: James, Henry: 9781986443999: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Jolly Corner -  Henry James</a> </h3></p><hr/>
