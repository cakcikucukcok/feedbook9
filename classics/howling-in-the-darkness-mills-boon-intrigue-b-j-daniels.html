          &lt;strong&gt;GUARDIAN OF THE NIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Danger! Undercover agent Jonah Ries couldn&#39;t explain to the stunning woman who&#39;d mistaken him for her blind date exactly how he knew someone was trying to harm her. But evil stalked Moriah&#39;s Landing, and Katherine Ridgemont was its target. When she learned of Jonah&#39;s deep secret, Kat might not give him the time of day. Only that wouldn&#39;t stop Jonah from watching over the vulnerable beauty after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the anniversary of Kat&#39;s mother&#39;s mysterious death approached, the instinct to protect became a fire in Jonah&#39;s blood. A fire matched by his determination to save the woman he loved from the unknown forces that haunted the night….&lt;/p&gt;
