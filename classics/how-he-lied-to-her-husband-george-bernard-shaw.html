  <title>How He Lied to Her Husband - George Bernard Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The three-character play is set in the drawing room of a flat located on Cromwell Road in London. Shaw describes Henry Apjohn as a very beautiful youth, moving as in a dream, walking as on air, while Aurora Bompas has an air of being a young and beautiful woman but as a matter of hard fact, she is, dress and pretensions apart, a very ordinary South Kensington female of about 37, hopelessly inferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth. The third character is Aurora&#39;s husband Teddy, a robust, thicknecked, well groomed city man, with a strong chin but a blithering eye and credulous mouth." />

In its preface he described it as "a sample of what can be done with even the most hackneyed stage framework by filling it in with an observed touch of actual humanity instead of with doctrinaire romanticism."<br /><b><i>How He Lied to Her Husband - Wikipedia</i></b> | Shaw was particularly conscious of the exploitation of the working class. How He Lied to Her Husband is a one act play set in an English drawing room. The characters are Henry, a beautiful young man, a middle aged woman, and her husband, Teddy. Aurora is distressed because poems written by Henry, her lover, are gone.<br /><b><i>How He Lied to Her Husband: Shaw, George Bernard ...</i></b> | How He Lied to Her Husband [Shaw, George Bernard] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
