Eleanor Emily Hodgman Porter (December 19, 1868 &amp;ndash; May 21, 1920) was an American novelist.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Porter achieved considerable commercial success: Pollyanna ranked eighth among best-selling novels in the United States during 1913, second during 1914, and fourth during 1915 (with 47 printings between 1915 and 1920); Just David ranked third in 1916; The Road to Understanding ranked fourth in 1917; and Oh Money!
