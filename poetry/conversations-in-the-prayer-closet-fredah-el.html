  <title>Conversations In the Prayer Closet - Fredah El</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you had face time with God what would you want to talk about? Inside are conversations in the form of poems to God. The poems vary from funny to heartfelt and serious discussions with God. Some of the poems may be thoughts and/or questions you may have wondered and never thought to address them with God. The poems are not to instruct one on how to pray but to give insight that there are no subjects whether serious or comical that we cannot discuss with God. The book also has a prayer to share; each prayer poem is written twice with one to keep and one to share.  Fredah El was born in Florida, a US veteran and currently living in New Mexico. Throughout my travels of life I have been asking questions. Some of the questions I could not get answers for and it prompted me to writing my questions to God in the form of poems." />
