  <title>Incomplete Texts - Mohammed Y. Burhan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Incomplete Texts&lt;/i&gt; strives to encapsulate man&#39;s ordeal on this earth along with the story of the very beginning of creation in thirty short poems. How will we meet doomsday? What makes life what it is?  Incomplete Texts is a collection of poems, essays and thoughts that reveal the authors perspective on the secrets of life and the unlocked feelings that memories of the past raise when they collide with the reality of the present and the fear of the unknown future. 
&lt;i&gt;The chemistry of happiness 
Do not seize life 
With struggle and strife. 
Let pass of it 
Without even a greet 
Like a woman, a stranger,  
We only wish we capture. 
Among all things, the prettier  
Leave in our memory a flower.
Do not seize delight 
O beast, O hurt 
Your prey is prettier before 
It is eaten and killed, far more,
Spend your time just watching 
Behind that wall of timing  
Pray for the wheat for the smell
Of the rain over there where you dwell. 
Share with the whisper of the wind 
The delightful weddings that had passed. 
Nations told nations and their speech spread 
That the earth is round like a loaf of bread;
And that crying, like laughter, 
Is a moment following the other&lt;/i&gt;" />
