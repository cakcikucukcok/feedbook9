  <title>Water and Life - Adolph (Adolfo) Caso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adolph (Adolfo) has been writing poems since his high school days, in both English and Italian, depending on his mood or on the subject. He confesses to no knowing the language he is using until after the poem is completed. As for his photography&amp;mdash;all very personal, the photos may not necessarily complement the poems. Natural beauty often may better be captured with a camera than through a poem.&lt;br&gt;    His poems are in free verse, more precisely, in word clusters. He does not use traditional rhythm or rhyme, but emphasizes the natural sound of the words themselves. Single words become whole lines, especially adverbs such as divinamente.&lt;br&gt;    Not adhering to any school of poetry, his poems emanate from within his soul as water springs from the ground and spreads through the land as rivers, at times gentle and soothing, at times as rampant floods. Nevertheless, according to Adolfo, without water life would be chemistry without biology." />
