  <title>Sifting the Ashes - jaelynn cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sifting the Ashes chronicles jaelynns life as an African-American baby boomer facing new challenges that her mother never faced: Corporate America, instant material success, and growing up in an sexually open society.
It is a graphic account of how a southern &quot;good little girl&quot; who was raised in the church with two loving parents struggled with low self- esteem and long bouts of depression.  Her attempt to be accepted caused her to be used by several men which fueled her contempt of herself even more. &lt;P&gt;
Jaelynn discusses openly the consequences of multiple partners, the day that she seriously thought of suicide and the breakthrough that is a work in progress four years later.  The verbal and physical abuse at the hands of her husband plus a failed relationship after the marriage caused her to mentally break down and seek help to determine why she was not worthy enough to love.&lt;P&gt;
Sifting the Ashes is written in poems, a manuscript that originally started as a therapeutic way for jaelynn to face her life and see, although painful, the power of the experiences in her life.  Her sister, after reading the book told her that she needed to pursue publishing the book for others to share this unique story. After several friends read and agreed the importance of her lessons, jaelynn decided to share this journal with others to realize that the light we are looking for from others can always be found within." />
