  <title>Hear Me Write - Donnamichelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I wrote my first book Something for Your Journey I was completely focused on sharing all I had learned through the Bible and how it changed my life.  All I wanted at the time was for those who were expecting changes in their life through faith to know was that their faith was the key and that God was absolutely with them.  No matter what it seemed to look like.  It has proven to be a great tool in spiritual growth and I love the feedback I have received from it.
Hear Me Write is a compilation of moments in time.  Moments that made a difference in my life or in the life of another.  I have enjoyed looking back while putting this book together.  I have also enjoyed the reminder of how very beautiful life can be as we grow and overcome the obstacles in our way.  Most importantly I have enjoyed the view from my book of endless possibilities that lie ahead.  I am truly proud to present to you my second book of poetry Hear Me Write." />
