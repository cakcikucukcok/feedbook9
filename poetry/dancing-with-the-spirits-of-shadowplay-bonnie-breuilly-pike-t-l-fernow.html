  <title>Dancing with the Spirits of Shadowplay - Bonnie Breuilly-Pike, T.L Fernow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No matter what the faith or season of the year, all human beings seek everyday epiphanies; occasions when we can experience the sacred and the beautiful in the absolute ordinary. In doing so, we come to an awakening that we cannot afford to throw away even one more &quot;unimportant&quot; day by not noticing the wonder of it all.
    Sometimes, we just forget to take the time to honestly see our world; most times actually. Some of the simplest things that make us feel alive, and more importantly loved, are right at our fingertips or just outside our backdoor and we constantly seem to either ignore or miss them:
	A good morning kiss. 
	The first real day of spring every year. 
	An unexpected call from your significant other to just say I love you. 
	The appreciative wag of your dogs tail when you give him his favorite treat.
	 The scent of a newly opened rose bud. 
	The hug your grandchild gives you when he runs across the yard when he first sees you.
    However, Bonnie Pike seems to notice all of these things and more. She has the wonderful talent to put into words those feelings and emotions of life with all of its loves as well as its pains
This is Bonnie&#39;s third volume of poetry. Her prior volumes &quot;Survive The Shadowstalker; A Poetic Journey Through Abuse&quot;,was released in 2002 and &quot;Shadows Of Love, was released in 2011.  In this compilation of poetry, Bonnie takes you through the natural order of life which she has gleaned through her love of her adopted home state of AZ.
Do you want to come and play, and dance, and dream? Then meet Bonnie at the Superstition Mountain, just off the Apache Trail, and she will show you the way. Come and dance with the spirits of shadowplay." />
