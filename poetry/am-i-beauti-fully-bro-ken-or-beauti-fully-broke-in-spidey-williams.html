  <title>Am I Beauti Fully Bro-Ken or Beauti Fully Broke-In? - Spidey Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every time I write my life story, it comes out how I feel but not always what I see. Every time I look in the mirror, it shows me all I can never hide raw &amp; uncensored. It gives truth to me. How many of us have an alias pen name, nickname that were known as, other than our birth name? You dont have to raise your hand or nod your head, but at least try to smile even if its hard. I was bred &amp; raised a Christian, but I feel I am less of a man &amp; more of a God. Every poem I write at least one person like, but the ones written in sorrow &amp; blood, People never forget &amp; surprisingly love. Its hard for me to bleed externally when Ive been bleeding internally since I was born. By age eleven I had 13 wisdom teeth, &amp; doctors call me extraordinary, by 14 I was suspended 15 times in two years, statistics called me ordinary! By 17 I was brilliant again, from publishing my first poetry book, result of heartbroken. Should have told the witch doctor never heal me, shouldve congratulated Cupid, for failing again, should have went to every wishing well, &amp; retrieved every penny for my thoughts, instead of publishing my first poetry book, entitled, Poems From The Heart&lt;br&gt;" />
