  <title>“Shatters of My Broken Heart” - YaRonnica Harris-Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="INTRODUCTION
The following literature was derived from when I was younger and making attempts to be in love
only to grow older and realize that all along, I was only in love with a thought. I was in love with the idea of being in love, just imagining the cozy comforting feelings of all the elements that love possesses within one&#39;s heart shared with another. Desires to fulfill the urges inside of M3 that wanted so vulnerably to care for a young lady demonstrating the actions of a gentleman, being that I am a girl, I call myself a Gentlewoman. I live to provide for special ladies in my life. The affectionate compassion of my hearts&#39; mentality is only to show that there is good in relationships, there is love in hearts, there are truths in words and there is trust in promises. Though my intentions were miraculous, I&#39;ve been taking for granted, branded and broken down, but stand strong to this day; you&#39;ll be Auhmazed to hear through it all, what I&#39;ve found. With the Shatters of My Broken heart, I present to you, My Music Book of Poetry.
This is my music book of poetry
emotions that hung pain over M3,
speak of my exes, they ain&#39;t over M3.
How I made it, that&#39;s how it&#39;s posed to be.
I only dared to let certain ones get close to M3.
They played my love, say I broke their hearts,
scarred my emotions, blamed M3 that we&#39;re apart,
and still is in denial that I loved em from the start.
But my angel fell from the stars at the time I stopped looking for love.
I thank the lord, now I can&#39;t be without her, I can&#39;t give her up.
This is my music book of poetry,
loves that really tried to lower M3.
My ex females live by no loyalty,
all I wanted was love and in return I would spoil thee.
Instead they left M3 with crazy stories that dropped my
heart from a building of endless stories.
I can chuck up the deuces counting my few exes that weren&#39;t worthy.
Oh yea, in God I trust I had no worries.
All my focus now is to get this money and provide for my family, 
cuz at the end of the day I know I only have God, My Love, them and M3.
Enjoy this Journey as you explore My mind." />
