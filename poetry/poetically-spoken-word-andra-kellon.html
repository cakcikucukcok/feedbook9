  <title>Poetically Spoken Word - Andra Kellon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, POETICALLY SPOKEN WORD, is my very first book! It is simply a collection of poetry pieces that Ive written over the years. 
Ive poured my heart into this book! Although POETICALLY SPOKEN WORD is a collection of poetry pieces, it could also very well be my autobiography. Each piece precisely reflects my character, personality and beliefs. There is a level of transparency contained in these writings that almost forces you to become as one with the author. I believe transparency is paramount when attempting to reach others by means of testimony combined with poetical prose. 
While reading this book, youll personally travel with me from the devilish depths and despair of active alcohol and drug addictions with all of its atrocities, all the way to a place of unutterable joy and gratitude positioned inside the veil and face-to-face with The Father and The Son with The Holy Spirit being your guide. I pray this book draws you closer to the majestic favor, graces, and redemptive powers of a life lived in Salvation." />
