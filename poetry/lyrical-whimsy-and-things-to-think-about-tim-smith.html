  <title>Lyrical Whimsy and Things to Think About - Tim Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Lyrical Whimsy and Things to Think About, Tim Smith shares his collection of forty poems that touch on such poignant and relatable topics as true and unrequited love, dating, death, and friendship.&lt;p&gt;
In a compilation written in three parts and inspired by his experiences living in rural Illinois, Smith offers a glimpse inside his heart as he journeys from loss and heartache to joy and love. From his compelling poem I Would Rather Die Than Divorce You where Smith candidly chronicles the loneliness of emotional distance in a marriage, to the poem Everything With You where he touches on the moment he realized he just found his soul mate, Smith provides the world with his unique perspective on relationships.&lt;p&gt;
In an eclectic mix of old style flair and a modern whimsical flow, Smith eloquently captures the essence of what it is like inside the heart of a man who, on a pilgrimage to discover himself, ends up finding true love in the process." />
