  <title>Rivers to the Sea - Sara Teasdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The tragic Sara Teasdale was one of the foremost female poets of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with her formal style and focus on romance. &amp;quot;Rivers To the Sea&amp;quot; is a solid collection of her work, and has many of her best-known love poems in it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the early twentieth century saw the blossoming of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; poetry, Teasdale stuck to more formal prose: &amp;quot;The fountain shivers lightly in the rain/the laurels drip, the fading roses fall/the marble satyr plays a mournful strain/That leaves the rainy fragrance musical.&amp;quot; Not terribly original in HOW it&amp;#39;s written, but the rich language is all the more striking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Teasdale experimented late in her life, &amp;quot;Rivers to the Sea&amp;quot; mostly sticks to formal styles. Sometimes she did dense, intense, longer poems that seemed to have been written a long time ago. &amp;quot;Ah, Love there is no fleeing from thy might,/No lonely place where thou hast never trod,/No desert thou hast left uncarpeted/With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clever imagery and timeless emotion and at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on where you are in your life you will seize the positive or accentuate the negative or just bask in the melancholy.&lt;br /&gt;
