  <title>Morning Come Quick - Marcus Uganda White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Morning Come Quick is a compilation of poetry written during a time spoken word regained nationwide appeal in the U.S. and abroad as interest in poetry began to flourish among people of all ages and backgrounds. The poems were crafted in forms resembling traditional forms, prose, and free verse. The poet migrates and escapes being confined to a specific categorical type of author. To create a definitive conception of the writer from reading one poem would be to lay barriers in realizing the true intention of the man throughout the work. The title poem was written while living in Naples, Italy from 2000 to 2003 and being impacted by the changes America faced on a global scale. Many moments to gain clarity and solitude have resulted in the poetry of this book. To truly transpose the beauty and equally meaningful ugliness of the settings is a task as difficult as discontinuing the process of creating the art. Evenings constricted with love, pain, confusion, or inspiration and the mornings prayerful, delighted, fearful, or humdrum have all sifted through to live as words." />
