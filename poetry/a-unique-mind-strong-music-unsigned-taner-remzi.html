  <title>A Unique Mind, Strong Music Unsigned - Taner Remzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have compiled this for many reasons. I have found I take solace and enjoyment in writing, expressing myself surprisingly well, in an articulate and entertaining way. It started as writing paragraphs of my unique observations, and explanations of my song themes, attempting to detach myself. Having a Turkish background whilst growing up in Australia also contributes to my unique experiences and views. After I garnered interest in a publisher, I started writing about everything. So I thought why not be one who writes a record of family memories, with nostalgic insights into times passed? Its also an invaluable chance to explain the workings of my unique mind and giving people an inside view of my frustrations in life and the field of music. Ive also included lyrics to some of my music as a teaser or prelude if you should want to discover some tracks that are available. I thought it easier to avoid names, except in the public eye. I refer to many people both past and present. Those of you who know me will know who you are if I refer to you. People will relate with my experiences and struggles. Above all, its giving my life more meaning and rhyme, realizing Ive perhaps achieved more than I ever realized. That, I hope, will be the catalyst for the most exciting and productive times in future years." />
