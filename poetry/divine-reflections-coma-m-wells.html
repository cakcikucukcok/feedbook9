  <title>Divine Reflections - Coma M. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Divine Reflections is a book of spiritual poetry. God and His Son, Jesus are my first love, and I profoundly enjoy writing about them through poetry.The poems are enlightening and spiritually significant in worshipping and serving them.The principle aspects of the poems are to promote Gods Word, and encourage saintly behavior.This is imperative to all Gods people who want a closer relationship with Him. He loves all His people, whether they are a believer or non-believer.Yet, its His desire to have everyone love and glorify Him, repent for their sins, and accept Jesus as their Savior.In addition, He wants them to embody the Holy Ghost, and live their lives steadfast in Faith and works, exercising holiness. Saintly behavior rooted in holiness is the crown all believers and saints of God desire to wear in their heaven oriented relationship with Him, and His son, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Divine Reflections consist of lucent accounts of Jesus life, saint building prayers, and a diversity of praises. These are enjoyable powerful spiritual elements that govern true believers and saints of God.The family and nature poems are crafted from a natural point of view, true to spiritual roots.The nature poems applaud Gods creations, herald praises and thanksgiving for His all knowing and omnipresent spirit.The family poems conveyed in tender simplicity, are Gods superior natural blessings.They are endowed to all His people, both the believer and nonbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Divine Reflections has been a delight for me to write. Im a saint of God, and its gives me great pleasure to craft poems based on His Word.I love Gods Word, and with the help of the Holy Ghost, I strive to exhibit the saintly behavior that it commands.In doing so, Im earnestly seeking His promise of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Its my hope, the vividly crafted poems, first and foremost will inspire the reader to read Gods Word more and heed the spiritual principles that encourage saintly behavior.Its also my hope for the reader to enjoy reading the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
