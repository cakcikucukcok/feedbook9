  <title>Poems for the Day - Sherril L. Carss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book Poems for the Day is a compilation of Poems written at a deeply tormented time of my life. I wrote my first poems when I was on a houseboat at Smiths Creek on Hawkesbury River in N.S.W. a time that seemed to pull the Poems out of me. That was in 2007, when I wrote my first Poetry, only about six Poems in all, I have included some of them in my book for you to read. Then no more Poems until the Christmas of 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From Christmas 2010 through 2011, I wrote poems like Mad Woman they just poured out of me, like a waterfall, and no one was more surprised than me! A very faith filled, anxiety laced time, and at this point space doesnt permit me to go in too. Sufficient to day, writing Poetry was a very comforting pass time for me, and being a big fan and student of William Shakespeare, Poetry has always held a Special Place in my Heart right from my Grade six reader, where I discovered My Country by Dorothy McKellar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is my hope that whoever reads my poetry will be warmed inside out of by my Poems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Poems like When someone you love is sick will help you to understand where I was coming from at a very difficult and creative time in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Thank you for sharing my experience, for you makes it all worthwhile!" />
