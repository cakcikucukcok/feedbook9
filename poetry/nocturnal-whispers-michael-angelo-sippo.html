  <title>Nocturnal Whispers - Michael Angelo Sippo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author of Drifting Seasons returns with his second poetry collection of sonnets, short stories, and a new epic tale. Nocturnal Whispers shares the emotional thoughts, prayers, and inner struggles we face alone while pondering late at night or lying awake in bed. Inspired by personal experiences and events, the author teases these feeling through riddles and lullabies along with a new cast of war torn soldiers, mystical mages and love stricken romantics. 
The author again uses different rhyming patterns to give each character a unique voice and personality while implementing various structures to give each piece a different perspective. Step into the worn boots of lonely veterans looking for acceptance, pray with the lost souls looking for a second chance and fall into the embrace of a loved one who will make you feel safe while you rest. 
Through hidden messages and play on words, the author asks his reads to think outside what is normally perceived and to look at each story closely with a different view. He also invites his readers to place themselves into each character to connect with each feeling and maybe evening find something deeper about themselves. Each story can be read alone or shared with family and friends of all ages whether it is to tackle a question in your head, to share a story while tucking someone in bed, to send good wishes to a loved one far away, or dream that someone special comes close to you this day. 
So many times we feel alone at night and wonder what to do. Use these moments to sit back and reflect. Listen to what the night and your surroundings whisper. Let go of the emotions we anchor within ourselves deep. Let each riddle ease your worries away, let each lullaby bring you a sweat dream, and let each story provide a sense of hope and help you arise to a new day." />
