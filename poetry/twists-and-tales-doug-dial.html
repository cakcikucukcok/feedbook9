  <title>Twists and Tales - Doug Dial</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twists &amp; Tales is Doug&#39;s third volume of poetry and writings.  This book contains a little something for everyone.  You will discover poetry, tongue twisters, and tales on various themes such as faith, love, family life and hardships.  Intertwined with the more serious writings you will come across thoughts filled with hilarity, absurdity and wittiness.  Anyone reading this work will be enriched, inspired and entertained.  Since life comes to us in quite a random fashion, Doug decided to publish this work in much the same way.  At times, the reader will be treated to a poem or tale of spiritual content, only to be followed by a humorous poem or a tongue twister.  Throughout the book are Twists &amp; Tales of love and loss and living large, which will cause the reader to pause and reflect on the simple things in life.  As was true for his first two books, once you pick it up you won&#39;t want to set it down until the last page has been read." />
