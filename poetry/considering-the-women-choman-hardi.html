  <title>Considering the Women - Choman Hardi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Choman Hardi&quot;??s Considering the Women explores the equivocal relationship between immigrants and their homeland &quot;?? the constant push and pull &quot;?? as well as the breakdown of an intermarriage, and the plight of women in an aggressive patriarchal society and as survivors of political violence. The book&quot;??s central sequence, Anfal, draws on Choman Hardi&quot;??s post-doctoral research on women survivors of genocide in Kurdistan. The stories of eleven survivors (nine women, an elderly man and a boy child) are framed by the radically shifting voice of the researcher: naÃ¯ve and matter-of-fact at the start; grieved, abstracted and confused by the end. Knowledge has a noxious effect in this book, destroying the poet&quot;??s earlier optimistic sense of self and replacing it with a darker identity where she is ready for &quot;??all the good people in the world to disappoint her&quot;??. Hardi&quot;??s second collection in English ends with a new beginning found in new love and in taking time off from the journey of traumatic discovery to enjoy the small, ordinary things of life.
