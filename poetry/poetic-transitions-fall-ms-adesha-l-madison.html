  <title>Poetic Transitions Fall: - Ms. Adesha L. Madison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Poetic Transitions Fall:  2nd of a 4-Part Poetry Series&quot; is as it reads, the follow-up book to &quot;Poetic Transitions Winter:  1st of a 4-Part Poetry Series&quot;.  This book contains poetry that has been written during my adult life.  Poetry that is not as &quot;dark&quot; as the first book seeing that it contained the elements of a stage of my life that included lots of death.  But, this book does contain the intimate details of an era of my adult life that concerned lots of relationships, especially with men, whether they were relationships with my sons, fathers, husband, or friends.  There is likewise poetry, as there will always in each issue be, that is dedicated to loved ones gone, but not forgotten.  This poetry is real.  Love, lust, desire, intimacy, respect,  intimidation, deceit, rejection, affection, are all appropriate adjectives to describe some of the feelings that this book subjects you too.  Each book is designed to become &quot;lighter and lighter&quot; in its contents, with the final episode hopefully being totally about God.  Someone stated at a poetry reading that an author once told her that when we share our poetry we give the audience a piece of us, I hope that this piece of me, Fall, will enlighten you to the windy and color-changing portion of my life." />
