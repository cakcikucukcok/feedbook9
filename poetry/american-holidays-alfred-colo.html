  <title>American Holidays - Alfred Colo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are distinctly American holidays, excluding Christmas and Easter, which are global and more universal in nature, and much too expansive, requiring broader strokes than this shorter treatise can contain in its restricted space.
Holidays remind our nation of Gods miracles: in His plan to fortify us all for lifes daily struggles. At Christmas, do our thoughts revolve around presents mostly? Is Easter only a warm anticipation of Spring, and is Thanksgiving, the quest for family reunion and a delicious meal?
Remembering the spiritual origins of such special occassions affords us worship opportunities for Gods goodness to us, and to our families, friends and to our nation; through them we may reflect upon our blessings, while celebrating His greatness and bounty.
Bearing in mind what holidays and vacations mean to our general well-being, let us exercise our down-time wisely as we each year of U.S.A. holidays, either head out or from the comfort of home, trade places without GPS-s, high gas, or air travel pat downs. Do come along then, for a free ride down some of my winding roads of personal experiences." />
