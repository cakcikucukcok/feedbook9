  <title>Be Still the Dawn - Diann Farnsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day, God rested. God was still. In stillness, God blessed his creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 100:3 - Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked on a sandy beach searching for a perfect conch shell? The one you hold up to your ear to hear the relaxing ocean waves rolling to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without God, we would not have pebbles and stepping stones to trod, nor beautiful seashells to seek and find. God placed his love in the sand, in the seas, in the skies, in valleys, in mountainsEverywhere. Do you sense Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Still the Dawn takes you on a journey to feel and know Gods presence. Through poetic devotions, you are invited to be still and hear Gods calling. His whispers are as sweet and soothing as the wonderful message heard inside a conch shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be still and know Jesus. He is with you in your hurting and happy place. That place is all one in the same; it just feels different at different times. Let Jesus dwell in your heart as you experience your gift of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Still the Dawn also invites you to be still and to know yourself and others more deeply. It instills principles of faith, hope, and love to improve your quality of life and relationships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to be still and take an inspirational journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspirational. Motivational. Poetic.&lt;br /&gt;
Making Choices in Gods Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;
Experiencing Growth in Green Pastures and Still Waters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
