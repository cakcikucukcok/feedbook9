  <title>Making of a Poet - Deidre Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Making of a Poet strikes a chord in all of us who enjoy writingand readinglanguage which lifts our thoughts to dreams and hopes beyond the humdrum reality of life. When Deidre signed into a poetry course in junior high school, she found her perceptions and imaginings awakened to realms that widened her world to new enjoyment.
Teachers and experiences in high school and college increased her appreciation of life and the world and friends about her. Recognition came in 1980 when Self-Acceptance appeared in Eddie Lou Coles
World Treasury of Great Poems, which also included Time to Dream by her aunt Olive Jean Hope. Deidres verses have also appeared in Our Western Worlds Greatest Poems (1983), Best-Loved
Contemporary Poems (1979), The Dawn of Inspiration (1999), and Our Twentieth Centurys
Greatest Poems (1982).
Deidre continues to share life and inspiration with friends in The Poetry Circle of writers near her home in northern California. Her story can be your story too." />
