  <title>A Writer and a Fighter - Paula Denise Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Writer and A Fighter by Paula Denise Johnson is a collection of poems that pierce the heart and cause reflection and self evaluation. The writer pours out her soul throughout the pages of this book, deftly handling issues from abortion and baby momma drama to love for God and fufilling ones purpose. Her work speaks of experience from the school of hard knocks, yet is inspiring rather than bitter. This work of art is a portrait of resilience. With some of the same compassion, strength and sadness as poet, Maya Angelou, Johnsons writing leaps
from the pages and caresses readers hearts and moves one to tears. Her readers are sure to appreciate her sincerity and determination. Anyone who has ever struggled in life will find something that resonates within their spirit. Johnson gives readers a glimpse of her inner psyche as she demonstrates unequivocally her true calling. Furthermore, through her own journey of self-discovery, she encourages readers to find their true selves and fulfill their own calling. What Mary J. Blige is to music, Paula Denise Johnson is to poetry." />
