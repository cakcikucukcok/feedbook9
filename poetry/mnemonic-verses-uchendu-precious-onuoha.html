  <title>Mnemonic Verses - Uchendu Precious Onuoha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Despite mans victories in battle fields, exploits, and accomplishments in science and technology to conquer and dominate his world, death remain an eternal foe and mankinds worst enemy. And an event that remain strange to man. All things human are transitory and must cease or come to an end one day or another. Many people feel scared to talk or hear about death. But you cannot talk about life without death as they are co- travelers, two extremes, two strange bed fellows and un-identical twins they are. Where one ends, another begins. In Mnemonic Verses, the author considers death a major worthwhile subject among other topics, and something of much interest to ruminate our thoughts. Because, without being conscious of death, you cannot be fully cognizant or appreciative of the gift of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not just about living and dying. But before we came to where we are now and before we leave the stage, do we recall how we came to the world? In Hard to Forget, the author evokes the means through which humans come to the world and remembers his mothers love and care. Have you ever fallen in love and felt let down? Torments About Love, talks about the agony and pains of being rejected by a lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the life and history of every nation, there is a significant event that happens in a generation. Historic Declaration, is a major event that happened in the authors country which the effects are still plaguing the nation till today. Mnemonic Verses is a window that opens to the reader to various life issues as he opens the book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
