  <title>Citrus &amp; Green - Tim Bellows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I HAVE BET EVERYTHING -
my life, my life      
on this drifting blue, this
one-note sound of burning-silver flute that 
calls along nerve passageways, 
calls through my atoms like 
birds of a kind, shifting,
poised in a sky of tears, calculations, 
laughter, remembered days.
                                                     ~ Tim Bellows

A Note by Allegra Jostad Silberstein,
       Poet Laureate for the city of Davis, CA 2010-2012:
&quot;In Tim Bellows poems, we find a singular brightnessand a willingness to bet his life on the &#39;one-note sound of burning silver flute.&#39;  His work ranges from tender spirituality to embracing plants,  soil and stone.  In spite of occasional &#39;turquoise confusions,&#39; he is willing to risk all to explain the inexplicable. Exploring the musical voice of this poet brings unexpected rewards.&quot;
                                            *
Allegra Jostad Silberstein grew up on a Wisconsin farm and then moved to California in 1963.  Her love of poetry began as a child when her mother would recite poems as she worked.  In addition to three chapbooks, Silberstein is widely published in journals and is the first Poet Laureate of Davis." />
