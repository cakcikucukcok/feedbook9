  <title>A G. I. In America - Doug Rawlings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Poetry is meant to summarize universal feelings. Doug Rawlings&#39; poems capture beautifully the revulsion to war and the spirit of those who work for peace.&quot; - Ann Wright, US Army Reserve Colonel (ret) and former US diplomat.   &quot;Rawlings has written powerfully about the different facets of the veteran&#39;s experience. His poems will be cathartic to some and revealing to others. Perhaps they will be most revealing to those who hang around veterans and who have trouble understanding.&quot; - Dr. Jon Oplinger, Vietnam Veteran and author of Quang Tri Cadence: Memoir of a Rifle Platoon Leader in the Mountains of Vietnam.   &quot;Doug&#39;s poems communicate strength and clarity, pain, moral injury, gentleness, struggle. And always honesty. These poems are faithful companions to anyone who has been part of the veterans&#39; experience - and in one way or another, that&#39;s every one of us.&quot; - Chuck Searcy, Vietnam Veteran and Director of Project RENEW." />
