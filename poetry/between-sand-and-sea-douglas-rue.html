  <title>Between Sand and Sea - Douglas Rue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Between Sand and Sea is a patchwork of small mismatched pieces (memories) of actual daily journal entries masked in metaphors and poetry as Douglas finds his own way to recover from the harshness of a love lost along his lifes journey. To a greater sense, it serves as his personal forum, his therapy, as he reopens old wounds and takes a second look at a past love affair only to discover post mortem what love really means to him. This book is filled with his inner most intimacy, his cryptic pain and his desperate need to hold on to what he earned and lost some time ago. As well, it serves as his strength as he heals those past wounds only to discover a new love and how wonderful the feeling in finding a new beginning. Much a metaphor to life, Douglas learns how to maneuver through the harshness of life as he finds himself always somewhere between the sand and sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book serves as a sequel to Sunflowers: A Collection of Poems. Between Sand and Sea largely picks up to the woven words where Douglas left off in his first book. Here, he finds and adds missing poems. Here, he finds himself logging over memories, jumping back and forth, from a past relationship to his most recent, ultimately discovering his past insecurities still rest against the darkness of his shadows, as equally, his personal evolution, growth and maturity in creating and maintaining a new relationship. He finds himself reflecting in hot steamy passionate moments, restlessness, jealousness; impatience and eventually finding that place where sacrifice ultimately leading to completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each poem takes the reader into the day after, not knowing if the next poem is full of life, positivity or sadness resting on the pain of melancholy. Much fashioned after life, we all hope the next page is filled with happiness and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
