&lt;br&gt;Never Too Late for Loving&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Book Review: Secret Whispers&lt;br&gt;
Author, Heidy Ramos
Reviewed by Cynthia Brian
Heidy Ramoss poetic side was awakened after her divorce from husband number three. Having grown up in utter poverty in Mactan, Lapu, Lapu City in the Philippines, Heidy did not witness happy, loving relationships in her family. She and her siblings were abandoned by her mother, never knew their family, and lived in fear throughout her childhood.
Her small book of poetry, Secret Whispers, is a testament to her love of life, family, and relationships. Her native language is Tagalog, although she writes in English. There are grammatical and editorial errors in this volume because during the publishing process Ms. Ramos was ill. She is redesigning this lovely book from the heart and correcting any of the errors.
Secret Whispers is a great gift for anyone in love. Dip into the warm waters of the Philippines and enjoy the innocence, the beauty, and the passion of a beautiful woman of courage and bravery. Its never too late to have a happy life, to live and love in magnificence. Heidy shows us the way.

The book is available at her web site.

(REAL NAME)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This review is from: Secret Whispers (Paperback)
Heidy writes poetry from the heart, influenced by her experiences as a child growing up in the Philippines. I will admit, I am from the &quot;old school&quot; of rhyming poetry, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The works are full of hope, joy, sadness, pathos, all number of emotions based on personal experience. I know Heidy from a writers group in Upstate New York, and she is truly a genuine and nice person, and this is reflected in her writings." />
