      <meta name="description" content="&quot;...Unfortunately everything that I wrote before high school was lost with time. But I did manage to save a fair collection of pieces from high school and college days. Aside from my poems book from high school, it wasnt till 2010(and thanks to Facebook) that I actually started taking my poems off the scraps of paper I scribbled them on and put them where I can save them. Then one day I noticed I had a significant number of poems and got the idea to make a book. I selected the ones I wanted to share and compiled them here.&quot;" />
