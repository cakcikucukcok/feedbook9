  <title>Petals from the Rose of My Heart - Laurel Mae Compton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world full of pretense and confusion, a certain feeling of loneliness settles after a days living. Author Laurel Mae Compton offers an emotional shot in the arm as she provides a boost of encouragement and a refreshing point of view to life in her debut book titled Petals from the Rose of My Heart.  
Radiating hopefulness in these tumultuous times, Compton believes that everyone needs a little motivating push from time to time. She shares her faith and beliefs aiming to exude positivity in this inspiring collection as she brings together more than 30 of her inimitable poems capable of changing ones disposition and outlook in life. She uses her exceptional craftsmanship in the realm of poetry to enthuse people who are down and disheartened and offer them a little lift in her new book.
Brimming with invigorating and revealing poems, this book is tangible proof to the authors talent in masterfully interlacing words and rhymes to generate a kick-starting mood on the road to the brighter side of living. With thought-provoking lines and verses, it commemorates major traditions in Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Joy as it celebrates simple, unforgettable events as Happy Mothers Day and April Morning. It showcases apothegmatic pieces as sung in Stand in the Circle of Love, God is Always the Answer and I am Gods Radiant Child, creating a poignant reminder that good things are attainable by keeping the hopes up and trusting the Almighty Father above.
The authors poems have been recognized in Young America Sings in 1945, National Library of Poetry from 1993 to 1997, with Angels Kiss, O Soul of Mine Rise Up and The Gift included in the Best Poems Publication in 1995, 1996 and 1997 respectively.
In this enlightening anthology, readers are redirected to what is truly essential in life with the remarkable words of wisdom palpable from page to page. Pregnant with faith, love and joy, Petals from the Rose of My Heart plunges into the depths and realities of existence as it draws readers to a closer relationship with God." />
