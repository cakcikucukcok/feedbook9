      <meta name="description" content="If you don&#39;t see this life as a straight line that ends, you may see it as a series of cycles that never end. A short one might be a day. The sun rises and the sun sets, the sun rises and the sun sets, and so on. A long one might be the cycle of addiction. Use, recovery, relapse, use, recovery, and so on. I have completed many cycles in this life and have laid a lot of things to rest. The poems in this book tell my story in rhymes. Some are short and some are connected to make stories. These poems have helped a lot of people struggling with depression and addiction, and I hope that they may bring some light into your life." />
