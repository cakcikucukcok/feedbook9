  <title>Song of a Baby (Poetry) - Lucky James Evbouan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Song of a Baby is a collection of poems which gently weave through everyday life- people, places, nature, reminiscences and reflections. Each poem is beautiful as it is affective; the message is distinct and unconfused.
In a sense, some of the poems contained in this volume are versified prose telling short stories, but with rhythm. Although rhymes may be considered pedestrian in some quarters, they nonetheless retain a quality so rare in other forms of writing. Song of a Baby features a couple of rhymes which have been carefully strung for your delight.
A baby is the object of a mothers love. Yet, in its innocence, it conceives to teach Mother about love. Song of a Baby may well be likened to thoughts of a baby in the way it modestly seeks to share passionate expressions with an already well-versed world." />
