  <title>The Collected Poems of Hafiz - Hafiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hafiz was a Persian lyric poet (1315/17-1390) whose collected works, or &quot;Divan&quot;, are as sacred to most Iranians as the Qur&#39;an. He was highly acclaimed during his lifetime, and is by far the most popular poet in Iran, where they celebrate Hafiz Day on October 12. Although he was influenced by Islam, Hafiz is widely respected by Hindus, Christians and others for his beautiful turn of a phrase and for his regard of the universal soul. &quot;The Collected Poems of Hafiz&quot; touch on themes of love, faith and exposing hypocrisy, and many people find personal guidance within its pages. Since Hafiz&#39; work was first translated into English in 1771, scholars in the Western world have been conflicted between literal and mystical interpretations of the poems. Nevertheless, they provide fascinating details on life and culture in Persia, and to some, it brings valuable insight toward mysticism and the ineffable." />
