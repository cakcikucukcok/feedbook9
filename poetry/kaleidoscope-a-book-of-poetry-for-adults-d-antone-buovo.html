  <title>Kaleidoscope: A Book of Poetry for Adults - D’Antone Buovo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time is running out. Hold me tight.  The clock ticks its last. Hold me fast.  Oh, would I could fly on gossamer wing  To the universe of eternal life.  There to be pleased, while angels sing.  But I am homo sapien:  (Able to know right from wrong)  I, alone, pay for my own sin.   D&#39;Antone Buovo has always loved God first and women second. Now in the third act of his long life, Buovo shares a remarkable, lyrical journey into the mind of a sagacious and tired old soul.   Buovo relies on his diverse life experiences while exploring a wide range of human emotions. In his poems, Buovo provides a glimpse into his varied experiences with romantic love, lust, loss, betrayal, longing, and spiritual devotion through playful narratives, verse that reflects life lessons, and meaningful dialogue with God.   Kaleidoscope shares one man&#39;s viewpoint of his world and beyond as he reflects on his life, love, and betrayal." />
