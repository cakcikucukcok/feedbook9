  <title>Uncle Will’S Hail Town - Wilbur Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My work speaks to questions, mens ways, the people, places of lands, power positions, lies, wars, slavery, hate to a point of killing!
The trail of tearsthe indians were willing to share through an equal process the land products! Slavery to work the land taken from the indian slaves and blacks became one, slavery to death that cannot be right! To the so-called christian soul, the wars are to die and fight on the wrong side of history.
My work speaks to the fear of skin color. How sad and sick must be our minds! We can see one soul in the environment and another person in their environment! Its just one big lie that keeps the warmth of the sun out of our lives!
My work carry you one way but lets you go another way! In 1914 was the war to end all war. We see how that worked out; we have the same old sin. You may give an answer or not. My work is to make one think or not be seen, just maybe of the million books out.
My work speak out when a person loves a dog better than a man. When a man because of skin cannot just walk his dog, his dog, kill the man save the dog." />
