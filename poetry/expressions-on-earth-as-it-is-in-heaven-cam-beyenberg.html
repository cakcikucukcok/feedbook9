  <title>Expressions on Earth, as It Is in Heaven - Cam Beyenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Expressions on eARTh, as It Is in Heaven is a collection of the poetry, creative writing, and songs by Cameron Beyenberg. It is an attempt at connecting the heart of the Creator with the hearts of Creation. It is a dream of stirring all to a deeper relationship with Christ Jesus, leading to greater creativity and artistic expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart beat of this book is to inspire and empower Christians to walk out their callings as Gods Beloved Children in all the creative ways possible. The hope is that it will stir faithful and obedient love that blesses those who are not even thought to be blessed. The author hopes that readers may be released into the fullness of Gods creative love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron has the unique ability to take the often unutterable and spiritually grand words of our life and put them on the page for us to observe the language of our hearts. This is a triumphant work of bringing both spiritual and biblical truths into direct alignment with powerfully intimate creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Fraser Venter, MDiv, Lead Pastor at Cucamonga Christian Fellowship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron is a deep thinker; he writes through the kingdom lenses of grace, mercy, and scandalous love, giving practical insights from his lifes experiences. The poetic songs and writings will draw you right into the very presence of the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dave Collins, Wagner Leadership Institute, Claremont Healing Rooms&lt;/p&gt;" />
