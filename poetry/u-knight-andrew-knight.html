  <title>U-Knight - Andrew Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of poetry, Knight canvasses the sphere of human existence, from the meaning of love, vulnerability, joy, hope and recovery.  The unforgiving forces demanding your surrender are defeated and the hope, vision and celebration of a positive future are embraced and provide the motivation to become the ideal self.  In a sensitive, yet evocative style, Knight captures the essence of being humanhow we are at times, compelled to live within mystery as long as it feels right. In his poetry, Knight reveals the challenges of aging, the power of relationships to unite lovers and enable others to find a common ground.  Glimpses of existentialism weave through the work and reveal how individuals pursue meaning, despite acknowledging how freedom of choice and responsibility can undermine our pursuit for meaning and clarity in life." />
