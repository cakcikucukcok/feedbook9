      <meta name="description" content="Do you wonder what it is like to be a baby Christian, with all the roller coaster ups &amp; downs of Life?  We All have different ideas of what God is like &amp; many times we get the wrong Image of Him.  A distorted view, you might say, because of our up-bringing.  Little do we realize that He is watching over us, seeing us through all of those storms of life.  Waiting on us to surrender our self to Him so He can bring JOY into our lives &amp; heal our wounded hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Or, perhaps you are not a Christian at all &amp; are seeking to know how to become one!  Well, wonder no more, my friends, for in this Book, you can find the right Image of God, through His beloved Son, JESUS!  You know, The One Who came as a Babe in a Manger &amp; gave His very Life on a cruel cross of shame to Ransom you from Eternal separation from God. WHY? Because: He LOVES YOU!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
