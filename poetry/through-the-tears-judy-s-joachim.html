  <title>Through the Tears - Judy S. Joachim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Judy Joachim&#39;s husband of 32 years suddenly died, she found herself thrust into a world of deep loss filled with unfamiliar and painful emotions and thoughts that accompany the loss of a loved one. Everything she had known for her entire adult life was suddenly different and forever changed. Her journey began with first writing a poem to be read at the funeral and grew into a series of poems encompassing every emotion that exploded from her pain.
This book is not only personal and dedicated to her beloved husband, but it is also a true account of her journey through the process of grief. It is at times gut-wrenching, expressing the true emotion of sadness and pain, while at other times uplifting and joyous. This book expresses the entire spectrum of emotions many experience Through the Tears, yet few can put into words." />
