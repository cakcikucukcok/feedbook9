  <title>The Power of Love - Karin M. Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My book is Holy Spirit inspired, prompting me on a journey from conflict to peace. Every psalm and poem reflects my inner most experiences through my turbulent life including many failures and triumphs. God has proven to me time and time again that His love, strength, and wisdom is present in every aspect of my life. He gave me hope when I had none. Jesus helped me start over and cast my burdens onto Him. The life I lead was long and hard and some of these psalms and poems tell my story of pain, loss, failure, and acceptance, giving me a much needed hard look at myself to make a drastic change in my life. I continue to face challenges on this journey being prompted by the Holy Spirit to excel and not lose faith, and He has opened my eyes and helped me to accept, forgive, repent, and share my experiences. I still have many weak moments, but Jesus shows me that in holding fast through faith He will never leave me. No matter how hard life gets or how long my journey is, until Im called home, Jesuss love will never fail me.&lt;/p&gt;" />
