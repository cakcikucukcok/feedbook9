  <title>Patterns in Henna - Marguerite Thoburn Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The three sections in &lt;i&gt;Patterns in Henna&lt;/i&gt; contain poems from three parts of my life; most of the first two sections are set in British India in the thirties, forties, or earlier, an era and place gone forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The poems in Section I are impressions from childhood with the point of view of a child or adolescent and reflect attitudes of the time.  &lt;br&gt;
Section II is about my father and his family. It is because of them that I spent my formative years in India.  Many poems are based on family stories. &lt;br&gt;
In Section III, I write in my adult voice about return trips to India and then move on to a group of more reflective poems. &lt;br&gt;
I give a poem from each section as an example.  I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed writing them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;I. &lt;br&gt;
   Under the Gul Mohur Tree&lt;br&gt;
   (Jabalpur, Central India) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   A gul mohur tree dominated our back garden. &lt;br&gt;
   Sun dappled through a thousand fern-like fronds, &lt;br&gt;
   the series of planes like Nepalese temple rooftops. &lt;br&gt;
   Here Chutan, the cook, fattened ducks, &lt;br&gt;
   and a goose for Christmas, &lt;br&gt;
   the former foragers resting like pashas in the green-gold shade, &lt;br&gt;
   slurping fresh water, eating handfuls of fine wheat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Chutan prized the delicate spring leaves, pale yellow, &lt;br&gt;
   humbly approached my father, &lt;br&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&quot;Huzoor,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; hands pressed together, &lt;br&gt;
   for permission to pick a few. &lt;br&gt;
   His wife prepared the tight-curled fronds &lt;br&gt;
   with wild coriander to make &lt;i&gt;sabzi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.
   Racemes of flowers appeared with the hot weather, &lt;br&gt;
   resting above the foliage. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;   Gul mohur&lt;/i&gt;--rose peacock-- the Peacock-rose, &lt;br&gt;
   gold mohur, I called it as a child, &lt;br&gt;
   each blossom a shining gold, &lt;br&gt;
   igniting into orange, vermilion, scarlet. &lt;br&gt;
   Bright Indian sun sparkled &lt;br&gt;
   through airy shadows shifting over leaf-strewn earth&lt;br&gt;
   and the abandoned well, &lt;br&gt;
   deep enough for drowning. &lt;br&gt;
   White ants riddled the massive cover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Once throbbing with a three-day headache, &lt;br&gt;
   (my mother blamed the Indian sun), &lt;br&gt;
   I pulled a mat under the gul mohur. &lt;br&gt;
   Air currents brushed leaf ribs, &lt;br&gt;
   waved pink-gold shapes through eyelids, &lt;br&gt;
   and I listened to insects, &lt;br&gt;
   then my father&#39;s footfall in dry grass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   He sat beside me, &lt;br&gt;
   coming between his classes&lt;br&gt;
   to sit quietly on the lip of the well&lt;br&gt;
   and press a wet towel on my forehead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;II. &lt;br&gt;
   Calling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   A lammergeyer vulture &lt;br&gt;
   circled cloudless Indian sky&lt;br&gt;
   and from the lazy pattern&lt;br&gt;
   there dropped a single feather&lt;br&gt;
   veering in concentric whorls&lt;br&gt;
   until it dropped almost by&lt;br&gt;
   the hand of a young preacher&lt;br&gt;
   pondering his messages. &lt;br&gt;
   He fingered the stout quill, &lt;br&gt;
   gripped it firmly like a pen, &lt;br&gt;
   whittled a point.  Having come &lt;br&gt;
   so far, started a letter&lt;br&gt;
   to his sister half a world &lt;br&gt;
   away on a Midwest farm. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;   Dear Isabella,&lt;/i&gt; he wrote, &lt;br&gt;
   then wondered what he could say. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;   Indian women do not learn&lt;br&gt;
   with their brothers as you did. &lt;br&gt;
   Their faces veiled, eyes cast down, &lt;br&gt;
   knowing nothing of the world, &lt;br&gt;
   they cry for teachers like you.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   A mustard seed dropped in loam&lt;br&gt;
  springs into a tree.  To his&lt;br&gt;
   surprise a letter arrived. &lt;br&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;I come when the way opens. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   When the heart is ready, doors&lt;br&gt;
   swing back, as they did for her, &lt;br&gt; 
   founding a womans college. &lt;br&gt;
   With unruly locks confined &lt;br&gt;
   beneath a deaconess cap, &lt;br&gt;
   and full figure cased in black, &lt;br&gt;
   her life filled up with color&lt;br&gt;
   and generations of girls&lt;br&gt;
   from Lucknow, kingdom of Oudh.                                               &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
