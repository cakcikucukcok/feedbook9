  <title>Truth and Glory - Charla Clay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is about inspirational spiritual poetry. It is used to encourage self-worth and self-esteem. It is made to help people understand how to manage with life when times are hard and frustrating. When your future doesnt seem clear they are made to help you find your way. They edify and build strength in despair. They inspire you to never give up and life is never a mistake. It takes all kinds of people to make the world an exciting place. You should always stand out and be counted. As a human race we should not be judged as imperfect in the eyes of man. We are perfect as god made us. Reproving self only causes us to not be whole and compromise existence. With this attitude no one will never measure up. It is time out for the human race to stop beating up on self and others and enlighten who we are as Gods creation." />
