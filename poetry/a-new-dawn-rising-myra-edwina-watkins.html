  <title>A New Dawn Rising - Myra Edwina Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I settled onto this title as a breaking forth from the darkness that has captured me in different stages of
my life.
As I peer into the darkness of night, as the fears, tears and insecurities engulf me. There were some dark
times.
I hold onto the hopes and dreams and aspirations of tomorrow. I eagerly await the birth of a new day. As
the light begins to get brighter and brighter, my heart begins to be overwhelmed, as I witness a new day
and a new beginning.
Waking up to the start of a new day with new adventures and a new outlook and new feelings. All captivating
and exciting. A wonderment with a new vision. As the dawn rises, it brings a feeling of satisfaction and
comfort. A warmth from deep within.
As the new dawn rises it gives me a sense of appreciation of life. With that in my mind, comes love, joy and
peace from the creator that made it all possible.
This title and these writings will in itself express my feelings in different ways. I feel many people will relate
to these various expressions that is written on these pages.
My hope is that as I share these times and many feelings, that it can touch the hearts and minds of others,
so that in time, they can look forward to the day when a New Dawn will rise in their lives as well.
Good Reading To You All.." />
