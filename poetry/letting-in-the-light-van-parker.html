  <title>Letting in the Light - Van Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letting in the Light is a book of poems, all of which I wrote between the ages of eighty and eighty-six.  They seemed to emerge naturally, both from when I was forty-one years in the active ministry and from reflections and writings during retirement.
You might say that poetry finally found me and has become the best way I know of putting into words some things Ive begun to learn. Writing poems has opened up the world in ways I hadnt expected. Its made me aware of connections to other people and to the earth, which is truly our mother.
 Letting in the Light is a book about discovering the holy in the ordinary, everyday experiences that come to all of us. Some have described my poems as accessible. I hope those who read them will find them of some help. They are offered by a fellow journeyer." />
