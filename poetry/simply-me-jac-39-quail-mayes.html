  <title>&quot;Simply Me&quot; - Jac&#39;Quail Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simply Me is an exterior look at the positive change and growth that happens as a person matures and learns how to allow lifes struggles, personal battles, and lessons become a testimony of triumph.  This volume of poetry is sure to fortify the faith and strength of others and will also allow them to read and experience the dynamic run off the page poetry that has been delivered.  From love and intimate thoughts, to hardship and life revelations, Simply Me shares these thoughts across every page. 
As God continues to work in my life I will continue to express and use the gifts of His love to encourage and empower others to discover their own gifts and use them to create positive forums.  Be poetically free in every aspect of your life and remember that the power of life and death is in the tongue, so always speak and invoke life.
