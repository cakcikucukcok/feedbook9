  <title>Love, Lust, and Loss - Claudacious Shakespeare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My poetry and short stories will take you on a journey and give you a brief look into my life. Everything I write is from the heart and is inspired by personal experiences. Love speaks of the love that has filled my heart. Lust speaks of the many temptations, seductions, and emotions that stimulate the body. And loss speaks of the hurt that can be brought on by love or feelings of lack thereof. 
The short stories of passion allowed me to delve into my creative side. The many days I sat daydreaming and wondering what if are now out of my head and on paper. Often we fantasize but we keep our fantasies to ourselves. This allows me to explore those passions outside of a mere daydream. 
Love, Lust, and Loss reflects life experiences and everything in between. My book takes a look into every aspect of every emotion that love and loss of love elicits. I hope that what I write inspires you to feel something youve never felt, reminds you of a love from your past, present, or future, and allows you to see that you are not alone in your emotions." />
