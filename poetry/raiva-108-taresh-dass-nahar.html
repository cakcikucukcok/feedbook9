  <title>Raiva 108 - Taresh Dass Nahar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the last twenty years my passion has been to study religions and spirituality. I have read and studied the origins of Hinduism, Bhudism and Sikhism otherwise known as Sanatan Dharam and studied the Bible and the Koran a number of times.
Manjulika Singh a yoga master and myself have been doing a radio program on Universal and Eternal Spirituality ie Divine Love, for about ten years, with Awazfm 107.2.  This program goes live on air every Saturday mornings between 8-9am.
My other activities include working with different communities for over the last twenty years. Building bridges of understanding to remove barriers of dogmatic ignorance, that prevent us from getting on with each other. My profession was as a teacher of Design and Technology in Secondary Education for over twenty years.
The poetry in this book reflects my understanding of Divine Loves Universal and Eternal manifestation as ideal ethics and morals that should be practised by man on the path of true righteousness.  Practice of the will of God is very basic and yet very difficult to implement, I am no exception." />
