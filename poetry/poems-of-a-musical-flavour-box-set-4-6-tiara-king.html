  <title>Poems Of A Musical Flavour: Box Set 4-6 - Tiara King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Music artists were in my life, and I started to analyse lyrics, which I guess led me to analyse books&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Little did I know over the seven and a bit years I wrote that it was setting me up for bigger and better scribblings, namely novels over 500 pages and 125,000 words, and novellas, short stories and non-fictions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time 2002 rolled around, I was 28 years old and wrote one song. That&amp;rsquo;s all I wrote. And I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I wrote that because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t written in six years. That was the last song, and all of them were my practice for story-telling in four verses, a chorus, and a bridge for much bigger and better things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Covering a wide range of topics from 1993-2002, or volumes 4-6, mostly love, I plagiarise myself a lot, so have a good laugh, especially over the witty one-liners and anecdotes about what was happening, who I wanted to be, or who I had a crush on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are not perfect, nor meant to be; they&amp;rsquo;re just the musings of a young teenage girl with crushes and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!" />
