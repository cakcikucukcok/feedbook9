  <title>Endured - Veera S</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Endured. The book can be called a mixed bouquet or an anthology of poems written over a span of several years. The collection is a mix of styles, genres and is reflective as most poems are about human sentiment and circumstance. Since the collection has been written over several years, the spectrum is a bit broad. The author has touched upon various themes and verse styles. The reader may find it interesting to note that the language too, ranges from the classic to the contemporary. 
Poetry generally is defined as,  A spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. The skill of a poet is to express inner reflections in a condensed contrite form, but nevertheless in a manner so as to make the reading experience enjoyable and appealing. This collection hopes to accomplish that. 
True connoisseurs of the English language may appreciate the diversity which has been used intentionally in this collection. This book is an extension of the authors complete love for the poetic form in literature. While a number of the poems within, have stemmed from sentiments of anguish, love and loss, a vast number are just creative outpourings. The intent of this book is to share the authors passion with like minded readers and perhaps connect with them on a personal plane." />
