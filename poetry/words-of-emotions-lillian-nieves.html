  <title>Words of Emotions - Lillian Nieves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ive been writing poems since I was a little girl. I saved a lot of them, and I lost many, but Im here today to start my book of poems. The cover of my book is a lily flower with tears falling down from all the heartache and struggle Ive been through in life. My nephew, Jonathan Jarvis, age twelve, drew my picture for my book, so I want to thank him for his talent and pray for him to keep doing an excellent job on his artwork. I have my children to share my life with, and I am very proud of them. I have learned a lot being in my last relationship of ten years. It was exciting, and I enjoyed the ride. There are things in life that need change, and sometimes you have to let go and move on because you feel some things are holding you back, and thats what I did. My poems are all from life experience, and I put all my feelings into them. I wish myself luck with my book and success. I want to thank everyone that supported me through good and bad times and believed in me. Lillian Nieves" />
