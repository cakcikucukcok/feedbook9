  <title>Cries and Whispers - Chrys Chryssanthou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is an anthology of poems. Most of them were originally written in English, some, however, were written in Greek. The author translated all of them, so that each poem appears in both English and Greek. The poems reflect personal impressions and experiences of the author from his long and fascinating life in the United States and Greece. They express his deeper thoughts and feelings, his dreams and visions, his anxieties and his hopes. They are emotional, dramatic and often philosophical. The poems cover a broad spectrum of subjects from family, romance and sex, to war, tragedy and illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What people say&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Cries &amp; Whispers makes one shiver. &lt;br&gt;
Dr. Chryssanthous poems reveal the human condition, both the good and the awful, and encapsulate moments of sadness, quiet joy, love and humanity  the cries and whispers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
