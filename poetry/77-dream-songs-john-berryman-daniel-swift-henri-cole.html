  <title>77 Dream Songs - John Berryman, Daniel Swift, Henri Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wild, masterful Pulitzer Prize-winning cycle of poems that half a century later still shocks and astounds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Berryman was hardly unknown when he published &lt;i&gt;77 Dream Songs&lt;/i&gt;,  but the volume was, nevertheless, a shock and a revelation. A &quot;spooky&quot;  collection in the words of Robert Lowell-&quot;a maddening work of genius.&quot;&lt;br&gt;      As Henri Cole notes in his elegant, perceptive introduction,  Berryman had discovered &quot;a looser style that mixed high and low dictions  with a strange syntax.&quot; Berryman had also discovered his most enduring  alter ego, a paranoid, passionate, depressed, drunk, irrepressible  antihero named Henry or, sometimes, Mr. Bones: &quot;We touch at certain  points,&quot; Berryman claimed, of Henry, &quot;But I am an actual human being.&quot;&lt;br&gt;      Henry may not be real, but he comes alive on the page. And while  the most famous of the Dream Songs begins, &quot;Life, friends, is boring,&quot;  these poems never are. Henry lusts: seeing a woman &quot;Filling her compact  &amp; delicious body / with chicken páprika&quot; he can barely restrain  himself: &quot;only the fact of her husband &amp; four other people / kept me  from springing on her.&quot; Henry despairs: &quot;All the world like a woolen  lover / once did seem on Henry&#39;s side. / Then came a departure.&quot; Henry,  afraid of his own violent urges, consoles himself: &quot;Nobody is ever  missing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;77 Dream Songs&lt;/i&gt; won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965,  but Berryman&#39;s formal and emotional innovations-he cracks the language  open, creates a new idiom in which to express eternal feelings-remain as  alive and immediate today as ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
