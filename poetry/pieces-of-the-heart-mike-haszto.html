  <title>Pieces of the Heart - Mike Haszto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Emotions. Life. The saying goes that the eyes are the windows to your soul. Given that to be true, then I submit that life&#39;s experiences are the lifeline to the heart. For every experience, there is a new piece added to the heart. With each new experience, comes an emotion. Many come with&lt;EM&gt; emotions. &lt;/EM&gt;Many emotions are new, many are somewhat the same,yet independent of themselves. Each also carries varying degrees at which each emotion is felt...each experience a piece, of varying size, of the heart.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; And it&#39;s the culmination of those experiences that make up our heart. Which emotions do we feel strongest? Which emotions seem to control us? Which emotions make us weak. We all experience differently, create differently, and envision differently. We all have varying degrees of emotions, through our experiences and through our creativity and visions.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;This collection of experiences will take the reader into a past of memories, triggering thoughts and maybe a smile or two. This collection may take the reader into a present thought process, triggering experiences that readers may be encountering now. Finally, this collection will take the reader deep into thought about their visions of the future. This is a feel good collection of poems that will set the reader at ease, yet will delve into some deep emotions.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Enjoy!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
