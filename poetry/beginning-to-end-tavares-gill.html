  <title>Beginning to End - Tavares Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is my story. Some may call it a book; I call it my untold thoughts locked and stored. I feel that I am a voice for all the many voices all across this nation that is hidden underneath the tiniest surface. I feel as though I can uplift and give strength, hope, and comfort to the voices that are left behind and overlooked and once was told and still being told that nobody wants to hear your opinions and input. The reason I say that I am the voice because I was once and sometimes still am that voicethat lost voice, just like yours. I wrote these poems because no one would listen when I needed love. I felt like the only love I got was the lines on those sheets inside of my notebookthose blank sheets showed and gave me the love I needed and loved the right or the wrong me. It never judge or viewed me as a failure. This book is about my pain, my misunderstandings, and my mishaps. All the above, anything you want to be (dreamer). This is life in its truest form." />
