  <title>Dead Sea Scrolls - J.L. Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack was a sailor in the US Navy from 1974 until 1978.  At age twenty-two, while sailing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, he wrote poetry.  His poems rested on land, unread for thirty-eight years in an old cardboard box.  Out of Jack&#39;s sea chest comes a book of poetry that captures a historic cultural viewpoint of an American sailor at sea almost four decades ago. Jack&#39;s collection of poems reflects his observations on society during the 1960s.  Themes expressed include, war, death, fame, 1960s ideals, and nature&#39;s majesty. 
Imagine if you will a 22 year old sailor at sea with no axes to grind, and no agenda to meet, simply writing thoughts about his experience in society during the 1960&#39;s. A thousand miles out at sea with only ocean spray, windy breezes, and blue skies. At night, a billion stars light up the heavens. Candlelight provided from God to illuminate ones thoughts.  Your only companion out here is nature&#39;s presence. 
 In this setting innocent thoughts emerge that allow total freedom of expression without the hindrance of social approval or expectations of reward. A young mind expressing heartfelt thought  just capturing that inner voice that all humanity has. While listening to that inner thought, truth emerges. Pure truth that is hidden deep within each person&#39;s soul. That is the essence of the book.
With these thoughts in mind, I invite you to journey with me back in time and take a glimpse of society of the 1960s.  A time when youthful innocence and civil disobedience joined forces to create a consciousness so powerful that no force on earth could stop. The existing establishment could no longer govern by the rules of the past.
Discover some innocent truths buried and unread for decades in the darkness of an old cardboard box. View one perception of reality about society in the 1960s that was felt and expressed in simple verse.
