All my memories from childhood keep coming back while I wanted to rest. My inner voice is talking to me which made me decide to write words down. I decided to put them in writing for the others to relate to. That serves as an inspiration for me to write poems and come up with the title &quot;Mental and Spiritual Healing.&quot; 
I call it Mental and Spiritual Healing because mental serves as my reoccurring memories and spiritual came much later because the poems took a life of it&#39;s own. I just hope to reach one person with my words." />
