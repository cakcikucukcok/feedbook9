  <title>Betti’S Blog Beyond Stone - William David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a companion to Educating Stone. It is not a volume two or a sequel but a companion.  Both works of fiction stand-alone but if you first read Educating Stone this companion book will make a little more sense to you, particularly the sequels.  A few of Bettis favorite blogs from Educating Stone are re-presented for further enjoyment. 
In this second book of novel poetry I am using strike through as a means to display an alternative thought to a poem.  Perhaps the stricken line is presented as a subjectively better line or perhaps the stricken line may be the first thought but not the best thought.   Maybe the stricken line is the best way to write a second meaning to the poem so that the reader benefits from both meanings.  This is a novel poetry idea. not a mainstream idea.  The use of parentheses does not create the subtleness of meaning that I wish to convey to the reader.   There is one poem called Beige Love where the strike through conveys past, gone, removed: deleted.  
I also use emoticons J sparingly in just a few poems where I think it helps convey a thought.
The first set of books that I have written contains the novel:  Gunplay: Beauty Redeemed and the companion book of poetry:  Bettis Blog: Beyond Beauty Redeemed.   All four books feature Betti in her garden in Phoenix.  
Please note that all characters appearing in this work are fictitious.  Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead is purely coincidental.  All references to street addresses, phone numbers and websites are fictitious.  Any resemblances to any of these are purely coincidental. 
In addition to Bettis Blog, there are other poems of a wide range of subjects.  I hope that you enjoy Bettis Blog Beyond  Stone." />
