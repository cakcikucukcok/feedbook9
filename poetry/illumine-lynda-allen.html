  <title>Illumine - Lynda Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Illumine is Lynda Allen&amp;#39;s second collection of poetry. It is a celebration of the light within us all, as well as a chronicle of the journey Ms. Allen took in remembering the constancy of that light within herself. The words that move through Lynda speak directly to the heart, and inspire others to not only heed the call of their own heart, but also to embrace their journey, both the light and the dark, with joy and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poems in Illumine are accompanied by four photographs by award-winning photographer, Joyce Tenneson, found in her book &amp;quot;Intimacy,&amp;quot; a collection of photographs of flowers. Included in the volume are nine poems that were inspired by Tenneson&amp;rsquo;s work. Ms. Allen often finds inspiration and spiritual wisdom for her work through the beauty of nature, in this case as captured by Tenneson&amp;rsquo;s photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
