      <meta name="description" content="So I conclude that, first, there is nothing better for a man than to be happy and to enjoy himself as long as he can;  and second,  that he should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of his labors, for these are the gifts of God.
- Ecclesiastes 2:12
So I saw that they should be happy in their work, for that is what they are here for, and no one can bring them back to life to enjoy what will be in the future, so let them enjoy it now.
- Ecclesiastes 2:22
In response to all He has done for us, let us outdo each other in being helpful and kind to each other and in doing good.
			- Hebrews 10:24
So stop evaluating Christians by what the world thinks about them or by what they seem to be like on the outside.
			- 2 Corinthians 5:16
My constant boast is God; I can never thank you enough.
						- Psalm 44:8" />
