  <title>Elevate Yourself - Janet Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been written in sequence. First, I give an expressive view of life coming from a place of unhappiness. And I desired changes in all areas of my life. So the first five poems are coming from sadness. The poem that I used to give this message is called From Dark to Light, written in a menu format. From there on in each poem is how I view myself and others as worthwhile beings full of dreams and hopes. Aiding people is my inspired view; inspiring people is my lifelong goal, which I have accomplished. My wish is to see people develop and their potential shine through. This would be my biggest achievement. Please enjoy as you read as you become empowered." />
