  <title>Inquisitive Rhymes for Little Minds - Carol Puffenberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am Carol A. Puffenberger, turning seventy-three on March 30, 2017. I live in Stephens City, Virginia, about nine miles south of Winchester, Virginia. I have worked most of my life in the medical field. I just retired a few months ago from the laboratory. 
I love children, watching them grow and learn especially when they are young. I have three children, aged fifty-three, forty-seven, and forty-two. I have six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, all of which live within one hour from me. We have five generations of girls on the same side of the family. I take care of my mother who just turned ninety-three.
All of these poems in my little book tell a story. Children need to read, laugh, learn, and have fun and also to be nurtured and taught right from wrong starting very young at home. More reading, writing, and arithmetic should be taught in the schools and less time spent on electronics. Any child can learn, grow, prosper, and achieve their expectations starting very young with love, respect, and the correct support.
So please read these poems to your children, letting them ask questions and have imaginations in their minds. Let them dream, sleep, and playwaking up bright and fresh, ready to put another book in their hands to broaden their minds for the future and get close to reality." />
