  <title>Love Is Lust First - David Amadeus Panckeri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gabriel Garcia Marquez is right! Unrequited love is what moves the earth and the sky for me. And maybe for you.
	I hope not all of your love remains unrequited. To gain anything worthwhile in life, one has to risk much. This book is an autobiography which delves into the pain as well as the nobility of the pursuit of love which can only occur once in a lifetime. This book contains 55 poems, all of them springing from the deepest emotions of my life.
	This work centers on passion in its many guises, from love to lust. The purpose of this book is to demonstrate that there can be no limits to desire and no regrets unless a lover does not follow his/her heart. For the fortunate person whose love has been taken to the limits and then been fully reciprocated finally by a lover, this book might not make a lot of sense. To those of us who are still believers in finding our missing halves, I hope this book inspires. To those who have become discouraged, rejected, or too timid to listen to your hearts, I ask you to read this book and stay open to the possibility that your lover could walk into your life as early as the next minute. Your heart will tell you. Listen to your heart." />
