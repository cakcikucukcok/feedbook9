  <title>I Am Addict - Dennis Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In here is an offering. An offering designed to enlighten and inspire anyone who is on the less traveled road laid out by the 12 steps of recovery. I say less traveled because the numbers of true recoverees is relatively small in comparison to the numbers of people caught in addictions. This collection has been many, many years in the making. I hope that it may bring some light and maybe a little humor to a relatively dark subject.
I have tried not to offend sensitive eyes and pallets but there is some language used in the cramped world of users that works when other language doesn&#39;t, and some of it is in this collection. I have refrained from vulgarity however and if you can tolerate some compromise I am sure you will be pleasantly rewarded. 
If you are new to recovery you may be surprised at some of the things here that you thought no one else had ever thought.
It is important to remember that the common thread in addiction is the lie that you are the only one who has ever done the things you are doing. There is only so much dysfunction in the world, and when you have been on the road of recovery for a while it becomes amazingly redundant. Everybody is stunned to find out they are not alone in their weirdness. Stunned and then relieved to find out that there is a way out.
The bottom line is that we give up a life of using for a life of service. When you find this and come to terms with serving people who usually don&#39;t care, and you serve them anyway, then and only then will you start receiving the rewards that await you." />
