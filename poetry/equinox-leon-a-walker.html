  <title>Equinox - Leon A. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Equinox &lt;br&gt;
Chronicles from the Archives of Life&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Equinox is a beautifully written, yet stunning revelation of life that is presented without reservations or boundaries. The third collection of short stories and poetry by Leon A. Walker, it is most certainly his most compelling and comprehensive work. This book is somewhat of an anthology as it contains written works from his first two collections as well as many new poems and short stories that were written in recent years and some, specifically for this project. 
Readers of Equinox will be moved by many of the sensitive themes as well as the creative and classic style that is so masterfully employed by this writer. A style that has become the signature aspect of his personal literary flair. As a poet, he is widely recognized for his ability to weave passion and emotion into his works. A talent that many believe sets him apart from many modern-day writers, through his brilliant and captivating use of word blends and his meticulous sense of rhythm and tempo.
Equinox is a marvelous collection of short stories and poetry that any collector or reader or creative writing or classic literature would vastly appreciate.
