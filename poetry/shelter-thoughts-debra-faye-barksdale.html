  <title>Shelter Thoughts - Debra Faye Barksdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you are feeling low, reach out for the Lord.
This is a collection of poems from me to you. These are poems to inspire and lift your spirits. They were written in the dark of night and in the early morning light and written from the heart full of emotion. This collection of poems is to offer inspiration and motivation to those that are feeling low. The Lord will speak to us when we least expect it. Listen carefully with your heart, and he will provide light in the darkest of times. 
These poems were written throughout different seasons of the year and seasons of life. These poems were written with life and heart, full of tears and even laughter. Life is too short to be burdened with worry and dread. Let the inspiration fill you and warm your soul. Let the Lord inspire you and fill your heart with warmth, dreams, and love." />
