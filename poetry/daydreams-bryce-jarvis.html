I would like to thank those four people especially for pushing me daily to start writing again. I never knew how much other people would like my poetry until all of you came along, thank you. I also extend my thanks to all the others that compelled me to think outside of the box. I would be honored to also thank Bob, whose bright colors made my day and gave me inspiration. You all were and still are an inspiration and a reminder why I write.&lt;/p&gt;" />
