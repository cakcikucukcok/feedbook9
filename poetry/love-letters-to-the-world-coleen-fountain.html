      <meta name="description" content="Volume 2 Love Letter to the World is a book of poems and letters. It has thoughts and feelings of people I love. It has a portion that speaks as if Jesus was here talking with a love that he would have. I like for my readers to see how, when youre in love, the way one expresses their feelings and thoughts out on paper. I basically did this to make a book. I liked expressing myself in these thoughts. I wanted to share these with you the readers. This is pretty much what this book is about. Did I mention it is not a PG either? It gets a bit steamy at times. You just have to use your imagination." />
