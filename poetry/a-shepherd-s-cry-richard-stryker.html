      <meta name="description" content="Gods main purpose in coming to earth in the form of his Son, Jesus Christ, has always been to draw people unto himself. He desires more than anything the fellowship and love from those he created. As we all face lifes countless trials, I pray his Holy Spirit would use these poems, which I believe have been inspired by him alone, to write and to draw you close to his Sons side and realize that nothing life has to offer is greater than his love and gift of eternal life to all who seek him.
Again I pray that God would prompt you to read these poems, and through them, you would come to know this precious gift of Jesus Christ." />
