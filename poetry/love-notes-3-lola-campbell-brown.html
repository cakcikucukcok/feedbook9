  <title>Love Notes 3 - Lola Campbell-Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is love and He finds ways to communicate His love to humankind. We in turn, engage in acts of worship to reciprocate His immeasurable love for us.
Love Notes 3 is the third in a trilogy of books about love. This latest edition depicts Gods love through worship and, more specifically, fasting and prayer. The lessons learnt through these reflections are effectively Lola Campbell-Brown communicated and extrapolated over three years during the Christian time of Lent.
The author takes us on a mirrored reflection of victorious advocacy where personal, godly, encounters are evident, showing us definitively that Gods love is palpable even during adversity.
A recurring theme in this trilogy and in this latest edition is that love should be practised even in adversarial circumstances. In todays society, where there is much pain and turmoil, Gods love needs to be demonstrated and administered to all." />
