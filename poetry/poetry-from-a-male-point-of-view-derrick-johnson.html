  <title>Poetry from a Male Point of View - Derrick Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written from a mans point of view. It has funny, serious, sexual, and interesting poems. I didnt include any pictures in this book because I didnt want to paint an image of my poems. I want you to clear your mind, open your heart, and really feel what Im trying to say. My book is full of facts and fiction. I wrote poems for my friends who were trying to get a little romantic with their girlfriends or wives. I got a lot of positive feedback and more poem requested, so I thought I should share them with the rest of the world. The book has poems and short stories. I included some short stories to give you a sample of what to expect next." />
