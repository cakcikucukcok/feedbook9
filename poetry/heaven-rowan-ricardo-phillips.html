  <title>Heaven - Rowan Ricardo Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Poetry Collections of 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of NPR&#39;s Best Books of 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Long-listed for the National Book Award in poetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who the hell&#39;s heaven is this?&quot; Rowan Ricardo Phillips offers many answers, and none at all, in &lt;i&gt;Heaven&lt;/i&gt;, the piercing and revelatory encore to his award-winning debut, &lt;i&gt;The Ground&lt;/i&gt;. Swerving elegantly from humor to heartbreak, from Colorado to Florida, from Dante&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Paradise&lt;/i&gt; to Homer&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt;, from knowledge to ignorance to awe, Phillips turns his gaze upward and outward, probing and upending notions of the beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &quot;Feeling, real feeling / with all its faulty / Architecture, is / Beyond a god&#39;s touch&quot;--but it does not elude Phillips. Meditating on feverish boyhood, on two paintings by Chuck Close, on Shakespeare&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Measure for Measure&lt;/i&gt;, on a dead rooster by the side of the road in Ohio, on an elk grazing outside his window, his language remains eternally intoxicating, full of play, pathos, and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &quot;The end,&quot; he writes, &quot;like / All I&#39;ve ever told you, is uncertain.&quot; Or, elsewhere: &quot;The only way then to know a truth / Is to squint in its direction and poke.&quot; Phillips--who received a 2013 Whiting Writers&#39; Award as well as the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award--may not be certain, but as he squints and pokes in the direction of truth, his power of perception and elegance of expression create a place where beauty and truth come together and drift apart like a planet orbiting its star. The result is a book whose lush and wounding beauty will leave its mark on readers long after they&#39;ve turned the last page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
