  <title>Animal Chatter - Patricia Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a poetry book that includes twenty-four short poems about animals. Each poem is four to five stanzas long. In most of the poems, the animals themselves are doing the talking. Most of the animals have a problem that needs to be solved. A humorous twist at the end of most of the poems solves the problem. The poems were created for memorization by first graders. After memorizing the poems, the children would create a suitable costume, stand before a microphone, and recite the poem to their parents and classmates for an end-of-the-year program. Animals included are zoo animals, farm animals, and even a spider and a fly. The book should appeal to younger children too." />
