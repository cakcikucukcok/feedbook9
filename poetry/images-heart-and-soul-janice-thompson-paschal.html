  <title>Images: Heart and Soul - Janice Thompson Paschal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;About the book:  Part I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Growing up in the sixties with a lighthearted and sometimes taking a hard look at
Myself and others.  Images and words in verse and unique storytelling. 
EventsMusicCharacters and Atmosphere all encompass the journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Children who were able to be children..Adults who took us by the shoulders
And looked into our faces and gave us no way out!!! We learned to think and create games and strategies clueless to what this really brought to our lives ~ just making 
it up skipping happily into the future.  The courage it took to do what we did and become survivors. The Humor yeah its funny Now!  Yesterday... No do overs and that is real.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part II &lt;/b&gt; Today we Fall in Real Love!! We are in so Deep. (Who is laughing now?) 
A Rising spirit is the Survivor in us all I once was lost and now  Strengthening
Exercise a hard workout to become better at finding ourselves.Whered I put that???
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is not a dress rehearsal.
