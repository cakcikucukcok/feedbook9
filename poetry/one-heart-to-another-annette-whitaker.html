  <title>One Heart to Another - Annette Whitaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inspirational work of a native Houstonian, Annette Whitaker, has been featured in many collections of poetry, published worldwide by Noble House, The American Poetry Society, Quill Books, and Poetry.com. She is an author and a poet, inspired by the famous Maya Angelou who believes sharing experiences (life lessons) joys and pain is how people lean on one another, support one another, and believe in one another. She writes each poem or story believing no other experience in life is as fulfilling as helping others persevere through all situations. She set examples for family and friends as she develops into a leader of integrity who teaches followers to be positive, confident, and successful. It is her belief that we as people are not isolated in our troubles and together we learn that we can overcome them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She is certainly gifted, and it is a privilege to have someone of her integrity and intellect, not to mention such a rich sole to have as a colleague ____ Russel Hicks  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My best friend.she has such a sweet and godly spirit that I respect and admire. God has blessed her with the gift of writing. Now, others can share in the richness of her blessings ____ Andrea Lightfoot" />
