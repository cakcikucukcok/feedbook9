  <title>Being Gay Being Bi Whatever - Ian Bradley Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this anthology Ian Bradley Marshall has successfully brought together many of the issues that LGB people face on a daily basis and set these against an historical perspective that shows that intolerance around a persons sexual orientation is something that will always lead to disaster for any society. It is this prejudice and ignorance of basic human nature that continues to affect millions of people in this country and around the world, despite the many warnings that genocides of the past should have taught us. 
We know what its like to be different and we have to use our life experiences to help others, including those people that just dont understand that we were made to be gay or bi or whatever. I know that just trying to be yourself is the most important thing you can be in your life, however uncomfortable that makes other people. You have to be comfortable with yourself first and foremost." />
