  <title>Poetry from the Seasons of My Life - CeCe Penne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the most precious and priceless gifts in the world is the heart of a woman. A beautiful kaleidoscope of raw emotions, experiences, and memories, a womans heart knows no boundaries or limitations regarding her cherished and sacred love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether old, young, rich, poor, black, or whitewe have all craved love from another. We are ordinary women-but possess extraordinary love. At one period in time, we each have loved, whether or not love actually decided to pay us a visit, stay around for a while, or unselfishly love us back. It may not always reciprocate or manifest itself how we desire. Sometimes it may be followed by hurt, disappointment, loss or death, but we still keep on loving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When permitted to give wholly and freely, a womans satiable heart is unadulterated and her love is both timeless and unconditional Her love is naked and pure
resilient and determinedpatient and forgiving...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quest to find her destiny, every woman will inevitably experience powerful and unpredictable seasons on her journey called Life, as love etches indelible lines of poetry across her impressionable heart. I invite you to enter into my heart and share my poetry from the seasons of my life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
