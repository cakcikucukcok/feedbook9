  <title>Rhythm &amp; Muse - Thomas MacCalla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Thomas or TAM in print. I was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut during the Crash of &#39;29 and only those who left before me know when I will leave. I was raised by a loving family, with four older siblings and Doc and Esther as parents and role models. I was educated by the Jesuits, groomed by the Marine Corps, and blessed with JC, my life&#39;s treasure in a growing marriage of over fifty years, and four talented and caring children. 
Professionally, I was an elementary and high school teacher, a college professor, assistant school superintendent, senior university administrator, publisher and editor of a specialized newspaper, The Minority Enterprise, an entrepreneur, and a dreamer. Graduated from Fairfield College Preparatory School (1947), received a bachelor&#39;s degree (1951) and master&#39;s degrees (1954) from Fairfield University. Earned a doctorate in education and American literature from the University of California, Los Angeles (1964) and completed a post-doctoral program in urban planning from UCLA (1976). 
I always have been curious and wanting to be better. From childhood I was steeped in writing, music, and sports, waiting for my turn at bat or on the court. I wrote poems for personal pleasure and professional articles to validate my role as an educator. Through Rhythm and Muse, I want to share over seventy five years of life&#39;s adventure and start a new season on an upbeat." />
