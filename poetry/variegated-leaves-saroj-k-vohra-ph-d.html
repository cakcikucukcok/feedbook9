  <title>Variegated Leaves - Saroj K. Vohra Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Variegated Leaves is an ensemble of poems inspired by a variety of events and written over a period of several years. Almost every poem tells a moving story based on a lifetime worth of varying relationships. Some passages are joyful, while others may carry despair. Nevertheless, they are lyrical, demonstrating an uncanny knack and prowess to rhyme. The poems blend lifes personal experiences with creative, imaginative, and profound thoughts and insight. Each original poem is rich, textured, and musical; encompassing many of lifes day to day challenges. Any of the poems could be a portrait or a sculpture, carefully constructed by the artist. In Variegated Leaves, the words are the tools, masterfully put together, inspired by human thought and emotion, and dedicated to sharing an intimate story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
