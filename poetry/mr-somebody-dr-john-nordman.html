      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I believe that I have a lot to provide to the minds and hearts of my readers. I believe in this book I have put my heart, my tears, and my hope for those who need help. So many want to know how to love again, forgive completely, and understand their place in life. That is what I have tried to do in poetry. I have tried show that we have a God that is always there and he has given us a life worth living and a future that we can count on. Here you will find Jesus Christ and his reaching out to us all. Here is my life on paper as a gift, hoping that it will find a place in the hearts of all who will open the pages and find rest herein.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;I love John Nordman and I love poetry. The two together are the reasons that I enjoy this book. The pages enclosed will challenge thought, inspire loyalty, and bring multiple smiles.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
