  <title>Raw Emotions - Verona C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Raw Emotions&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, the book, words are expressed in its truest state. It doesnt dilute the realities as they appear. Instead, it opens up to a rhythm, a beat, that though sad some of the experiences might be, emotion expressed without any form of pretense will help to inspire or motivate one to a higher level of thought. The book covers a spiritual realm, societal, and personal. You will laugh, you will cry, yes, you will be saddened at times but at the end of that verse you will simply learn to appreciate the power of words in context. &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Raw Emotions&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; is as it is; its title portrays nothing that is sugar coated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The author hopes that the content of this book will open up a conversation, be it with a stranger, a friend, or a relative. This book will have readers laughing at, &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Internet&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; crying at &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Flowers That Didnt Bloom,&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wanting to become like; &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;His Name was Job,&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; looking at the mentally challenged in a different way as one reads: &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;They Say Im Mad.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Having pity on those we call bosses when we read &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Sour Power&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; and for women to reach out and demand the respect they deserve and to applaud the men who do give this respect after reading &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Antique Man&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; and those who have never had a &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Flat Bridge&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; experience, desiring to do so. For the precious moments spent in childhood innocence with a friend who you chose to Remember in a most special way. The collection of literary pieces the author hopes will be widely appreciated by all. She hopes that her writing will be a voice to the voiceless." />
