  <title>Moonbeams in the Bitter Rain - Jayne Linke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Through her poetry in &lt;em&gt;Moonbeams in the Bitter Rain&lt;/em&gt; Jayne Linke invites understanding of what it is to come through harsh and life-changing events. Crisp, raw and achingly honest, her writing at times gives voice to her experience of being perceived and treated as broken, expressing the desire to be related to fully and naturally, to be engaged with as spirited and alive. Rich with allegory and beauty, her words move beyond isolation and despair to a sense of soulful connection and transcendence. Her openness to beauty, life and nature and her interconnectedness with it all shines through, as does her experience of joy, play and freedom. To know Jayne, to read her poetry is to witness the expression of a sharp and observant intellect and wit, a depth of ability to make connections after an experience of trapped and enforced silence. It is to be touched profoundly by the power of love and tenacity in her and her family.&amp;rsquo; - Colleen Lamshed&lt;/p&gt;" />
