  <title>Casanova - Simon Karanja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Casanova is a poem about a boy who leaves for university a relatively
innocent person with universal ideas on life and love. The whole poem was
written so as to take the reader through the stages of his transformation
as he meets and interacts with various girls from varsity.
The poem starts off just as he joins varsity and leaves behind the life he
had before for a fresh start in this new world of freedom. It starts off
showing the wild side of university and how the freshman is eventually
led into his first infatuation, heartbreak, and the way it changes him.
The story continues through showing all the girls he gets involved with
and how they eventually turn him from an innocent guy to a Casanova.
The story then takes the freshman through a rude awakening when he
gets involved with a fragile girl who believes shes found her soul mate
only to realize thats not how things always work out when the nowtainted
freshman decides to keep his distance from her.
Casanova (not the legendary one) is simply rich in diversity of subject
and substance.
