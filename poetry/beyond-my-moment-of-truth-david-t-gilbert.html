  <title>Beyond My Moment of Truth - David T. Gilbert.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After completing my first book, I sat down and took notes of what was learned from what I did, and I must admit that I had learned an enormous amount of information about publishing. 
There were things to consider, like preparation of work, presentation of poetry, promotional strategies, etc., and still having Parkinsons Disease didnt do me any favours. But as I have always stated, you cant keep a champion down, and with my God being so gracious in more ways than I am able to acknowledge, I press on with my quest, to try and give as many people as I am able, a solid, even chance of salvation. 
My style of poetry may be somewhat unusual, maybe a bit out of the ordinary, but I have always tried to make my work as appealing as I can to as many as there are who love the simplicity of my work. I have tried to reduce the introductions of each poem to a minimum, but I still value the introductions, as they help to bring clarity to the point that I am attempting to put across, and therefore, very few misunderstandings and upsets are made. 
It must be emphasized that my poetry expresses mu point of view on subjects written about, how I actually see things from my angle, you may see differently, or may even disagree, but no matter what, I have designed my work specifically with the task of getting people to open up about the topics I write about, because there is nothing like a good, open debate to allow people the opportunity to communicate with each other, and so open up a door for an opportunity to present all with a chance of salvation. 
As I wrote in my last book, my primary objective is the saving of souls, and by presenting my work in such a simple way, I may assist people to realize that Jesus died for all, and so salvation is also for all who dare to believe." />
