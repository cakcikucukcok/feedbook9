  <title>Head Lines - John Yurechko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Head Lines: Poems and Passages&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poems that were written to be read out loud, either alone, or with one another, or in a group. They chronicle the life and experiences of author John Yurechko. They are written in a style and format that lends itself to reading out loud, with line breaks, BIG VOICES in ALL CAPITALS, and whispers in italics, pauses, rushes, vocalizations, etc. These visual guides are as much a part of the writing as the words themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Head Lines&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of the authors writings spanning fifty years. He reflects on topics ranging from his childhood in a steel town, to life in California, Virginia and North Carolina, and to everyday events that he describes in these poems and passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Raking Leaves&lt;/br&gt;
. . . Then to the Masters own backyard:&lt;/br&gt;
there are rake hands on the Rovers of Mars,&lt;/br&gt;
to scrape deep into all the sustaining planets.&lt;/br&gt;
And rakes in Voyagers arms,&lt;/br&gt;
sweeping up the swirling mess of the galaxies,&lt;/br&gt;
raking time and space so the heavens will look&lt;/br&gt;
gloriously orderly and ready for pickup on&lt;/br&gt;
The Last Trash Day.&lt;/br&gt;
With this work, we reverse the billions of autumns,&lt;/br&gt;
raise up all the droppings,&lt;/br&gt;
and resurrect The Very First Tree.&lt;/br&gt;
Nailing the leaves to the branches,&lt;/br&gt;
stabbing the branches back into the trunk&lt;/br&gt;
and the trunk into the ground;&lt;/br&gt;
the roots back into the seed;&lt;/br&gt;
