  <title>Poems from a Soldier - Stephen A. Janke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Vietnam War deeply divided our nation during the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s. Our returning soldiers during America&#39;s longest war were treated shamefully in parts of the country. In time the public has learned to separate the war and the warrior. As a result many veterans did not speak of their year away from home for a long time if ever. It took me 20 years to slowly tell people by way of poems what it was like. At first they trickled out and then the trickle turned into a flood through the years.
   This book is also about the wonderful War Dogs of Vietnam. My sentry dog&#39;s name was Kobuc. Our Air Base was the largest in Vietnam. The Security Policemen were the first line of defense to protect the many bases in Vietnam. I served at Cam Ranh Air Base with a great bunch of guys that made that long year almost tolerable.
Most of the several thousand dogs that went to Vietnam never returned.This book tells their story as well." />
