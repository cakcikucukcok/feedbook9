  <title>Flashes of Life - Mildred Lee West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many are going through trials and disappointments, and feel that they are in a mold with nothing more to fold; although, there are reasons to fear, there are also many reasons to hope for freedom from the mold and hope that better ways of living will soon unfold. 
Believe that there are still many rainbows with inlays of your favorite colors just as there are for others, so continue with the faith that some day soon, joy will flick within your heart like the flame of a candle thats freshly lit, and your face will be fashioned with a smile as you view many days with bright sun ray as you go about your way.
Trials and disappointments tap into our inner strength; therefore, inner strength and wisdom are evidence of trails and disappointments, and through wisdom we learn more ways to endure." />
