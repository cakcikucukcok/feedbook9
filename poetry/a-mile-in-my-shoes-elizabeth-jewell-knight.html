  <title>A Mile in My Shoes - Elizabeth Jewell Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Mile In My Shoes is a poetry book unlike any youve ever seen before. It
takes you on a journey of emotion that ranges from the deepest depression to
the highest pinnacle of joy; sometimes all in the same poem!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its about a mental illness called Bipolar Disorder; formerly called Manic
Depression, and its symptoms. Its about unrequited love; its about anger,
loneliness, children, hope, and gratitude. If youve ever experienced these
feelings, or know someone who has, you will love this book. It will allow you to
understand mental illness on the most basic level, yet bring you to the heights
of compassion and fulfillment that youve never experienced before. You just may discover another side to mental illness-- the human side. Enjoy!" />
