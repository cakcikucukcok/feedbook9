  <title>Dare 2 B Different - Ysidra Rivers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is the translator of my inner self and my spiritual self.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Poetry is the language I use to express what I dont quite understand.  Poetry is indeed a gift.  This gift gives me peace.  Peace is whats left after releasing, in poetry, my aches, my pain, and my sorrows.  And poetry even extends my hopes and joy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Poetry helps me to except who I really am, even that part of me that I dont like.  Its not until after a completion of a poem, that I see or hear what Ive seen or heard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Often times I misunderstand myself, until my spirit leads to me clarify myself to myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Everything that is made and was made was made by God.  There is nothing new under the sun.  Everything that is given and was given was given by God.  There is nothing new under the Son.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every good thing is from the Lord.  What I do with my good thing is up to me.  And everything I do, I do to glorify the Lord.  And this gift, which is a good thing to anyone who hears and accepts it, will be to the Glory of God.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When I was a child, I thought as a child.  But when I grew in the Spirit, I put away those childish things.  There are records of my childish *waes of my very childish thinking.  I did not understand my gift, thou I used my gift to the best of my childish understanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now that I understand my gift and acknowledge the strength in my gift, I use this gift to help others, to reach others and to express love to others in a wae that others could understand, accept and receive the love of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
