  <title>Holy Spirit Led - Kollin L. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Holy Trinity consists of the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Much is known about the Father and the Son, but the Holy Spirit is like the unsung hero. Before Jesus ascended into heaven, He told His disciples about the coming of the Advocate, the Holy Spirit of the Lord (John 16:7) to help them and how people would do greater things than what He did during His time on earth (John 14:12). The Holy Spirit of the Lord is still with us, but unfortunately a lot of believers are not with Him, and their religion lacks spirituality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Spirit Led: My Steps Are Ordered is a reminder that we have an Advocate, a gift from the LORD GOD to help get us through life here on earth while providing a connection to Him. Jesus ministered with the help of the Holy Spirit, and at the beginning of His ministry, He said, The Spirit of the LORD GOD is upon Me; because the LORD hath anointed Me (Isaiah 61:1 KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is a gift to us, and He also has gifts for us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
