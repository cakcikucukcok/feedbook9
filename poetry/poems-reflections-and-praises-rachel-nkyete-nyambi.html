  <title>Poems, Reflections and Praises - Rachel Nkyete Nyambi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of inspirational poems about faith, hope and love may be used as praises, including sung praises. They celebrate life and its challenges, searching for why in the times of trouble, grief, nostalgia, joy and peace that come with surrendering to God. They also give thanks to God for always being there despite our imperfect nature as His children. One of their characteristics is the writers consciousness of the limited time and seasons of Gods creation versus the eternity of God the Creatorthe transient state of the world versus the unchanging nature of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer combines lyric poetry with a modern approach that is flexible in terms of form, rhyme and rhythm. It is influenced by tonal language, a rhythm used for centuries in sub-Saharan Africa, China, Vietnam and a great part of Eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their focus on spiritual and religious themes portrays the writers feelings, state of mind, and perception and, as such, may touch the emotions of its readers who can personally relate with the words of the poems or with the lyrics of the songs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
