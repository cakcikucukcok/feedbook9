  <title>Thoughts of Love and Life - Nancy Brookfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thoughts of Love and Life is a collection of poetry that asks and perhaps answers questions about who and what we are. Written on subjects ranging from faith to folly, as well as from life to death, author Nancy Brookfield exhibits a questioning, restless mind with but one conviction: that mankind has meaning and can improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring green grass is growing now&lt;br /&gt;
and in warming winds it plays&lt;br /&gt;
It reaches toward the blue of the sky&lt;br /&gt;
and grows higher with each day&lt;br /&gt;
Then the heat of the sun will turn it gold&lt;br /&gt;
and the farmer will cut it down&lt;br /&gt;
The grain that he gathers from the fallen shafts&lt;br /&gt;
will go to the miller in town&lt;br /&gt;
And the miller will make the flour&lt;br /&gt;
and the baker will make the bread&lt;br /&gt;
The green grass serves his purpose&lt;br /&gt;
and lives though he is dead&lt;br /&gt;
Would that I could do so much&lt;br /&gt;
with this life of mine&lt;br /&gt;
And leave something behind to feed your souls&lt;br /&gt;
with the passing of my time&lt;/p&gt;" />
