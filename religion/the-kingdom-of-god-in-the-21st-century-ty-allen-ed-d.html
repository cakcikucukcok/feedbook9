  <title>The Kingdom of God in the 21St Century - Ty Allen Ed. D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The kingdom of God is the called out people of God (Col. 1:1314) from the world of darkness as the spiritual family of Christ. The kingdom of God is bound up in the age of grace and truth and is the fulfillment of Gods promise to Abraham to bless all nations of people. The kingdom of God in prophecy started during the Roman rule (Dan. 2:44) with the Jews at Pentecost in Jerusalem (ca. 33 AD) and then to the Gentile world to include our present age. Jesus reigns as Lord and Christ over His church / the kingdom of God in the twenty-first century and continues to call people of every nation to walk with Him by faith, repentance, and baptism in His name until the consummation of all things and His second return. The Christian Age is the eschatology (Last Day events) of Jesuss reign under the leadership of the Holy Spirit through the preached Word. The salvation of the Gentile nations is the final work of God to restore what was lost in heaven through Satan and his angels (Rev. 12:710). When Jesus appears, his reign ends, and the spiritual family and the church of Christ / kingdom of God will go home." />
