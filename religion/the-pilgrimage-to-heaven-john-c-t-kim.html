  <title>The Pilgrimage to Heaven - John C. T. Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Pilgrimage to Heaven: How to Have Eternal Life and Enter Heaven&lt;/i&gt; focuses attention on two contrasting paths people may take through their lives: the way of indulging personal desires and the way of following Jesus Christ. Author John C. T. Kim provides honest and unsparing glimpses of his journey into the hell of his own creation and the rescue he received through the promise of new life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. His story invites greater appreciation of travails such journeys entail, while providing authentication for the witness he makes to the work of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four main sections share personal stories and Christian witness under the headings of The Way of Man, The Life in the World, The Way of God, and The Life in Christ Jesus. Explanations of key biblical terms, explorations of current cultural practices, and consideration of the Bibles message combine to draw out the spiritual challenges of sinful living and to lift up the spiritual blessings of righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have found yourself wondering how you fell into captivity to the forces of evil, how you slid into poverty of spirit, and how you wandered into a wilderness of doubt, &lt;i&gt;The Pilgrimage to Heaven&lt;/i&gt; offers straightforward and informed guidance for turning your life around, taking a step off of the road gone wrong, and making your pilgrimage toward heaven as a committed disciple of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
