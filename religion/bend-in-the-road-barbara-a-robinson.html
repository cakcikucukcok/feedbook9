  <title>Bend in the Road - Barbara A. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no blueprint for grieving. There are not any steps, directions, or instructions to understanding our pain. There are no words of wisdom that can change our situation and no medicine to heal the wound left when our heart breaks. I cannot give you any advice or a recipe on how to grieve, nor tell you how long to grieve, how you should feel, or what actions to take to cope with your pain. I can only say that God does not make mistakes. I can also share with you my experiences, my journey, my faith, and my glory dance steps of life. Your season of being with the love of your life who has gone on to glory is over. Accept that and dont put a question mark where God has put a period. I can only tell you what God did to heal my pain, and what He did for me, He will do for you. This life He gave me is a present, and each day I wake up is me unwrapping that gift. If I hold a pity party rather than trying to discover what God would have me do, it sends a message to God that I do not appreciate His gift. Lifes road bends, twists, goes up hills, into valleys, streams, rivers, over mountains, into pot holes, and around curves. Around the next bend may be heartache or happiness, pain or pleasure, sunshine or rain. Regardless of what lies around the next bend, God is always there, waiting with outstretched arms to either catch you if you fall or teach you how to fly. When you get to the end of your rope hand it to God, He will tie it around your waist and help you stand." />
