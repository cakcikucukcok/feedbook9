  <title>Rise and Fall of the Usa - Dean P. Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you believe that God is not dead, then who is He and what does He do? Does He take an active role of a father to provide for us, nurture us, and teach us? In my first bookWhen God Speaks, Who Will Listen?I discussed how our Father has nurtured me. I have had many unexpected encounters with Him where He has taught me through prophecy, spiritual language, and most of all, the written word that He has given us through holy men. My latest encounter lasted over eight years. He graciously opened my eyes to many mysteries and directed me to write several books of what He revealed. This book is part of what I was shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is our Father. Without Him we would not exist. He first gave birth to us as a spiritual being, creating us in the image of Himself. Then we were born of a woman by His design to become a living soul. He is responsible for the welfare of each of His children. He takes this very seriously. Throughout the history of this world, He has acted through certain men like Adam, Noah, and Melchizedek to accomplish His plan for us. He also worked through a man named Abram to form a nation of people He could use for the benefit of all of His children. Through Isaiah and other Prophets He told how His work with these children is not yet complete. He revealed how Jerusalem is not the only city of God, and the descendants of Abraham are not His only people. He has also formed nations of people upon the land of America. This book tells what our Father wants us to hear at this time about these people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
