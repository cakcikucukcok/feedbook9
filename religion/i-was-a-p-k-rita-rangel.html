  <title>I Was a P.K.... - Rita Rangel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is my story; how I came from a good Christian home and my perspective as a PK; of what it is to have Pastors for parents and the pragmatic challenges that are rarely talked about. I share chilling accounts of what goes on in a PK home that should be read by all. I am transparent in sharing my experience in hopes of bringing awareness to others about Pastors and family life. What should have been a good, happy, balanced life being brought up in church and knowing better, went quite the opposite. I left my faith and lived a life with alcohol, drugs and a life of promiscuity. I later married my husband, who was a powerful ring leader of this ruthless prison gang. My activities inevitably ended me in jail with charges that should have left me to do life without. I should have died, but God had a purpose and a plan for my life all along. You wont be able to put this book down!&lt;/p&gt;" />
