  <title>Celebrating the Eucharist: A Practical Ceremonial Guide for Clergy and Other Liturgical Ministers - Patrick Malloy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this first new Eucharistic customary in nearly 20 years, Patrick Malloy, an Episcopal priest and liturgical scholar, presents a clear, illustrated guide for the presider and other leaders of the liturgy, contemporary in approach but based on ancient and classic principles of celebration.  Like its predecessors, the 1979 Book of Common Prayer is long on telling the Church what to say, and short on telling it what to do. This leaves those who &quot;choreograph&quot; prayer book liturgies with a complex task and a powerful influence over the faith of the Church. The author begins with a concise theology of the liturgy that underpins all of his specific directives in the book.  Contents include: theological and liturgical principles; liturgical ministry and liturgical ministers; liturgical space; vesture, vessels, and other liturgical objects; the liturgical year; the shape of the liturgy; the sung liturgy and singing during the liturgy; the order of the Eucharist (the &quot;heart&quot; of the book); and the celebration of baptism during the Eucharist." />
