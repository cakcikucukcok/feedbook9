  <title>Healing a Lifestyle - Christine Beumier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you want your faith to be strengthened? Would you be in favor of tips that will make you into the truth of divine healing? If so, here is the right script. Throughout your reading, you will discover how much we are in favor of the covenant of Yahve Raphe. The study of the biblical narratives of Jesuss healing ministry are accompanied by contemporary reports that show how Jesus acts even today. What God wants for us is to be ready to receive His healing and, hence, to show His love to those who need it so that they also can be healed. Good reading and good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Beumier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much ink has flowed on the subject of healing. This book, however, stands out for its simplicity, clarity of themes, and spirit of synthesis. It is based on the word of God; that is its strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for both scholars as well as young people in search of light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
