  <title>Seven Days to Heaven - C.T. Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What if you were living in the most prolific times in Revelations and you had to give your life to save another for God&#39;s purpose of ushering the war in heaven to earth, would you do it? This is the choice that Senar Baines and several others were faced with. Their destiny lies in their faith and they learned that their life too had a purpose even though they will die in all the chaos and mayhem their souls will not and each of their deaths will further God&#39;s will. As with John the Baptist, they will meet one woman (Anyia) who has been given the burden of preparing the way for God&#39;s people in the first days of Revelations. While being hunted by demons, aliens, man made cross breeds and Satan himself, Senar finds that faith is everything and to be careful because you might be entertaining an angel. While on this seven day journey, one by one God brings these seven people together to be his warriors; not only to battle those beast which man has made, but they also have to battle aliens whose trying to herd us like cattle; cross breeds, hybrid forms of human beings, demons and Satan himself, but through it all, those individuals chosen by God to fight alongside of Anyia became so full of faith, that they wavered not. They all got to see their purpose and to see God&#39;s army of angels save the earth not only from Satan and the other unknown things in our universe, but even from ourselves. This book Seven Days to Heaven, will test your soul, your heart and your faith.&lt;/P&gt;" />
