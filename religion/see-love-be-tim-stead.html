  <title>See, Love, Be - Tim Stead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many have been hugely helped by mindfulness practice. But how do we move beyond our initial goal of functioning well to live a life marked by deep awareness, genuine compassion and ease of being?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tim Stead is an accredited mindfulness teacher who seeks to explore this very question. Offering new versions of familiar practices, he meditates on three key themes – see, love, be – that connect strongly with the concerns of many great spiritual traditions. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This warm-hearted book will resonate as much with those who do not have a faith commitment as with those who do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Thoughtful and intensely practical, &lt;i&gt;See, Love, Be&lt;/i&gt; offers a fascinating insight into the human condition. I particularly enjoyed the use of the well-judged poems at the end of each chapter.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Mosley, science journalist, TV presenter &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and producer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
