  <title>Jesus Is God—Surprised! - Salome Nhira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus Is GodSurprised!&lt;/em&gt; This revelatory book focuses on the undeniable and yet surprising truth that Jesus is God. It parallels the names, characteristics, and attributes of God the Father, to that of His Son, Jesus Christ. You will be convinced from the scriptures, inspirationally mined from the Word of God and spoken directly by God the Father to His people from Genesis to Revelation and by the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, that Jesus is more than the Son of God. All scriptural conversations attest that this stranger from Galilee is indeed God, Elohim, I Am, Yahweh, Jehovah, Adonai, El Shaddai, Shammah, in fact all the attributes of His Father. Your spiritual understanding and consciousness of the deity of Jesus Christ will transcend to another dimension. Like Zacchaeus in Luke 19 who wanted to see who Jesus is, this book is a very simple way in which the Lord is asking you to dine with Him. After the sumptuous divine meal of this book, you are going to be fully convinced that Jesus is God. Information is simply head knowledge, but revelation from this book is internal. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
