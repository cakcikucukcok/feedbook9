  <title>1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians - James H. Grant Jr., R. Kent Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote to the church in Thessalonica to encourage them to live in the light of the gospel. In his two letters he addresses a number of topics, including the persecution they were enduring, the second coming of Christ, and how they were to live in the present times. While the letters were written nearly two thousand years ago, pastor James H. Grant Jr. insists that Paul&amp;rsquo;s audience includes us as well as the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant applies Paul&amp;rsquo;s message to contemporary churches by moving expositionally through 1 &amp;amp; 2 Thessalonians. Twenty-five sermons examine each passage of the books as the gospel and its implications are unpacked in light of Christ&amp;rsquo;s second coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 &amp;amp; 2 Thessalonians&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Preaching the Word commentary. The series is noted for its unqualified commitment to biblical authority, clear exposition of Scripture, readability, and practical application. It is an ideal resource for pastors and teachers, as well as for personal Bible study.&lt;/p&gt;" />
