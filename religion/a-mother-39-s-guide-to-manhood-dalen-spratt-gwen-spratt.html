  <title>A Mother&#39;s Guide to Manhood - Dalen Spratt, Gwen Spratt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The best teachers in life are those who have not only studied, but truly experienced the message that they are trying to relay. Whether it is religion, sports, or simple life lessons, your words and actions must be genuine. A wise man once said, You can&#39;t teach what you don&#39;t know, but if you do know, why not spread the knowledge.
The words on these pages were written to inspire hope. They are not only meant for the multitude of people that don&#39;t believe a woman can raise a son into a successful man without the immediate help of a father, but as well as for the individuals who are proving that theory wrong every day.  There is hope.
Through faith, strength, dedication, and prayer a former school teacher turned pastor was able to successfully raise her son into a respectable, focused, and driven man.  This story and its lessons highlight the ups and downs, the smiles and frowns, and the tears of joy and sorrow that are all a part of the tremendous journey that a mother and son embark on together through life&#39;s everlasting trials and tribulations." />
