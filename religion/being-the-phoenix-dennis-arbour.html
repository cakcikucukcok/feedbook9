  <title>Being the Phoenix - Dennis Arbour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The phoenixis it a legendary bird or a state of existence?
This is a fully documented story of a near-death experience while under severe medical duress. The entirety occurred in a period of less than three months and entailed cancer, its hard cure, a permanent paralysis, and succumbing to a fatal illness while in a coma. No one believed this man would live, let alone recover. But this became the spectacular stage for miracles of the most astounding kind that still, to this date, have no medical explanation. The medical efforts were of a towering and exceptional nature, yet all seemed to lead to a dead end. And then the gateway of another reality showed its very loving hand toward us as individuals in the giving of miracles, visions, and a final spellbinding triumph over all.
Inlaid in the floor of the rehabilitation center was a phoenix, the sign of death and resurrection, saying ones life can be rebuilt from mere ashes. Although not noticed at first, it became an obvious coincidence and a footnote direct from the heavens. The authors journey runs so parallel to the phoenix that he became one. In returning from death, he was new and brought great treasures, as opposed to things and possessions of the world. Although many professionals are highly interested in this material, it remains a story of all of us and for all of us.
Ponder, laugh, cry, wonder, despair, and finally triumph in this story. It is truly miraculous and breathtaking." />
