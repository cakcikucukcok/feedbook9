      <meta name="description" content="The Song of Songs, which is Solomons. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee (Song of Solomon 1:13). Our Lord is our great, great love, and we will do anything for Him because He first loved us. When the fragrance of our sins flooded His Fathers nostrils, all of heaven was searched for a remedy so that we could be united with God the Father. Jesus Christ, Son of God and Son of Man, volunteered to come to earth to face death and be crushed on a wooden cross to pay mans debts once and for all. He is our Rose of Sharon. I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys (Song of Solomon 2:1). His death on the cross and the shedding of sinless blood generated the sweetest fragrance all the way to heaven, which provided a way for all men to be free." />
