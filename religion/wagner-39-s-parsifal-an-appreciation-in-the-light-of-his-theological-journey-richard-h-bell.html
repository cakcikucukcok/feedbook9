  <title>Wagner&#39;s Parsifal: An Appreciation in the Light of His Theological Journey - Richard H. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parsifal, Wagner&#39;s final opera, is considered by many to be one of the greatest religious musical works ever composed; but it is also one of the most difficult to understand and many have questioned whether it can be considered a Christian work at all. Added to this is the furious debate that has surrounded the composer as an anti-Semite, racist, and inspiration for Hitler. Richard Bell addresses such issues and argues that despite any personal failings Wagner makes a fundamental theological contribution through his many writings and ultimately in Parsifal which, he argues, preaches Christ crucified in a way that can never be captured by words alone. He argues that Wagner offers a vision of the divine and a theology of Good Friday that can both function as profound therapy and address current theological controversies." />
