  <title>Born To Be Free: Discovering Christ&#39;s Power to Set You Free from a Painful Past - Tom Vermillion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many longtime believers have never experienced the freedom and transformation promised and seen on the pages of the New Testament. Many are stuck in pain and brokenness. More often than not, the church sends its hurting to the world for answers rather than to Christ, our healer and deliverer. Yet Scripture tells us that the real battles of life have roots and solutions in the spiritual realm rather than in the natural. Born to Be Free was birthed in the laboratory of helping hundreds of hurting Christians take hold of the promises of Christ for their life while experiencing the power of the risen Lord in doing so. Many books about healing and freedom develop only one aspect of what is needed and offered by Christ. Born to Be Free walks believers through a storehouse of truth and practices that ordinary believers can activate to move into the healing and freedom Christ purchased for them." />
