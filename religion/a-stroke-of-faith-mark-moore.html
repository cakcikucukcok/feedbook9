  <title>A Stroke of Faith - Mark Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Mark Moore always believed he was in charge of his life. All that changed on a beautiful Saturday morning in May 2007. Suddenly he was no longer in control of anything. Though his life will never return to his pre-stroke normality, through this crisis, he has gained a deeper understanding of the centrality of God&#39;s role in his life and in all of our lives. A STROKE OF FAITH tells the story of moving from acceptance to surrender and from hope to faith. It reveals God&#39;s work in Mark&#39;s life as He transformed him from thinking he had everything under control to knowing God has had control all along." />
