  <title>(Profanity)?! How I Went from an Atheist to Quantum Wizard in Less Than a Decade! - Joshua Ramay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story of awakening to the realities of Spirit and what might happen while racing down the rabbit hole of weirdness called modern metaphysics (physics of love). How could a person become an energy-healing evangelist after being a left-brained, sophistry-drenched atheist? It happened to me, my friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awakening arrived in an unexpected instant, but what also surprised me were the many bizarre events, grace-filled miracles, and education that followed for almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So heres what happened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is fantastic!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and feel that it will help many people. Although our individual journeys in life are completely unique and in fact Self-Designed, there are many helpful signposts that you can encounter on the way if you simply ask for them! This book can be one of those for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A captivating and amusing rollicking read!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks for the very generous and loving portrayal of the Matrix Energetics experience!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
