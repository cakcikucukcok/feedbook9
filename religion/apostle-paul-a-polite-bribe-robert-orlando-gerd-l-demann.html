  <title>Apostle Paul: A Polite Bribe - Robert Orlando, Gerd L端demann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul&#39;s dramatic and much-discussed conversion on the road to Damascus radically changed the course of his life--as well as the Christian religion. Can a new narrative, and a new perspective, be brought to this two-thousand-year-old story and centuries of critical thought and study? Writer and filmmaker Robert Orlando believes it can. Apostle Paul: A Polite Bribe is a dramatic and challenging book, inspired by his controversial film of the same name. This groundbreaking look at Paul&#39;s life draws on extensive research into Paul&#39;s letters and the book of Acts to reveal Paul&#39;s human attitudes and insecurities. Orlando reconstructs a fresh take on the Apostle Paul&#39;s life and proposes that Paul, as one of Christianity&#39;s most celebrated converts, may have needed more than faith and fervor to convince the other apostles to accept his vision of Christian ministry. Apostle Paul: A Polite Bribe illustrates how a vision of promise eventually leads to a hopeless prison cell and ultimately, a new religion, challenging the traditional perspective to inspire new thought on one of the best-known founders of the Christian religion." />
