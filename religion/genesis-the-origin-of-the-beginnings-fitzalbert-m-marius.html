  <title>Genesis, the Origin of the Beginnings - Fitzalbert M. Marius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unfortunately, most of our well-versed, highly educated, scripturally correct, biblically strong, doctrinally true interpreters of the Christian Bible have a tendency in their presentation of biblical topics, interpretations, and various studies to utilize generic terms without taking time to define the terminology so that everyone is on the same basic foundation. This book, Genesis, the Origin of the Beginnings, however, brings out the basic foundational subject matters as inspired by God through men. It establishes the theme and purpose of the whole Bible, shows you why every subject revealed throughout the scripture began in Genesis, and focuses on definitely defining terms such as Gods love so that you will not have to rely on your own interpretation based on such statements as Gods love is sacrificial, unconditional, etc. You will no longer struggle with the question what image of God am I? and the true meaning of life and so on.
You will then, in your future study of the scripture, be able to interpret all the symbolic, figurative, parabolic, and illustrative biblical revelations based on the foundational principles found in Genesis. You will find that the foundational principles are straightforward and transcend time, while situations are not and do not. Remember there is nothing simplistic about the written Word of God, who has created all the scripture to be known to all mankind of all times, regardless of future accumulation of knowledge and experience. So read Genesis, the Origin of the Beginnings and continue to grow in the Word." />
