  <title>The Real Magical Mystery Tour - Wes Ragsdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are all born with what the Bible calls an incurable wound. We cannot heal this wound ourselves, no matter how educated we are and no matter how much counseling we go to. In fact, there is no intelligence on the earth that can cure it-not the wisest men and women, and not the best doctors and scientists. It can only be healed by the Lord Jesus Christ-the Messiah. The Real Magical Mystery Tour can help us on our search for the cure to this incurable wound on all our hearts, and it is about getting our beginnings in Christ on a solid foundation. By learning the simple truths about this relationship with our Savior, we can endure our daily journeys with him through all the ups and downs that life throws our way. And in the end, it is these truths that will make this journey with him easier, simpler, and joyous-more so than we were taught before." />
