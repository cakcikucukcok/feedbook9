  <title>The Redeemer - Jack Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you curious about inviting the Lord into your life? &lt;br /&gt;
Have you recently done so and want to understand what its all about? &lt;br /&gt;
Are you a long time believer who wants to get back to the basics of our faith? &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
If your answer to any of these questions is Yes this book is for you. Its about what God intended in creating you, what has been stolen from you, and how God has been working since the dawn of time to get it back for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with an overview of the conditions and circumstances that led to man being in a state of permanent estrangement from God, followed by a more detailed account of His incredible effort to bring us back to Him. Well finish up with a summary of what He is doing for us now and what He has promised to do in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a clear and concise overview of what Christians believe and why. Reading this book can help you understand our faith as never before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as an added bonus, weve included several short topical studies to further enhance your comprehension of Gods Word.&lt;/p&gt;" />
