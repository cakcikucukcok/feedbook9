  <title>It Must Be Broken - Edmond Lyonga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I truly believe that the relationship between the name you
bear and the compound you came from form a bridge that the enemy can use to transact business in the spiritual realm.
This can be traced even geographically from territories that have and still host demonic manifestations. If you carefully look at your family compound and the name that our compound people bear, you will agree with me that if not all, many of us
need deliverance even though we have been in the Lord for so long. &lt;bR&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am asking every believer to do a reality check to make sure that all is well, do not suffer from spiritual malnutrition because of pride. Seek help from your spiritual leader to get out of your mess before it gets too late. This book will help you to perform spiritual diagnosis and surgery in your life, family, and the body of Christ. I caution every believer to reshape the future, by changing the past. Stay under the covering of the blood of Jesus, for you might be stung by a bee or beaten by a snake if you break the hedge." />
