  <title>An/Other Praxis: A Critical Option for Ecclesial Freedom - Herry M. Mukdani, Theodore W. Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today&#39;s ecclesial praxis has to add something to human capacity in order for the church to envision itself whole. This book addresses multiple struggles, as creative acts theologically, for rethinking a possibly constructive ecclesial praxis that addresses God&#39;s new creation in its relation to God&#39;s people. By examining it in broader paradigms, Herry Mukdani proposes an/Other praxis as a critical option for ecclesial freedom.   An/Other Praxis searches not only new impulses for theological practices, but the extension of voices from the margins that have contributed both to fresh ideas and to new opportunities for life. It also demands ecclesial praxis to put all existing voices into account, and responsibly re(dis-)cover the subaltern or subordinated others. Thus, this praxis helps the subaltern communities of faith claim their own identities, as border-crossers, in the midst of cultural and religious plurality. They will be active subjects of new theological productions from and for the church. They are able to prove theological creativity possible today that expands beyond its ecclesial limits.  An/Other Praxis will be of interest to readers not merely because they want to learn something beyond the existing forms of praxis. Rather, it will always give them refreshing energies capable of making rich and sometimes risky responses to the ministry possible and real. It will also give them attitude and perspective to improve a culturally diverse conversation in theology, and thus, it adds divers(al)ity in ministry and leadership in today&#39;s church." />
