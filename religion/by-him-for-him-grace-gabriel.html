  <title>By Him, for Him - Grace Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A teenage girl started a journal years ago when she was saved at the age of fifteen. That journal, and many others thereafter, turned into her first book. Grace grew up in a broken home that lacked love, family, and a father, but she promised herself that she would have a far better future and take care of her mum. Even though there were many obstacles in her way and she made many mistakes, she was forgiven and strengthened by God and His amazing grace. She pressed through difficult circumstances to mature into a true daughter of Christ. She is the only one in her immediate family to complete high school and study further. She holds a bachelors degree in theology. She is blessed to be married to a talented entrepreneur and musician, and together they are recording an album of songs that they wrote before they even met and are also planning to travel the world sharing the gospel of Christ through music and the Word of God. Her motto is to never give up, simply because Christ never did. As the songwriter wrote, You took the fall and thought of me. Through the years of writing this book about her real-life drama, one thing stuck out and that was, why was she created? Finally it dawned on herby Him, for Him alone!&lt;/p&gt;" />
