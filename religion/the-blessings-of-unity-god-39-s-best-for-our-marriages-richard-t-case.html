  <title>The Blessings of Unity: God&#39;s Best for Our Marriages - Richard T. Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many movements in today&#39;s society have combined to create an atmosphere that at best teaches married couples very little about how to find happiness together, and at worst threatens to destroy the sanctity with which God intends his children to approach that union. Self-centeredness and misinformation have led many away from walking in the Spirit and loving their spouses in Christlike ways, disqualifying them from the blessings that God has in store for his unified children. &lt;i&gt;The Blessings of Unity&lt;/i&gt; offers insight and ideas for creating godly unity in our marriages centered around two key concepts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;il&gt;1) Abiding in the Vine and walking in the Spirit, and&lt;/il&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;il&gt;2) Learning and applying the concept of unity.&lt;/il&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unity is achieved when a man and woman strive for agreement with God by processing His Will on every decision  and in every issue. Through Biblically-centered discussions of discord, division, unity, discipleship, and prayer, and through exploring Biblical examples of unity, Richard Case offers husbands and wives practical and spiritual advice for working together in unity in the Spirit so that they can more perfectly present themselves to God for his divine approval.&lt;/p&gt;" />
