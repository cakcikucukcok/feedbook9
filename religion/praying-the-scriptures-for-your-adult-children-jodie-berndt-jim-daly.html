  <title>Praying the Scriptures for Your Adult Children - Jodie Berndt, Jim Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As parents of adult children, we often wonder: &lt;em&gt;Will my children make good choices when they&amp;rsquo;re on their own? How can I let them go when I&amp;rsquo;ve held them for so long?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent and author Jodie Berndt understands what it&amp;rsquo;s like to release children into the world and still care deeply about them and everything they will face in life from relationships to career decisions and everything in between. In &lt;em&gt;Praying the Scriptures for Your Adult Children, &lt;/em&gt;Jodie continues her Praying the Scriptures series with biblical prayers for your adult children, whether they are just leaving the nest, flying well on their own, or struggling to take off at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each section focuses on a different aspect of adulthood, with encouraging stories from experienced parents who are praying their children through rocky marriages, health concerns, financial challenges and other real-life issues. At the end of each chapter, you&amp;rsquo;ll find personalized prayers for your children taken straight from Scripture. Each chapter also includes verses for you to pray for yourself as you take the challenging step of trusting God to care for your children in ways that you can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With grace and wisdom, Jodie addresses cultural trends such as couples living together before marriage and young adults leaving the church, as well as the painful realities of loneliness, addiction, and mental health issues. With hope-filled words for the parents of the prodigal, she is particularly sensitive to the long-term prayers we offer, even as we doubt ourselves and grieve over our children&amp;rsquo;s choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you are praying for, you will find confidence and peace in these powerful prayers for your kids. &lt;em&gt;Praying the Scriptures for Your Adult Children&lt;/em&gt; guides you to the bedrock of God&amp;rsquo;s promises as you release your children to God&amp;rsquo;s shepherding care.&lt;/p&gt;" />
