  <title>On My Way to Heaven - Michele E. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Summary
Life has a way of taking you through many unexpected twists and turns.  Know that God does not do these things to us. He allows things to happen to not only get our attention but to prepare us to operate and function within His purpose He has for our lives.  Walk the journey of despair, confusion, and lifes altering circumstances within On My Way to Heaven.   Envision how God allows adversities and people to walk in and out of our lives to assist in our preparation. As we learn life lessons, we should embrace forgiveness and learn how to become better instead of bitter.  Once this is achieved, a place of peace will be upon you. And Jesus said to Paul, But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.      (Acts 26:16)  As Jesus spoke to Paul on his Journey to Damascus, he speaks to us today." />
