  <title>You Can’T Walk in What You Believe Until You Change the Way You Think - Michael Truss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Satan has placed highly trained and skilled taskmasters over you to afflict many with pain, low self-esteem, and a poverty mentality. A taskmaster is something or someone designed just for you, to keep you in bondage and an impoverished state of mind. The enemy wants to keep you immobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what you want to do and what you need to do, but you cant function, because the enemy has left you paralyzed. Even though you want to move, and even though you have the strength to move, a voice inside your head keeps talking to you. It keeps saying the same thing over and over again. That voice is designed to keep the cycle of bad thoughts in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we refuse to terminate the cycle and allow it to be passed down from generation to generation, you will keep producing stagnated, non-prospering offspring who will never progress in their spiritual walk. Thats why it is so important to renew our minds with right thinking.&lt;/p&gt;" />
