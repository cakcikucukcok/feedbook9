  <title>Following Jesus in Turbulent Times - Hikmat Kashouh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nations are haemorrhaging refugees around the world. How displaced peoples are treated is under constant scrutiny– whether in the UK, the USA, and Australia, or Turkey, Colombia, and Uganda.
How will the Church respond in these turbulent times?
Resurrection Church Beirut in Lebanon was a small church of around one hundred people who then welcomed refugees from Middle Eastern countries, sacrificially served those in need in their community and saw the kingdom of God come. Through Pastor Hikmat’s leadership over the last decade, Resurrection Church has grown to over two thousand believers and the emphasis he brought on disciple-making has resulted in the church currently having two hundred and seventy life groups.
Using his church’s powerful testimony, Pastor Hikmat Kashouh teaches us how to disciple refugees from Arab contexts. Jesus is drawing more and more people to himself in the Middle East through the ministry of churches like Resurrection Church in Lebanon, and through miraculous divine visitations of God. In this book the church has a resource to help love, serve and disciple refugees, equip emerging indigenous leaders and understand discipleship of people from non-Christian backgrounds." />
