  <title>The Dragon-Of-War - Pablo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Dragon-of-War is a story about the darkness that prevents us from uniting with one another to honor, trust, and obey the one true God. Selac, a young man, is called to expose this darkness so that he and others may understand what is hindering them from serving their purpose in life. Instinctively, he recoils from this calling because his personal belief of live-and-let-live counters mandating any behavior. Understanding the assertion that only by divine providence is anyone able to serve the one true God, Selac goes forth to grow in faith in order to accomplish his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a series of experiences he learns that there will be deterrents to performing his mission. Selac teams with young male and female troopers to assist him in accomplishing his purpose. The team learns that their youth has become a hindrance. The one who was expecting him was expecting more experienced individuals and a larger force. Together, the young team encounters established traditions and values that generate deviations to their course of action for witnessing about the truth. Selac and the team meet an individual who provides instructions that will keep them focused on their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focused on the true Rock of salvation, Selac and the team go forth to witness about the truth to both friendly and hostile audiences. Selac is accused of performing illegal acts that will endanger the unity of the Empire in which they are to assist. As such, the troop is now sought for imprisonment or destruction by the elites of the ruling social and religious classes. With that realization, the young team continues to adhere to the guidance of the Spirit of God to witness about the only begotten Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
