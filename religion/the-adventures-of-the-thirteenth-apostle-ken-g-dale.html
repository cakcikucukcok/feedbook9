  <title>The Adventures of the Thirteenth Apostle - Ken G. Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life was set in place and going well. I was slowly taking the lead in my fathers business, and it was growing beyond what he had planned or envisioned, with the two of us buying and selling whatever things were needed or in demand. Then the sale with my brothers in Jerusalem changed everything. Though I did not understand Jesus words, they somehow touched my heart, and I knew I would never be the same person I was before. After going home and selling all that I owned, and getting stuck with my best friend, we journeyed to Jerusalem. On the day we arrived, Jesus was being put to death. Words cant describe the sadness and loss I felt, not for what I gave up, but for what I had just lost. Then a clear voice called to me: Matthew, and I answered him, Yes, Jesus. He was waiting there for Justin and me to arrive so that He might invite us to do a mighty work for the kingdom of God. We learned things that gave us vision into the spirit realm, and taught us to see men as God sees us. Our vision and our spirits were often opened to see in the spirit, so all we could do was go forward; there is no going back for us anymore. For each of us, one of our greatest joys was when we told our families about Jesus and they found His love, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
