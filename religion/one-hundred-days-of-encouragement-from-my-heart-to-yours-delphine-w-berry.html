  <title>One Hundred Days of Encouragement from My Heart to Yours - Delphine W. Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through lifes ups and downs, we need words of encouragement to carry us throughwords to brighten our days and help us see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thankfully, God has provided His Word to give us the inspiration, nourishment, and truth that can show us the way forward on His path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;One Hundred Days of Encouragement from My Heart to Yours,&lt;/i&gt; author Delphine W. Berry shares a beautiful devotional that will both encourage and enlighten you. It urges you to trust in the Lord at all times and in every situation, and it will open your heart, mind, and spirit, drawing you nearer to God and to His will for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dont always understand why things happen the way that they do, but when we trust in the Lord and follow His direction, He will reveal His plan and purpose for our lives. As Proverbs 3:56 reminds us, Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
