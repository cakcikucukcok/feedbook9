  <title>Peace of the Mind - D. J. Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peace of the Mind is D.J. Blues follow-up to 2005s The Good Life Chronicles.  Once again, he covers a wide array of topics, this time including several chapters on Christian spirituality. Included among them: an in-depth analysis of the Bible, covering questions answered as well as questions raised while reading the Bible; the debate between Catholics and Protestants on different spiritual issues is discussed; and Rick Warrens best-selling spiritual book The Purpose Driven Life is also reviewed, including eerie parallels to topics brought up in The Good Life Chronicles. Readers of that preceding book will recognize other familiar topics:  the annual Taconite Trophy Classic continues to be immortalized via the written word, as each years golf tournament has been chronicled herein; the fourth installment chapter on women, always popular yet provocative with the female crowd, is included; and a complete Seinfeld episodic list (partially referenced in the previous book) is now given its just duethe entire classic series is reviewed, episode by episode. This is just a sample of the various topics and experiences covered.  Peace of the Mind concludes the Thousand Page Trilogy with an overall introspective and occasionally subtle spiritual theme running through many of the chapters, reflecting the accomplishments, the struggles and the aspirations of life itself." />
