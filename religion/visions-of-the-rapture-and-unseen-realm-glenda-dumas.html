  <title>Visions of the Rapture and Unseen Realm - Glenda Dumas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lord shall descend from heaven with the voice of the archangel. The angel that I saw may be Michael. Michael and Gabriel are the only archangels that are mentioned in the Bible. Michael appears to have a key role in the end-time plan of God. Therefore, it may be a strong guess that Michael is the angel that I saw and communicated with about the Rapture. I also have a special message for gang members, drug abusers, adults, teenagers, and the youth. I wrote my visions down for you to know what is out there waiting for you on the other side of the veil. I peeped over and saw some things that were good and witnessed a horror that was beyond my wildest dreams. Most of you have not read the Bible, and a number of you who have, act as though you have forgotten what is in it. I often encounter people, old and young, who say that they cant understand the Bible. Therefore, I use a number of verses that are taken directly from the Bible to support the visions that I have seen. I am doing this purposely to acquaint you with a book that you all know but very seldom pick up to read. Hopefully, it will be a reminder that the Bible is inclusive of everything from the beginning of time to the end. Most of these Bible verses are self-explanatory." />
