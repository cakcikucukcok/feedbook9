  <title>Every Tribe and Tongue: A Biblical Vision for Language in Society - Michael Pasquale, Nathan L. K. Bierma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Tribe and Tongue offers a way, first, to rediscover biblical stories and principles that relate to questions about immigration and societal multilingualism, and, second, to outline possible ways to guide thoughtful engagement in the discourse of the public square based on the biblical witness. We will try to show that, far from being an afterthought in the Bible, the call to love our neighbors and to gather people of every nation together in the worship of God is at the very core of the gospel message.  Two powerful passions animate this book from beginning to end. First, this work is saturated in a deeply rooted love of the diversity of human languages that are one of God&#39;s gracious gifts to human beings. Second, this book is dedicated to calling the North American church to take seriously its charge not simply to love the stranger and alien but to live as strangers and aliens within the American nation to which it has been called to witness to Jesus Christ." />
