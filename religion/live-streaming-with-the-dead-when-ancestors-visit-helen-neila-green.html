The pictorial evidence presented of ancestral communication is real. All the characters are real people, and the scenarios are based on actual occurrences. Ancestral communication has taken place while this book was being written, and in a manner of speaking, such a phenomenon can perhaps be viewed as a form of live-streaming with the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Music forms an essential part of what is termed the spiritual investigation process discussed throughout this book. Each song or piece of musicor, in a number of cases, the lyrics, which are filled with messagesthat has been quoted is relevant to the story with respect to the band or to the artist. The music also encourages the reader to tune in to the mental power of sound, thus demonstrating that the power of sound, although not expressed out loud as such, enables an additional medium to be utilized so that we may explore an added dimension, as it were, in awakening the readers mental audio faculties.&lt;/p&gt;" />
