  <title>Being and Creation in the Theology of John Scottus Eriugena: An Approach to a New Way of Thinking - Sergei N. Sushkov, David Jasper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite his prominent role in the formation of Christian thought, John Scottus Eriugena still remains an enigmatic figure whose background and potential arouse a great deal of scholarly interest. This is true especially today, when faith seeks to regenerate: his honesty and profundity encourage us in our search for the authentic teaching of Christ. As a theologian who strongly believes in human dignity as equal to that of the imago dei, Eriugena helps us meet Christ again and follow him towards a new horizon of being. What makes Eriugena&#39;s theology unique is his innovative approach to theological thinking, which is to be properly understood, as argued in this book, in terms of the paradigmatic shift from metaphysics to dialectic. The way we think, while trying to adopt and follow the truth of revelation so as to get freed from the world of finite things, cannot actually dispense with a dialectical treatment of contradiction. And Eriugena is explicit about this, which allows him to win a reputation as the &quot;Hegel of the ninth century&quot; and to make us look at our faith anew in coherence with such pivotal ideas as the divine unity, right reason, and return to the reality of creation." />
