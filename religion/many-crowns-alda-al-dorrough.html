  <title>Many Crowns - Alda (Al) Dorrough</title>

I was very much amazed at how many crowns a king owned and actually wore. I suppose I always thought a king had only one crown, made of gold and precious gems and stones of all sorts. We saw many crowns of King Ludwig arranged neatly in his dressing room. There was one for formal wear, with gold, diamonds, and other jewels; one for sporting events; one for work; one for recreation; and even one for bedtime. Each one was carefully labeled for its purpose." />
