  <title>New York City Becomes the Capital of the New World Order - Apostle Frederick E. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the (33nd) thirty-second Book which we, F &amp; S F Ministry for JESUS, have written. All of the books that we have written was a result of God giving us   revelation  (prophecy, words of knowledge and words of wisdom). After God would give us this revelation, He would tell us to write a book of it and reveal it to the world. This Book, New York City Becomes The Capital Of The New World Order, has likewise, been written after revelation from God and by direction from God to write it and reveal it to the world.
In this Book we provide you with the prophecies that God gave us on December 2, 1999, with revelation that He has given us in the past. This provides a clear picture of the establishment of the New World Order and the dismantling of the New World Order. This is a very important Book. We are sure that your eyes will be opened to the future like never before. We show New York Citys role in New World Order.  We show the United States role in the New World Order. We provide you with the name of the most important people in the New World Order. Much, very much more, we provide." />
