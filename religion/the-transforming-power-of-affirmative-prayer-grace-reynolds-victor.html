  <title>The Transforming Power of Affirmative Prayer - Grace Reynolds Victor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book has arrived on this planet on a Divine time and fashion. Its arrival aligns with the birthing of our New World of light. This is a brilliant and complete guide that supports us in our spiritual work to manifesting this shift to our greater selves. This book is profoundly relevant at such a time as this! &lt;br /&gt;
Rev.A Peazer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a global call for the Spiritual transformation of people everywhere. We cannot deny that there is a major shift in the consciousness of the human race. This book is written with love as a tool for transformation one mind, one heart one soul at a time; it is suitable as a counseling tool, Clergy use, and for individual, family and group edification. It offers support through practical wisdom to transform the reader into an empowered being. It offers light for the overcoming of lack, fears, doubt, mediocrity, addictions, relationship and parenting issues, illness, work, self-sabotage and stagnation. It also offers support to those desiring to live their purpose in wholeness and elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author uses her experience of feeling pain when she mistakenly thought that she was injured. When she realized that she was not injured the pain stopped instantly! This serves to inspire readers to observe how their own thoughts affect their lives and to become aware of the relationship between mind and matter. The reader is lovingly supported through each step while their thought pattern becomes affirmatively reprogramed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trust that you realize that as your mind is renewed you become transformed. You will also realize that you can heal, prosper, and find peace and joy beyond your fondest imagination. I pray that as you practice these principles you can say with authority, The yoke of Affirmative prayer is easy and its burden is light beloveds, There is Transforming power in Affirmative prayer.It works when You work It!&lt;/p&gt;" />
