  <title>Christian Meat for Christian Muscles - Sandtorock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part 2 is here. This is the second installment of topics in the Christian Meat for Christian Muscles series; especially designed to pack more nutrition per page to those meat loving Christian readers and thinkers who devoured Part 1, and who want to live in God&#39;s perfect will.
Continuing with the underlying premise that Strength in the Lord is essential for successful Christian living, we target more areas of our lives that can benefit from the spiritual nutrition that is ours through Jesus Christ. We trust all our readers are tasting more of His victory in their lives, and we boldly make this faith filled prediction:
The battle to stop us from becoming better Christians is raging in vain. We are becoming stronger in the Lord and His power every day. The confidence and joy that comes with developing bigger Christian muscles is overflowing. We use this strength to fight the good fight, to gladly give to our poor brother, to compassionately forgive our weak brother, to lovingly serve our Big Brother; and as a community of brothers in Christ, we are growing to successfully live in God&#39;s perfect will.
