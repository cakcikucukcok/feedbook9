  <title>Narratives of the Earthly Ministry of Jesus of Nazareth - Del Mueller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have been with Jesus as he traveled about the Holy Land; to have observed the people he helped; the miracles he performed; the teachings he proclaimed; the problems he faced? Then, imagine how you would have reacted when a storm suddenly and without warning began to lash against your boat while Jesus slept; or when you were miraculously cured of leprously; could see again, could hear again, could talk again, could walk again.
&lt;p&gt;
Del Mueller takes readers into the thoughts and hearts of the key witnesses to Christs three year earthly ministry. He writes first-person accounts that provide readers with a unique historical perspective of the stories as they really could have happened. Narratives of the Earthly Ministry of Jesus of Nazareth will personalize the events that transformed the world and show readers the humanness of those who were changed because of Jesus.&lt;br&gt;" />
