  <title>Chasing Shadows - Sue Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It is often said life is at its cruelest when a parent outlives his or her child. As unnatural as that may seem, many parents find themselves in that position. Whether caused by disease, illness, accident, crime, or suicide, parents can find themselves making funeral arrangements rather than planning a childs birthday party, graduation, or wedding.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Author Sue Parker knows firsthand what that is like. In &lt;i&gt;Chasing Shadows: A Mothers Attempt to Process Her Grief&lt;/i&gt;, Parker shares her experiences after the death of her youngest child. For much of 2012, Rowan said he wouldnt live to see 2013. After all, the Mayan calendar ended on December 22, 2012, so he reckoned everyone was going to die. Rather than dwell on the negativity, he grabbed every opportunity with enormous enthusiasm, including a quad bike ride that cost him his life on Boxing Day. Bereft, heartbroken, in a state of total shock, and struggling to survive, Parker felt she had two choices. She could follow him over a cliff or try to make some sense of the tragic turn her familys lives had taken.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Everyones experiences are different, but in &lt;i&gt;Chasing Shadows: A Mothers Attempt to Process Her Grief&lt;/i&gt;, those going through similar circumstances may find help in knowing what to do nexthow to go forward. Youll discover the path forward is not always easy, and there will likely be times when you find yourself wondering, &lt;i&gt;Why bother?&lt;/i&gt; Through her experience, Parker shows you can go on, and you should.&lt;/P&gt;" />
