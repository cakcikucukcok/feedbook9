      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the last hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever given a deep thought about the end of our human civilization and the world? Have you ever asked if the end-time events predicted in the Bible will happen literally? Will hundreds of millions of Christians really disappear from the face of the earth one day at the same time? Will the deluge of cataclysmic upheavals resulting from the great tribulation happen literally? Will Jesus return to this earth and walk the streets of Jerusalem for the second time? How much time do we have left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fascinating book has pulled together the pieces of the puzzle into a simplified end-time event map in chronological order. You will discover for yourself that the handwriting on the wall is unmistakable; this is the earths final moments. You will learn how to get on Christs ark of salvation and how to escape the coming judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read the pages of this book, God will speak to your heart and give you insight beyond what words can express. Your life will be radically changed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
