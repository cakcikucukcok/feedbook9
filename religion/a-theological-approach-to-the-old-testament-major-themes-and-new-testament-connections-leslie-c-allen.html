  <title>A Theological Approach to the Old Testament: Major Themes and New Testament Connections - Leslie C. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Old Testament has two great themes: creation and covenant. They embrace subthemes: wisdom in the case of creation; Israel&#39;s religion and the Davidic covenant under the general umbrella of covenant; and internationalism, which mostly develops the theme of covenant and partly the theme of creation.  These topics cluster around a common center: Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament. This God is portrayed in different roles, which have attached to them role expectations for both Yahweh and those with whom he assumes relationship. Through contextual exegesis of key texts, we come to understand these roles and associated themes.  While the Old Testament has its own distinctive contributions to make to divine revelation, much of its material is reused in the New Testament to explain and validate the New Testament message. By concentrating on the Old Testament, we learn to appreciate the enormous debt the New Testament owes to the Old in clarifying New Testament theological and moral perspectives." />

    	<p>The Old Testament has two great themes: creation and covenant. They embrace subthemes: wisdom in the case of creation; Israel's religion and the Davidic covenant under the general umbrella of covenant; and internationalism, which mostly develops the theme of covenant and partly the theme of creation. These topics cluster around a common center: Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament. This God is portrayed in different roles, which have attached to them role expectations for both Yahweh and those with whom he assumes relationship. Through contextual exegesis of key texts, we come to understand these roles and associated themes. While the Old Testament has its own distinctive contributions to make to divine revelation, much of its material is reused in the New Testament to explain and validate the New Testament message. By concentrating on the Old Testament, we learn to appreciate the enormous debt the New Testament owes to the Old in clarifying New Testament theological and moral perspectives.</p>
