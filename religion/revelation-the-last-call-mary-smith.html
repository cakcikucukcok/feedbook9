  <title>Revelation: the Last Call - Mary Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Revelation was given to us by Jesus Himself, so that we can be sure of the rest of the story. He loved all of us SO much, He died and rose again to save us. He is here, in every progression of the end of time, offering His personal invitation to repent and accept salvation; it is the Last Call. In our world of mistrust, violence, pain and tears, He is here offering relief from all of it; He is completely trustworthy to complete it. Revelation has a very simple message for each one of us: Repent and accept Jesus as Savior, and spend eternity in a wonderful, spectacular City of God where the Tree of Life sustains us.&lt;br /&gt;
The Last Call is a gripping interpretation of the last book of the Bible. It simplifies the message of a portion of Scripture that is daunting and confusing to many Christians. It offers a stirring call to believers and nonbelievers alike to come to terms with the earth-shaking events portrayed in the Apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;
