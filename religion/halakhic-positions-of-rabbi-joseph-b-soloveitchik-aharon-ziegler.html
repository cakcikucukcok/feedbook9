  <title>Halakhic Positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik - Aharon Ziegler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;Halakhic Positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik&lt;/i&gt;, insights into Jewish law from the preeminent figure of twentieth-century modern Orthodoxy are presented in a clear and concise manner. Commonly known as &quot;the Rav,&quot; Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, zt&quot;l, has stimulated and influenced the intellectual mind and touched the sensitive hearts of thousands of people. While he was not necessarily known as a decisor, or &lt;i&gt;poseik&lt;/i&gt;, of halakha, he was widely recognized as an individual who had the uncanny ability to conceptualize the spirit of Jewish law on a universal level. Throughout his lifetime, the Rav published few works, transmitting his Torah knowledge through classes and lectures instead. As a student of Rabbi Soloveitchik for many years, Rabbi Aharon Ziegler accumulated a vast library of notes and tapes on the Rav&#39;s halakhot. In this volume he shares the Rav&#39;s unique and perhaps lesser known halakhic positions on a wide range of topics." />
