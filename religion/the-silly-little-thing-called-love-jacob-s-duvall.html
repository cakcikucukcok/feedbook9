  <title>The Silly Little Thing Called Love - Jacob S. Duvall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a world that sells the idea of fairy tales and happily ever afters, many of us spend our dating lives looking for our Prince Charmings or Cinderellas. The first blush of a new romance can make things seem perfect. Then reality eventually enters the picture, and we are forced to realize that more often than not, we end up with happily never afters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Silly Little Thing Called Love, author Jacob S. Duvall guides you through the tactics to start with a good dating life and end with a great marital life. Youll learn to understand the importance of a solid commitment to God and how it relates to your everyday relationships. Discover how to form a mind-set that helps you become the right one rather than continually looking for the right one. Most of all, Duvall shows how important it is to rethink what culture has taught you about relationships and refocus instead on what Christ has to say about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living a Christ-filled life does not mean you cant have an active dating life. But in The Silly Little Thing Called Love, youll learn how to spend that time developing the skills needed for a true happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;" />
