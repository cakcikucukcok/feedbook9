  <title>Journeys into the Heart - Drunvalo Melchizedek, Daniel Mitel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Moving into the Heart 
There is movement associated with entering the sacred space of the heart. Without this movement, your brain only imagines that you are in the sacred space of the heart, but this is not true. In Journeys into the Heart, you will find exercises that show you how to move your spirit there. If you have never done this before, it may seem a little strange, but you will get it. 
The master authorized to guide you into your heart is the spirit behind the eyes reading these words now. That is you. 
Read and enjoy practicing and applying all the methods we offer you. Decide the appropriate one for you. Then practice, practice, and practice again, and remember who you really are. 
Last, read about our experiences entering the heart, about the prayer of the heart, and living in the heart. You might find them very helpful on your own spiritual journey. 
Remember, you and I are alike. I am you and you are me.
