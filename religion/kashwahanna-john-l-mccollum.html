  <title>Kashwahanna - John L. McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kashwahanna is Maya; meaning: As above so below.
When the Soul is under the infl uence of the minds
eye then through the sixth sense the Being becomes one
with Infi nite Intelligence. Kashwahanna takes the reader
back to the time of Enoch and the Origination of Mysticism
and then comes forward detailing from ancient texts how
mysticism has progressed through the ages up to present time.
It incorporates ancient civilizations throughout the world
and how mysticism has played a part in the development of
their societies. It correlates the Maya, Egyptian and Native
American Indians as to the similarities from ancient times to
present times, while incorporating the Hermetic, Esoteric,
Exoteric and Gnostic forms of expression into every day and
understandable terminology. This book goes into detail on two
different mystical experiments that the reader can perform in
the privacy of their own home that provides a way for the
seeker to prove or disprove what they are being told. People
in the world are searching for something more than what they
have received from Religion and the wisdom of the world.
Many people are seeking these answers and not really fi nding
them. It is my hope and belief that this book will put all seekers
on the path to understanding the difference between the Soul
Personality and their Ancient Being, as well as a truth for
them to believe in and live by." />
