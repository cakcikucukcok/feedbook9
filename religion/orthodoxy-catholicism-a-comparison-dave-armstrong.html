  <title>Orthodoxy &amp; Catholicism: A Comparison - Dave Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has been my strong desire for some time now to revise my book in order to emphasize ecumenism and unity proportionately a lot more than in the first (2004) edition. I&#39;m much more interested in finding common ground. I&#39;ve also learned a thing or two about Orthodoxy over the past decade. I wanted this volume to be able to read by Orthodox and also Eastern Catholics, without having seizures or going into apoplectic fits (caused by my ignorance or overly polemical or biased writing). I exaggerate, of course, but perhaps not by much! Toward that end I have enlisted a very qualified Eastern Catholic friend to contribute significant portions to the revised edition: Fr. Deacon Daniel G. Dozier. The revision remains an apologetic for Catholicism and respectful critique of Orthodoxy, but now it also includes friendly ecumenical discussion and dialogue: feedback and input from the Eastern theological perspective. The overall tone, tenor, and goal is considerably different. Unity is stressed as much as apologetics." />
