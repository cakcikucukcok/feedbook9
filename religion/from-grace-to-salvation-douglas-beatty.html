  <title>From Grace to Salvation - Douglas Beatty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning God create Heaven and Earth. God created man, and placed him in the Garden of Eden. It is here man commits his first sin, as Adam and Eve disobey God, by eating from the tree of knowledge. Therefore, God removed them from the Garden. Man commits another sin through Cain, when he killed his brother Able. The years pass and man had become so corrupt, that God destroyed all his creation, with a great flood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Through Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Isaac God shows his love for man. Again, by returning to the life of sin, man has rebelled Gods love and mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the years pass, the Eastern world has fallen under the ruling of the Roman Empire. The safety of the Roman Army became a comfort to the Jews. Yet, this safety came with a high price, there came slavery, injustice and immorality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Between the laws of the Roman Empire and the laws of the Church, the Jewish people were confused. When one would show denial to the laws of the Roman Empire the punishment was death. With the Church it was the same. As one would show denial to the laws of the Church the punishment was death. This made it rough on the Jewish people, for what was right with one law, was wrong in the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From generation to generation the word had been passed down that a Messiah was coming to rule over them forever, and ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this book we will read how God brought two people together to fore fill his promise to the Prophets, to send a Messiah to change the hearts of man, and for man to be forgiven of his sins, forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Remember this as you go through life. With God nothing shall be impossible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-MEN&lt;/p&gt;" />
