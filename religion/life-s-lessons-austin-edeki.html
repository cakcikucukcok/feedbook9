  <title>Life’S Lessons - Austin Edeki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a journey, and within the journey, there is a race, and in the race, there are lanes. Every man has his lane where he runs his race. If you run your race on someone elses lane, he determines how much you are paid, how you spend your time, and when you spend it. Everyone has an arrival time that is unique to their race. My arrival time may not be your arrival time, but that doesnt mean I wont arrive. We are all wired differently. You may be wired to kill Goliath, but I am wired to build the temple. You may be wired to be the next king, but I am wired to anoint the king for endorsement. Every destiny on the face of the earth is important, and there is a connection.
You will learn the following: 
what the journey is all about and how to recognize it 
the race of life and how to recognize when youre running on someone elses lane 
how to switch to your lane and run your race successfully 
who the master over your life is and how to exit the wrong master 
how to discern moments and seasons 
how to understand and recognize the spirit of Eli 
how to make choices and stay committed to them 
how to maximize the spoon you were born with and how to use it to your benefit in the marketplace 
how to create an environment of success" />
