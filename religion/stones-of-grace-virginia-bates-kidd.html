  <title>Stones of Grace - Virginia Bates Kidd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intrigued by the piles of stones, rocks, and boulders that cover the landscape of the Holy Land, author Virginia Bates Kidd begins a deeper quest for a pattern within these emblems. As she journeys through the Scriptures, Kidd discovers how God transformed these simple facets of nature into timeless messages of love and grace, building onto a wide gamut of human emotions to reach the deepest recesses of our hearts. 
Kidd sprinkles pebbles of her own imagination onto familiar stories: the clink of stone upon stone resounds with startling life while Abraham builds his altar with Stones of Sorrow. The stones beneath the feet of the adulterous woman roll with a life of their own as she walks away from the temple. The trajectory of The First Stone is infused with the jealousy that drove Cains hand to murder. Pride and ambition pile up the bricks of the Tower of Babel, and Stones of Courage shows the earth shaking under a giants armor-clad weight, while David prevails with large faith and small stones. 
Throughout her exploration, Kidd winds down each story with a heartfelt devotion. She hopes these biblical stories will stir your imagination and warm your heart. Says Kidd: Seek your own concordance and go to work. Gods Word is a precious jewel, and He wants to enrich your life withit." />
