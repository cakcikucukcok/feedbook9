  <title>All the King&#39;s Orphans - Lynette Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I was asked to edit All the King&#39;s Orphans, I was honored, as I always am to do this work. Little did I know so much of the book would apply to me! Along the way, I started reading for what I could glean from the expansive knowledge contained in these pages. It explained so much about myself and why I do some of the things I do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those books whose pages will be underlined, highlighted, dog-eared, and coffee stained. If you do not find yourself in these pages, then you will learn how to love others who operate from an orphan frame of mind. So thankful for this book and Lynette&#39;s courage to write it. Sheila Harper, author of  Survivor: A Journey Through Abortion and Back; founder and president of SaveOne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Why am I different? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I belong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I get in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is my purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the questions that plague many followers of Jesus. Though adopted into His kingdom, millions still carry the spirit of an orphanunwilling or unable to see themselves as true sons and daughters of the King of Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orphan spirit manifests itself in various ways, but our Abba invites us to live free of care in the security of knowing who we are in Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
