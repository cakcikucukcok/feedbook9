  <title>I^2 - John Matthew Kilpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First, let me start out by saying i2 is built upon Biblical principals. i2 was built with the intention of growing you into the person that God intended for you to be. Biblical characters and stories are where the strategies that inspired i2 are rooted. Even if you do not believe as we do, these strategies work. 
Each of our 5-week programs are built on the following facts: there is a God, He built you for a purpose and within that purpose lies fulfillment. Our information has come from the teachings of His word, the example of His son, Jesus Christ, and the testimony of our lives. Even if accepting that is a challenge, my hope is that you are willing at least to peak under the hood and see for yourself. 
Freedom begins by calling out exactly what is weighing you down physically, mentally and spiritually. Each chapter will guide you closer towards Intentional Independence, or as we like to call it, i2. Now, lets find out what freedom really looks like! Lift anchor!
