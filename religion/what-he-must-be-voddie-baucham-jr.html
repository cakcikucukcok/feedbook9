  <title>What He Must Be - Voddie Baucham Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All parents want their daughters to marry godly young men. But which qualities, specifically, should they be looking for?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will you say when that certain young man sits down in your living room, sweaty-palmed and tongue-tied, and asks your permission to marry your daughter? What criteria should he meet before the two of them join together for life? &lt;em&gt;What He Must Be&amp;hellip; If He Wants to Marry My Daughter&lt;/em&gt; outlines ten qualities parents should look for in a son-in-law, including trustworthiness, a willingness to lead his family, an understanding of his wife&#39;s role, and various spiritual leadership qualities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author Voddie Baucham follows up on his popular book &lt;em&gt;Family Driven Faith&lt;/em&gt; with this compelling apologetic of biblical manhood. By studying the principles outlined in his book, parents who want their daughter to marry a godly man-as well as those who want their sons to become godly men-will be well equipped to help their children look for and develop these God-honoring qualities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
