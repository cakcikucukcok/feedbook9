  <title>Kierkegaard&#39;s Theology of Encounter - David Lappano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Søren Kierkegaard&#39;s Theology of Encounter provides a theoretical framework that brings the unity of Kierkegaard&#39;s &#39;middle period&#39; into relief. David Lappano analyses Kierkegaard&#39;s writings between 1846 and 1852 when the socially constructive dimension of his thought comes to prominence, involving two dialectical aspects of religiousness identified by Kierkegaard: they are the edifying and the polemical. How these come together and get worked out in the
lives of individuals form the basis of what can be called a Kierkegaardian &#39;social praxis&#39;. Lappano argues that the tension between the edifying and the polemical can be coherently maintained in a communicative life that is also characteristic of a militant faith. This militant faith and life is presented as a
critical guard against absolutisms, fundamentalisms, and intellectual aloofness; but the &#39;militant&#39; individual is also utterly dependent, in need of edification and critique, and therefore chooses the risk of encountering others, seeking relationships out of a commitment to the development of people and communities in co-operation. Therefore, not only does this dialectic provide readers with an important theoretical framework for understanding Kierkegaard&#39;s &#39;middle period&#39;, it is also a
valuable resource for a constructive analysis of active social living suitable for theology in the twenty-first century." />
