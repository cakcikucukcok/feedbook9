  <title>The Rapture 2028: America’S Countdown to Apocalypse! - David Netherton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Shocking Bible Discovery found in the Dead Sea Scrolls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After forty years of research in the Biblical text, this book came about while studying Biblical manuscripts in their original Greek. I was given a project by my Greek professor to research the Dead Sea Scrolls. This research changed my life, my belief about time and the books of the Bible. While researching the Dead Sea Scrolls, I found two historical books that were in the Bible during Jesus time on this Earth. So I ask this question: Why did man remove these books? The deeper I studied I discovered that our Bible should have seventy books instead of sixty-six. Six is the number of man and a number representing incompletion. Sixty-six doubles its meaning, and the number 666 needs no explanations. Men do resist Gods will today (2 Peter 3:9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching the subject I encountered extreme opposition. The books of the Bible should be divisible by seven. So, we are missing one New Testament book and three Old Testament books to make a seventy book Bible. Have we been deceived by our religious leaders and science community? Does all time truly consist in a 7,007-year window?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written from the complete seventy-book Bible which was revealed in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Do the scrolls reveal angels mating with the daughters of Adam? Where did the giant human originate? Have we all been lied to about Genesis 6 and the events during the days of Noah? Are angels and demons masquerading as aliens and UFOs in a great end of time deception? Will the dollar collapse by 2022? Will the U.S. be destroyed in one day by 2028?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come, (John 16:13-14).&lt;/p&gt;" />
