      <meta name="description" content="From the pen of Charles Spurgeon:This year we will gather heavenly fruit on earthly ground, where faith and hope have turned the desert into the Lord’s garden. If “men ate the bread of angels” (Ps. 78:25) long ago, why not today?

Charles Haddon Spurgeon was known as the Prince of Preachers, stirring audiences from his London pulpit from 1854 to 1892. Millions more who never heard him preach read his weekly sermons.

Look Unto Me offers 366 of Spurgeon’s most powerful devotions, modernizing the language without changing the meaning and adding Scripture references and quotes in the NIV. Jim Reimann, editor of updated editions of Streams in the Desert and My Utmost for His Highest, has also added thought-provoking comments to deepen your understanding of the text, other Scriptures to consider, as well as application and closing prayers. This new edition also includes these new features:• Scripture quotes referenced in the context of each devotion• Scripture and subject indexes• Hymn quotes referenced with composer names and datesThe material is profound, thought-provoking, and life-changing, but easy to follow. With Scripture references from literally every book of the Bible, this is the perfect book to help you dig deeper into God’s Word and be challenged to expand your faith. If you long for a deeper walk with Christ and a richer understanding of the Christian faith that can be applied to everyday living, Look Unto Me is the devotional you’ve been waiting for." />
