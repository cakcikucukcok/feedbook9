  <title>Adventures of a Country Boy in the City - Oluwole Komolafe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adventures of a Country Boy in the City&lt;br&gt;
provides an insight into the engaging life of the author, whose natural instinct is to know how to convert opportunities to bring about positive changes in his life. The author enchants the imagination of his readers to become part of his compelling story by involving the reader in every step of the adventures he encountered in the city of Lagos, and later, as a student, in the cities of Hamburg and of West Berlin.&lt;p&gt;
Told in very colorful and vibrant language, the reader, the author and the story all become one and the same entity, allegorically following the path etched out in the words of the author. When, in his journeys, and one road seemed to be closed and the reader shudders at the rational of the breathtaking risk that the author has just taken, a God-sent Guiding Angel suddenly appears to take the author out of whatever adversity.&lt;p&gt;
Join Komolafe in his adventures as he journeys through life from the background of a simple village life in the Yoruba Kingdom of Nigeria to the world of opportunities that awaits a man of valor who dares to demand his share of what destiny has in stock for him." />
