They had nothing in common.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;As for God, well, God wasGod! And what could be better than &lt;I&gt;that&lt;/I&gt;? Being God was &lt;I&gt;everything&lt;/I&gt; that represented good, including, of course, sex.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;And sex? Well, sex was just sex. It was fun. But mostly it was an essential procreative aspect of life. Under &lt;I&gt;appropriate&lt;/I&gt; terms, and in &lt;I&gt;specific&lt;/I&gt; settings, it could be a fairly wondrous thing, to explore, to appreciate, but the terms were usually, and most relevantly, &lt;I&gt;within&lt;/I&gt; the strict context of marriage, or, at the very least, in that of a deeply committed relationship.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Further terms included appropriateness of time and consumption, adherence to specific sexual patterns, restrictions in sexual thought, and much more. After &lt;I&gt;all terms are met&lt;/I&gt;, one might then feel free to break off a little for himself, from time to time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Okay.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;All of that was in a past life that I used to live.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;No more.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I had practiced what one might call oops, excuse me sex most of my young life, and deeply into my middle adult life too. Having recognized that I did not seem to possess the virtues and attributes of a priest, or a monk, I subtly took care of my sexual needs and expressions in the quickest and most expedient fashion possible, so that I could  and I might add, with &lt;I&gt;rapidity&lt;/I&gt;  get back to put more important matters back in hand.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;No idea whatsoever was given to the fact that the celebration of sexual expression was an integral feature of those important matters.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;But, hey wait a minute! Sex is of the utmost importance to most every one of us! Where would we be, in fact, without it? We need it. We not only &lt;I&gt;need&lt;/I&gt; it, we &lt;I&gt;want&lt;/I&gt; it. Its good for us. Is this not true?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;So, here you have a different kind of perspective on certain things in life. As you read the book, see how it compares with what &lt;I&gt;you&lt;/I&gt; think!&lt;/P&gt;" />
