  <title>Prayers to the God of My Life: Psalms for Morning and Evening - Lisa B. Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Psalms have long been a staple in the devotional life of religious people. Composed thousands of years ago, they bring every emotion known to humankind-from anger to adoration-into the presence of God.  In many monastic traditions all 150 Psalms are prayed each week. But those who live outside the cloister, even if they love the Psalms, would find such a schedule difficult to maintain. In Prayers to the God of My Life, Lisa Hamilton provides small portions for daily reading each morning and evening for 365 days of the year.   Matched both to nature&#39;s seasonal cycle of the year and the church&#39;s liturgical calendar, these Psalm fragments invite us to focus on all aspects of our relationship with God: praise, trust, fearfulness, pain, confession, thanksgiving, longing, the need for guidance, and more. A question worthy of reflection or a suggested action accompanies each selection. The Psalm translation is from the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer. Excellent for use as a daily devotional, a companion to fixed-hour prayer, or for use by groups." />
