  <title>Who...Not What Is the Word of God?: And Why It Matters - Nicola J. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you know every &quot;Word of God&quot; Scripture in the New Testament refers to Jesus Christ or the Gospel of Grace! However, this book isn&#39;t about terminology, it&#39;s about power. The Bible includes both the law and the Gospel of Grace. The Scripture says the strength of sin is the law and the Gospel is the power of God.  Only the Gospel of Grace (not the law) empowers us and is God&#39;s living &quot;Word&quot; to us today.   You will discover:  1. Why our &quot;Word of God&quot; terminology matters. 2. How the Scripture uses the term &quot;Word of God.&quot; 3. The crucial difference between God-breathed and God-spoken. 4. How the early church used the Scripture. 5. Why Jesus used the term &quot;Word of God&quot; only with Pharisees 6. Why the law is spiritual and causes us to sin. 7. How to access the very real power to do right 8. Why God thinks you&#39;re perfect...just as you are!.  Using the term &quot;Word of God&quot; in accordance with Scripture will;  1. Help us hear God speak to us through our Bible.  2. Free us from the condemnation of the law.   3. Keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and all He did for us. 4. Remind us that we are righteous, holy, blameless and above reproach in our Father&#39;s eyes.  A list of every &quot;Word of God&quot; verse in the New Testament is included for personal study.   www.myperfectpeople.org" />
