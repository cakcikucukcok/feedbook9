  <title>The Alchemy of Prayer - Loretta M. Siani Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Alchemy of Prayer&lt;/i&gt; offers an eminently readable, step-by-step spiritual guide that puts the complex metaphysics of prayer taught in &lt;i&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/i&gt; into everyday terms. If youre skeptical about the power of prayer or have little faith
in the traditional Christian approach to prayer, this book is for you.&lt;p&gt;
Its central thesis is that prayer is not an act of communication that begins with us and ends with God, but rather that it is an act of communication that
begins with God and ends with us; were it not for this fact, wed be oblivious to prayer. Indeed, &lt;i&gt;The Alchemy of Prayer&lt;/i&gt; proposes that we were actually created out of prayer. The power surge that emanated out of Gods first prayer not only sparked us into existence; it forever established our minds as natural channels for receiving and sending His same kind of prayer. This explains why today, eons after creation, were still wired for prayer. Moreover, it also explains why prayers not modeled after Gods primal prayer seemingly go unanswered.&lt;p&gt;
All of this begs the question: how is it that weve forgotten how to pray the way God wired us to pray? How is it that the apple has fallen so far from the
tree?&lt;p&gt;
This intellectually engaging book seeks to answer these questions for you and aims to provoke a sea change in your fundamental thinking about the kind of God in which you believe, as well as what true prayer really is." />
