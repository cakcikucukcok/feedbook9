  <title>When in the Midst of a Spiritual Storm: Praise, Pray, and Persevere - Dianne E. Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a physical or spiritual storm? Well, they are both similar. A physical storm is whereas there are dark clouds, thunder and lightning and the sun refuse to shine. There is also rain, and I mean rain, rain, and then more rain. A spiritual storm has some of the same characteristics. The most highly visible difference is that soon the physical storm has passed. A spiritual storm, one may have to weather it much longer. It wont be over until God say that it is. During this time we must praise, pray, and persevere. This is the only way that we will be able to weather the storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in the Midst of a Spiritual Storm: Praise, Pray, and Persevere will open our minds to the spirituality of Gods work. Whenever we experience these storms God is doing a great work in us and he is taking us to another level in him. The author portrays some of the many storms that she has had to endure as well as those of some biblical characters, and others who she has had contact with. The author guarantees that you will be able to see yourself or those who are close to you in some of these storms. You will be able to also see how storms can be weathered with Gods assistance. There are many obstacles in weathering storms and many spiritual disciplines that we must acquire. It is my prayer that we can all learn from this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
