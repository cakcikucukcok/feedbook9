  <title>The Dance - Oriah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Dance,&lt;/em&gt; the wise and practical book that expands on Oriah Mountain Dreamer&#39;s new moving prose poem. In this compelling book the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Invitation&lt;/em&gt; challenges readers to live with passion, energy, and honesty. The key, says Oriah, is to savor the everyday world of family, friends, love, and work with clear minds and open hearts. When we are physically and emotionally stressed and our spirits are depleted, we must realize that happiness has not vanished but is buried beneath the clutter of our harried lives. With rare courage and honesty, Oriah unveils the challenge of her inspiring poem through compelling stories from her own experience, offering us tools to become fully the person we already are -- not ways to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&quot;To dance -- to live in a way that is consistent with our longing&quot; -- is to discover a gift that we can give ourselves again and again over a lifetime. To dance, alone or with others, is to be who we truly are as we fulfill our soul&#39;s desires. To do this, we must learn how to let go and slow down, returning to the sacred emptiness where we encounter our true self. Practical, inspiring, and profoundly illuminating, &lt;em&gt;The Dance&lt;/em&gt; is an invitation to discover a place of connection, serenity, and joy that is uniquely our own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
