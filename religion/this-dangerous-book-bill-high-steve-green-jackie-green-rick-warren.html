  <title>This Dangerous Book - Bill High, Steve Green, Jackie Green, Rick Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Steve and Jackie Green, founders and curators of the Museum of the Bible--a fascinating exploration of the history, authenticity, and power of the Bible, the book that has changed people and nations throughout the centuries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the top selling book in history. It brings social upheaval, international arguments, and political controversy. It has been used to justify both love and war. And for generations, it has found its way into the hearts of millions, offering comfort, direction, and life-changing truths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could one book have such power? In &lt;em&gt;This Dangerous Book, &lt;/em&gt;Steve and Jackie Green explore the incredible history and impact of the Bible. As the founders and visionaries of the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C., the Greens have a unique perspective on the Bible&#39;s journey--from its ancient beginnings, to its effect on the moral fiber of nations, to its transformative influence in individual hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greens share the challenges they have faced in acquiring biblical artifacts from around the world and why generations--in every time period and in every geographical location--have risked their lives to preserve this precious book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring ancient tablets, medieval commentaries, and modern translations, &lt;em&gt;This Dangerous Book &lt;/em&gt;offers fascinating insight into the miracles and martyrdoms that have led to the Scriptures we read today. The Greens explore how cutting-edge technology gives new insight into the authenticity of the Bible, including the work of fifty scholars who recently uncovered hidden details about thirteen unpublished Dead Sea Scroll fragments. &lt;em&gt;This Dangerous Book &lt;/em&gt;also looks at the link between the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, what we can learn from how the Bible was passed down to us, and why God&#39;s Word is foundational to America&#39;s past and crucial for its future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is a world-changer and a heart-changer. Whether you have read the Bible for years or are simply curious about its influence, &lt;em&gt;This Dangerous Book &lt;/em&gt;could change your heart as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
