  <title>The Franciscan Tradition: Franciscan Tradition - Regis   J. Armstrong, Ingrid J. Peterson, Phyllis Zagano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saint Francis of Assisi is one of the most beloved saints. His commitment to God&#39;s will, his yearning to embrace poverty, and his attentiveness to the Spirit&#39;s presence in his life continue to inspire Christians and non-Christians alike. &lt;i&gt;The Franciscan Tradition&lt;/i&gt; highlights some of the most influential people in Franciscan history. Using the writings of men and women from the First, Second, and Third Orders, this volume shows the breadth and depth of the Franciscan way of life. Presented here are saints and martyrs, contemplatives and preachers, theologians and reformers. They heeded God&#39;s call, found hope in Francis&#39; mission, and now provide wisdom for those who seek to follow God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regis J.
