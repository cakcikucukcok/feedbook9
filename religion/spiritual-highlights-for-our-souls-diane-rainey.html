  <title>Spiritual Highlights for Our Souls - Diane Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spiritual Highlights For Our Souls Book 2, was written to encourage us in fulfilling the calling on our lives. These highlights reflect Gods forever awareness, presence and power. 
Have you ever ask God the following questions: 
1. God, did you see that? 
2. God, did you plan for it to happen that way?. 
3. God, was it really necessary for me to go through all that? 
The answers to the above questions have not changed. God sees all, knows all and He has a master plan. 
When God created His master plan He knew that we would face challenges, but regardless of the challenges He expects for us to fulfill the calling on our lives. He expects for us to lean and depend upon Him only, to put all our trust in Him, for us to use our gifts/talents to help others and for us to advance His kingdom. 
Let us not just be hearers of the word, Let us also be doers!!!" />
