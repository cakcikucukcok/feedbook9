  <title>Nature, Rocks, and Minerals - Rick M. Streight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about our Creator and Salvation. The connection between the Bible and Nature [Gods Second Book] is best described in Job 12:8: Speak to the earth, and it will teach you. We Worship our Creator because we owe our Total life and existence to Him. Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and sea, and the fountains of waters (Revelation 14:7 KJV). He hath made the earth by His Power, He hath established the world by His Wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by His Discretion (Jeremiah 10:12). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Rick Streight wants everyone to know our Creator God values us far above diamonds, rubies, gold, or silver. Planet Earth was made just for us! Jesus gave his life on Calvary that we may have Forgiveness, Power, and Salvation. Read Isaiah 53:5 and 1 Peter 1:1819. If we love and trust God and are willing to submit to our Creator, Jesus says this, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me (Matthew 16:24). Then God promises this, I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir (Isaiah 13:12). O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker (Psalms 95:6). May we all start off every day with these thoughts: This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it (Psalms 118:24). God is reminding us to: Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. (Matthew 5:16).&lt;/p&gt;" />
