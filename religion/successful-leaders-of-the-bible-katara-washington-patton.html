      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The third book in a new series  bringing the experiences of favorite biblical figures to the challenges of contemporary life.      &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you could drop biblical men and women into our world today, what kind of lessons might they teach you? In SUCCESSFUL LEADERS OF THE BIBLE, the Bible&#39;s most exceptional leaders come alive in fictionalized form to help readers understand that the lessons God imparted in the Bible millennia ago are just as applicable today as they were then. For example, if David lived today and continued to chase after God, how might God help him rise to a position of great power just as he did eons ago? If Moses was alive, imagine how God might use him to advocate for others. These stories are perfect for those who want to better themselves and see biblical characters in a whole new light." />
