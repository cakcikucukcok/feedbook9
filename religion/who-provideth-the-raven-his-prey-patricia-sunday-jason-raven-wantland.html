  <title>Who Provideth the Raven His Prey? - Patricia Sunday, Jason “Raven” Wantland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two persons and one Ghost are involved in the writing of this book. One person was a teenager of 19 years named Raven who was a writer of poetry and homeless, downcast, and living on the streets of Louisiana. The second person was a woman of much greater years named Sunday who saw great potential in the Raven and wanted to help him. Then, there was the third person in this trinity who was a Ghost of ancient age who drew both of these persons together to accomplish this work of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demons, strait jackets and voices in his head had him on the run.  He masked his incredible growing pains and his unparalleled love for a girl in his poetry.  Vulgarities run amuck in a bit of the poetry, but the woman named Sunday chose to let them remain. Raven&#39;s rendition of his pain is told in one of the poems titled ... ...  ...  THE MASK:&lt;/p&gt;  
      &lt;br&gt;Condemned to violence, Arrested by pain
      &lt;br&gt;Inside this soul lies a man insane. 
      &lt;br&gt;Conceived to anger addicted to hate
      &lt;br&gt;A mutant child with a twisted fate.
      &lt;br&gt;A killer&#39;s smile with a psycho star dream
&lt;br&gt;Behind the mask things aren&#39;t what they seem.
      &lt;br&gt;Unholy soldier  -  Disciple of sin
      &lt;br&gt;That&#39;s the kind of life I&#39;m living in.
&lt;p&gt;This is a book that you can not put down. You have to read the whole input of this teenager. It is that intriguing, and that entertaining.  By the time you finish reading this book, hopefully, you will find yourself in love with this teenage young man but more importantly that you find and fall in love with his &#39;friendly&#39; Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
