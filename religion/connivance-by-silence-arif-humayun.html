  <title>Connivance by Silence - Arif Humayun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book covers several themes and many message to different groups of Muslims around the world. The underlying message is that under a defeatist mindset, Muslim scholars adopted politically expedient positions through fatwas many of which are contrary to the scripture. This was established through the Investigative Commision established in Pakistam in 1953-54. Their report documents this fact (covered in Chapter 6 and Appendix 2) and exposed the many inconsistencies in the radical&#39;s doctrine. The book essentially revolves around the findings of this report. The recent terrorist events in Europe and the US, and increasing radicalism in these societies, can all be traced to the findings of that report. The interconnection between the radicals&#39; doctrines and terrorist actions is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrorists and politicized clergy use those flawed interpretations to radicalize and recruit youngters to their cadres. Many Muslim scholars and leaders justify the terrorist strikes as retaliatory actions against the US or Western anti-Islamic policies. The only way to reverse this destructive trend is for Muslims to understand and reject the incorrect interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are consequences for Muslims living in non-Muslim countries because Muslim scholars and leaders testified that Muslims cannot be faithful citizens of a non-Muslim government. Europe has seen this trend and it is now starting in the US. The Muslims living in non-Muslim countries should clearly establish their loyalties. It is therefore imperative for Muslims to be clear that Islam requires them to be faithful to their country.&lt;/p&gt;
