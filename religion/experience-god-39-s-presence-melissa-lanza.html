  <title>Experience God&#39;s Presence - Melissa Lanza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book will teach a person how to connect, encounter and experience God inside the center of oneself, to experience God&amp;#39;s presence inside one&amp;#39;s own heart. What is God&amp;#39;s presence like? How do we get that water so that we will never be thirsty again? What is that water mentioned in the Bible in the story about the woman at the well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is that sacred space inside every human being that longs for the Divine, the spiritual part of our beings. It is the space where the human and Divine meet. It is the focal point where the soul and Divine become one. An amazing secret of the soul. You become what you behold. An experience like no other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience God&amp;#39;s Presence appeals to a wide audience. Members of churches in any denomination, used in prayer and fellowship groups, youth ministry, retreats, RCIA, spirituality classes on prayer, &amp;nbsp;and can be used as a prayer guide. It can reach caregivers, patients on hospice, those receiving palliative care, and in bereavement groups. Funeral homes can use this book to comfort families at their times of loss after they make the funeral arrangements. Funeral homes can give this book to them as a way of providing comfort, care and hope as these families grieve. College universities can incorporate this book in palliative care courses. The education systems throughout our country can offer this book as a way to empower others to triumph despite horrific circumstances. It can be a source of encouragement to help others transcend in mind, body, soul and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book relates to a person of all ages because we all have a hurricane sandy in our lives. &amp;nbsp;Some examples include death of a loved one, spouse, child. miscarriages, divorces, loss of good health, job, career, earthquakes, fires, floods. &amp;nbsp;Reading this book Experience God&amp;#39;s Presence will help change lives, inspire others to have a deep relationship with God and to have an experience like no other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
