  <title>Sex, Sin, and Our Selves: Encounters in Feminist Theology and Contemporary Women&#39;s Literature - Anna Fisk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sex, Sin, and Our Selves brings together readings in feminist theological thought and the literature of the acclaimed contemporary writers Michèle Roberts and Sara Maitland. Through placing theology in conversation with Roberts&#39;s and Maitland&#39;s literary engagement with issues of religion and gender, this book explores themes of selfhood, connection, sex, sin, and self-sacrifice. In doing so, it challenges a tendency of feminist theology to seek simple and idealized answers, rather than honor complexity and the need to continue to ask questions. In the encounters in feminist theology and contemporary women&#39;s writing, Anna Fisk employs autobiographical narrative, critically understood as reading these stories beside my own." />
