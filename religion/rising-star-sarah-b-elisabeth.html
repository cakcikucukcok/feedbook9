  <title>Rising Star - Sarah B Elisabeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A journey to &amp;ldquo;Finding home&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the Zen place of peace, freedom, and&amp;nbsp;fulfillment. Written from the life, experiences and wisdom of Sarah B. Elisabeth&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;In her&amp;nbsp;forty years of life on earth, she has come to the realisation that many are plagued by a vague sense of quiet desperation, a fraught awareness of something&amp;nbsp;being missing; adrift in a perpetual and seemingly never-ending search for the ultimate meaning of life. In our generation, this search has taken on the form of the &amp;lsquo;pursuit of happiness&amp;rsquo;, and at its heart is an unshakable need to address the five mutually dependant questions that most trouble the human race. Who am I? Where am I from? Why am I here? What am I capable of achieving? And what is my purpose? To&amp;nbsp;transform every readers&amp;rsquo; field of vision as they learn to confront and embrace life&amp;rsquo;s most important issues. It offers a multidisciplinary approach; a fusion of philosophical, sociological, psychological and the pure science disciplines and theological doctrine that takes you on the journey to &amp;ldquo;finding home.&amp;rdquo; The autobiographical style is interspersed with deep theological doctrine and offset with a broad range of humanitarian viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellness advocate Sarah B Elisabeth uttered the words &amp;ldquo;I want to sleep and never wake up&amp;rdquo; at the tender age of five. This was a startling declaration to her bewildered mother. She sincerely believes that it was at this point her very own search began for that place of peace, freedom, and fulfilment, for which she coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;Finding Home.&amp;rdquo; Sarah B Elisabeth argues that many people are heavily influenced by the drumbeat of popular culture and do not arrive at their worldview from rigorous investigation or indeed any deep sense of conviction. At a time when the standard of truth for so many is relative, seeing the big picture of life is of pivotal importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will help readers discover where their &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; is and chart a course for getting there. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of my own wisdom, life lessons and direction to further resources. One thing is for sure, readers will form firm convictions on life&amp;rsquo;s most important issues, and learn how to master the art of living in a state of enlightened wellness.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;It is a book that anyone could read; a timeless and boundless resource for helping anyone change their life for the better. There isn&amp;#39;t anything else like it on the market.&lt;/p&gt;" />
