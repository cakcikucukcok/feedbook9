  <title>How God Talks When He Isn&#39;t Talking - Rev. Alvin Cordes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reading the content pages of this book will show you that this book is very
practical and may change you forever. However, there are some who should not read
this book. I dare you to overcome the should nots.
Those who should NOT read this book:
Anyone who does not want to have a loving relationship with God.
Anyone who thinks psychiatrists and psychologists are smarter than the Bible
when it comes to human nature.
Any one who believes that God is not interested in his or her problems.
Any one who thinks some things happen by chance, without Gods consent
or control.
Any one who thinks that there is no way to ask God for an immediate decision
to do or not to do, to go or not to go a certain direction.
Any one who thinks the 66 Book Canon has no better information than any
other book.
On the other hand:
If you to want to learn what TICKS GOD OFF;
If you fi nally see that drugs, getting drunk, sex orgies, homolesbianism,
riches can never satisfy your longing for something real;
If you want to try God out, to see if He is really loving; this book will probably
help you. Especially if you have been water baptized, you will fi nally realize that
many times God had his fi nger on your life.
I want to see you in heaven with me." />
