  <title>Mission from the Lord Jesus Christ - Aderonke Morenike Jaiyeoba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lord Jesus appeared to Aderonke, and told her that she has been chosen as a vessel for his kingdom. 24 years later, she came to United State and Lord Jesus visited her again.    Lord Jesus ministered to her and told her to go out there to win soul for Him.  During the course of her studies at CUNY Medgar Evers College, she had another encountered with Our Lord Jesus Christ. Since then, her life change. 1998 when Aderonke wanted to complete her Associate degree in Computer Application Science, something mysterious happened that night she got home. During the night, Aderonke Jaiyeoba saw a ladder that reached in front of her door. Then Angels were ascending and descending from it. The two Angels took her to Heaven. At the gate of Heaven, it was written Welcome to Heaven. One of the Angels came to the gate, brought the Gold Purple Book and gave it to Lord Jesus Christ.
	Lord Jesus Christ appeared to Aderonke and told the Angel to purify her and bring her back. After she returned Lord Jesus told her that there was a mission that both of them have to attend. Aderonke went on a mission with Jesus Christ, where she found herself preaching in the church, performed miracles and touched the life of many people. She is a living testimony to others and her two daughters, Esther and Sarah." />
