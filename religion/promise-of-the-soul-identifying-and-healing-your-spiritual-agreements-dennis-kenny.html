  <title>Promise of the Soul: Identifying and Healing Your Spiritual Agreements - Dennis Kenny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Promise of the Soul is a spiritual workbook. Through simple, accessible exercises and reflections, Kenny offers us practical and proven methods that have enabled thousands of his counseling clients to relinquish their separation from God s love and live from the heart.... Step by step, Kenny s approach shows us how we can release ourselves from self-imposed limitations and lifelong feelings of inadequacy to live a more soul-infused life. It is impossible to read this book without finding yourself somewhere in its pages and setting yourself free. It is a real opportunity.&quot; --From the Foreword by Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D., author of Kitchen Table Wisdom and My Grandfather s Blessings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An excellent resource for creating a new covenant that will enable you to expand your belief system and your life.&quot; --Bernie Siegel, M.D., author of Love, Medicine and Miracles and Prescriptions for Living&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This book, like the topic itself, is beautiful and enchanting. This spiritual light is steeped in the great traditions, yet its presentation is original, creative, and brilliant. An essential key to making peace with God is identifying and healing your spiritual covenant and realizing the promise of your soul.&quot; --Harold Bloomfield, M.D., author of Making Peace with God&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Promise of the Soul is an exceptional guide to examining the spiritual promises or covenants we make with the sacred. Whether we are Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or of any other faith, this book transcends all paths and beliefs to help each of us identify which sacred promises are limiting and which are beneficial to our spiritual unfolding and inherent well-being.&quot; --Angeles Arrien, Ph.D., author of The Four-Fold Way and Signs of Life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;By bringing to light our basic beliefs about how life works, Dennis Kenny gives us room to breathe, to change, to be liberated from prisons of our own making. As a skilled chaplain and teacher, he shows us simple ways to become larger, happier people all that God really wants us to be. This book might just set you free.&quot; --Wayne Muller, author of Sabbath and How, Then, Shall We Live?" />
