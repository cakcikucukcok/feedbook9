  <title>Praying Your Way to Breakthrough - Mercy O. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is God&#39;s perfect will and purpose for us, His children, to walk in a position of authority and dominion on the earth (Gen. 1:27-28). But instead of walking in authority and dominion, many of us walk in defeat and frustration. Many believers have failed to exercise authority over situations that confront them so they can walk in dominion and, therefore, are despaired of life. Many, including some in leadership positions, are not experiencing breakthroughs in their lives. A lot of these believers put on a brave front meanwhile, in their personal lives they are not happy because they are not experiencing victories in a lot of areas in their lives. Some of these people are doing everything they know to do (physically) in order to walk in victory, but no matter how hard they try, they don&#39;t seem to have the results they are looking for." />
