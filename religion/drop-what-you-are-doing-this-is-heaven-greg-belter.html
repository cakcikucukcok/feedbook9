  <title>Drop What You Are Doing This Is Heaven - Greg Belter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our final destiny in life will be to join our creator in heaven after our long journey on earth ends. Before we go to the spirit, into the eternal light, we will learn what heaven is all about from a man who has more out of body experiences than most. With more of an extraordinary ability to receive and share visual information sent down from the heavens, spiritual messaging will come as a very big surprise. The inclusion of special meditations relieves inner tension, opens the spiritual eye within, and is the perfect solution to inner harmony between God and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Foreword
Brighter than the twinkling stars in the  sky, and yet softer than the wool 
on a baby lamb, the light of God will be upon  us in the next life too. 
Abundantly so with goodness, and much to our delight,  we will hardly be 
grasping it entirely, unless one has been immersed into and  has experienced the 
connecting light while fully maximized. The fear of passing  away should no 
longer exist in our mind. Complicated thinking is all that it is.  Just as 
simple as knowing there is love in the afterlife, that is where our  heart and 
soul belongs. Travel to heaven in the highway of your mind. It is very  
safe lifting a yielding conscious to achieve exceptional knowledge within the  
spirit world." />
