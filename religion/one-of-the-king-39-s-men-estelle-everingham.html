  <title>One of the King&#39;s Men - Estelle Everingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the King&#39;s Men is the completely factual account of the remarkable life of my son Cameron, whose short Earthly journey demonstrated his unique connection with the miraculous, heavenly realm in which he could function with complete ease and gladness.
Cameron was a tall, blond athlete; a kind, loving, and helpful boy; obedient and well-mannered always; a consistent trier; neat and tidy; and a joy to his whole family. Right from his babyhood, he began to demonstrate his exceptional capacity for the supernatural realm of the Spirit and his unquenchable desire to connect with heaven and with God. 
Cameron was, in many ways, a typical, laid-back Aussie kid growing up in the 1980s and into the 1990s. He loved and enjoyed very much the company of his sister and brother, and his life included many of the usual adventures and misadventures common to typical young Aussie boys. 
His story is told with authenticity, comical whimsy, enthusiasm, gladness, and a sense of pride in his achievements, evenly mixed with trepidation, horror, and life-changing sorrow, followed by generous helpings of amazement, shock and awe, and finally, real, genuine thankfulness. 
This is Cameron&#39;s story and welcome to it.
NB. A very few names have been changed to pacify reluctant stars." />
