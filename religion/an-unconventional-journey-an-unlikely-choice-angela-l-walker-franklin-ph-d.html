  <title>An Unconventional Journey….. an Unlikely Choice - Angela L. Walker Franklin Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story of perseverance and awakening.&lt;br&gt;
As a child, Angela Walker Franklin faced clear expectations for &lt;br&gt;
success from very supportive and engaged parents, yet self-doubt and trepidation continued to raise its ugly head along the way. She was steadfast and determined in her journey, which took several twists and turns until she let go and let God order her steps. &lt;br&gt;
This journey evolved into a purpose-driven life that led her to a &lt;br&gt;
college presidency in a most unlikely place. The lessons learned along the way have defined her current approach to leadership &lt;br&gt;
and should be inspirational to others who are trying to &lt;br&gt;
chart their own path.&lt;/p&gt;" />
