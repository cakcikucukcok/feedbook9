  <title>The Intuitive Wisdom of the Heart - James P. Robson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book is my eighth containing poems about life and the human heart. The heart is misunderstood by many and yet is an intuitive and wisdom-based organ which functions as the chief administrator of mankind. Over many years, I have discovered that our primary purpose in life is to discover who we really are. We need to identify with ourselves and embark on a journey non self-discovery. As the question of who we are lingers and our curiosity continues to confront us, our need to answer this question intensifies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopefully, many of my words will provide insight into both the heart and the mind and how they function in concert to fulfill God&amp;rsquo;s will. The ideas inscribed in my many poems represent my determination and desire to connect with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ where I can find both rest and the knowledge of who I am. I believe that practice makes perfect and with patience and determination our search will lead to the treasure that confirms who we are and enables us to understand our Christian identity. With much encouragement,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James P. Robson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
