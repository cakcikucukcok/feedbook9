  <title>Can&#39;t Nothing Bring Me Down - Ida Keeling, Anita Diggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As seen on&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The View&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Nothing Bring Me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Down&lt;/em&gt; is the memoir of 104-year-old, world-record-holding runner Ida Keeling. Miss Ida, as she&amp;rsquo;s known throughout her Bronx community, isn&amp;rsquo;t your typical runner. Her fierce independence helped her through the Depression and the Civil Rights movement. But her greatest trials were yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ida&amp;rsquo;s two sons were brutally murdered. Justice was never found. Ida felt like she didn&amp;rsquo;t have the strength to carry on and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t hope anymore. But encouraged by her daughter, Ida put on her first pair of running shoes at the age of sixty-seven and began to chase the paralyzing sorrow from her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running gave light and new energy to Ida, and since her first race nearly thirty-five years ago, she&amp;rsquo;s kept running and never looked back. Holding the world record for the fastest time in the 60-meter dash for the 95-99 age group, Ida isn&amp;rsquo;t slowing down. Now she gives us a clear picture of what it means to overcome obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ida Keeling shares her inspirational story about growing up as a child of immigrants during the Depression and later raising four children as a single mother. She offers time-tested truths gathered from a lifetime of watching a nation change and from a life-long faith in Jesus. &amp;ldquo;Every night, I thank him for my many blessings, for his guidance, for his protection,&amp;rdquo; Ida says, &amp;ldquo;And every night he tells me, &#39;Miss Ida, you just keep on, because I ain&#39;t done with you yet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
