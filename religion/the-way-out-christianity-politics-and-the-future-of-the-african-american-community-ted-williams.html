  <title>The Way Out: Christianity, Politics, and the Future of the African-American Community - Ted Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The African-American community represents a paradox of sorts. While collective success has been achieved in many areas, African-Americans still disproportionately suffer from a variety of social ills. The residual effects from years of slavery and exclusion from the major institutions of American life are still trenchant. Yet, there is hope. As we move forward into a new millennium, our greatest answers can be found by exploring the past. The Christian faith has served as a sustaining force that has been the backbone of this community for generations. This faith, along with a holistic commitment to family, political participation, education, and entrepreneurship, are the key to its future.  The Way Out tackles this issue with a mature voice that represents a juxtaposition of faith and public policy. It rejects the culture of partisan gridlock, racial division, and religious cynicism by fostering a fresh and pluralistic discourse about the greatest solutions for our most pressing civic challenges. From the experienced policymaker to the common citizen wanting to make a difference, The Way Out provides tangible solutions through which we can all find ways to engage. It stands firmly at the intersection of religion, race, politics, and culture to light a clear path forward." />
