  <title>MIDNIGHT CONNECTIONS - Mohsen N Harandi, Amanda Midkiff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My first goal for this book is to provide a simplified English view of the deep Persian philosophies reflected in the masterpieces of Hafez, Saadi, Rumi and Khayyam poems.&amp;nbsp; Over centuries thanks to amazing devotion of many poetic heroes, the poem lovers around the world have been introduced to these teachings through translation.&amp;nbsp; I am hoping these master&amp;#39;s teachings engrained in me since childhood would enable me to provide a different reflection of these teachings through my original English poems.&amp;nbsp; In this materialistic world, their teachings can help us focus on the beauties in life to enjoy the privilege of living on earth while pointing out the smallness of the day to day stresses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another goal of this book is to share what I learned in bursts of awareness about how life came about, the challenges we overcome to reach happiness, the role and majesty of nature, and our hidden yet obvious connections to the spiritual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last goal is to share some of my life experiences and learning on how love, poems, nature and optimism can make living brighter.&amp;nbsp; Throughout these months the poems taught me some amazing concepts that I had not learned in the last 59 years.&amp;nbsp; An interesting learning was that the poems written in the middle of night did not need essentially any correction and even somehow my Persian accent was not present in the rhythms!&amp;nbsp; This is another proof for me that our subconscious has amazing powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
