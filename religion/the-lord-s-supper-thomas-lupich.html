  <title>The Lord’S Supper - Thomas Lupich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Thomas Lupich is the Preceptor of the International Society of Seekers of the Truth, a retired electrical designer from Princeton Universitys Plasma
    Physics Laboratory, and a &lt;em&gt;taiji &lt;/em&gt;instructor with an interest in science and health. His major interest is Biblical Truth. He, therefore, considers
    himself a Truth Seeker: an avocation that he recommends to all men. Jesus commanded his disciples to become Seekers of the Truth and Thomas Lupich took Him
    at His Word. Solomon had this to say, &lt;em&gt;It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Thomas has written The Lords Supper Mingle With the Best to expound on the meaning and the blessings of the Eucharist. The Lords Supper has various
    important layers of meaning, but much more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;it tells us how we can be transmuted into beings much like Him. &lt;/strong&gt;The hope of the
    author is to share with his readers the Eucharists Light and its ability to transmute lives in the following way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Those that truly partake of the Lords Supper will be &lt;strong&gt;mingling with the Best, i.e., The Father and The Son. &lt;/strong&gt;The mingling will cause
    much of the Best to rub off on &lt;em&gt;them. &lt;/em&gt;What rubs off will make &lt;em&gt;them &lt;/em&gt;grow and glow, not only in this present age, but also in the eons to
    come!
