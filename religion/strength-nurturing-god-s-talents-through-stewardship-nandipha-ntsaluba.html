  <title>Strength Nurturing God’S Talents Through Stewardship - Nandipha Ntsaluba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parable articulated in Matthew 25, profiles the need to dig up the buried talents and maximise these, as a faithful steward. The book encapsulates the authors inner drive to pen events and thoughts that occupied her space. Focusing on Nandis dimple, which is Gods given trademark that must be protected and treasured, the book illuminates the authors thought processes. 
Well known to be a slow actor and mistakenly referred to as indecisive, she spends moments extracting the best out of every situation. Over years, she learnt the ability to transcend situations and rise to the best occasion. 
These thoughts have been packaged to unveil her physical, social and spiritual life, portraying her origins and how her upbringing has affected her professional and spiritual being. 
The views herein present the author as an individual, driven by her analytical skills, capturing Nandi the child, spiritual being, parent, the mentor and the mentored. The author belongs to a great clan of thinkers and cultural beings. She acknowledges military members who identified the talent and continually instructed her to put pen to paper. 
Finally, the ground breaking publication has revived the sleeping giant within the author and all that is there to say is that the pen is going to claim its power, more than ever!" />
