  <title>A Place of Refuge - Tom Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The vision struck like a bolt of lighting. Tom Thompson had to pull off the highway to avoid an accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vision: an isolated rural farm where addicts could come and escape their lives, break free of addiction, and walk with God. They would learn to be sober and live out the scriptures in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a vision from God&amp;mdash;but merely a vision. Tom made it his life&amp;rsquo;s work to make the vision a reality. In 1999, he founded the Refuge Ministries to help addicts get clean and sober by identifying and addressing the spiritual brokenness that underlies their addiction. The ministry applies a faith-based approach to treating addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it worked. To date, the Refuge has helped well over 2,500 men shuck off the shackles of addiction and transform into better citizens, sons, husbands, and fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Refuge has grown thanks to the service of others. Founder and Executive Director Tom Thompson is now growing the ministry beyond its own confines by helping other leaders of service establish similar ministries and organizations. The Refuge is the prototype for a new &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo; model for treating addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PLACE OF REFUGE is more than just a blueprint for a new addiction treatment model. It is also a treatise for finding your own &amp;ldquo;calling&amp;rdquo; and serving God and your fellow man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
