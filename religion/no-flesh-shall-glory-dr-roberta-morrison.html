      <meta name="description" content="God does not want us to worship idols but to worship Him. We need to acknowledge the power, presence and authority of God who is at work in our lives. We are a triune being: body, soul and spirit. As God uses us as instruments to the Body of Christ we cant make the mistake and believe that these gifts are ours and others should give us the glory. We have been created by God to worship Him and when we dont we will worship something else. Isaiah 42:8 states I am the Lord; that is My name! And my glory I will not give another, nor My praise to graven images. We need to lift up Jesus. When we lift Jesus up and seek His face then the glory comes. His glory will not come when we are lifting up idols or lifting up a man. We need to return to the basics and the simplicity of the gospel and lift up Jesus. The banner needs to be Jesus. When we deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow Him then His glory shines through us and others are led to Him." />
