  <title>Seriously God? - Jenny Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our house was going into foreclosure, we were moving into a rental house, and God didnt seem to care. We had thought he would come through. He didnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennys family faced foreclosure, job loss, the anxiety of no health insurance, and having to learn adapt to a different income bracket, like so many other families. &lt;em&gt;Seriously, God?&lt;/em&gt; is not just a book title but the question our hearts are struggling with in these uncertain times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Jenny as she shares her journey of discovering who Jesus said he is and the impact this knowledge had on the early church. Believers like us, who were on a roller coaster that jerked them around and pushed them to dizzying heights, only to plunge them to the depths, over and over that&#39;s what this journey is about, a depth of relationship with God that, even as we stand smack-dab in the middle of life, we have a faith that stays steady and strong!&lt;/p&gt;" />
