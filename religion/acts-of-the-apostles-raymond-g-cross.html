  <title>Acts of the Apostles - Raymond G. Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an adjunct to the book of Luke. It readily portrays the continuing work of the Apostles and all Christians who are ambassadors of/for the Lord Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extraordinarily noteworthy how well Jesus&amp;rsquo; name is known in our world today. He is the very Son of God and yet, He is almost totally neglected by humankind. Mankind is losing out on some very important intelligence and knowledge. Individuals are losing even more, because it is only through Jesus, one may have eternal life in heaven. Biblical prophetic signs indicate that we are near the very end of time and still, humankind pays no heed. In the Bible are irrefutable facts to show the truths of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Luke knew the truth! That Jesus had come to earth, as a human-being to redeem mankind. God decreed that Jesus would become the sacrifice that He required, to totally cleanse man of sin. Because much information was not written down or written on notes here and there, Dr. Luke decided to gather all the information into one place &amp;ndash; a book. His record of the activities and miracles the disciples and apostles did, attest to his carefully kept accounts of the very early church. This book is Dr. Luke&amp;rsquo;s presentation of his witness and experience, as a proselyte, who gathered all the information he could, into one place, for people to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to me how people do not want to know or understand the truth! The Bible is the most wonderful book ever written. Written by about forty-five men, directed by God, over a period of 4000 years. It is correct factually, historically, archeologically and proven many times to be so. Mankind disregards his history and his future by not paying attention to the accounts given in the Old and New Testaments. Included in mankind&amp;rsquo;s disregard of his background and forthcoming, he completely misses out on knowing God. God &amp;ndash; man&amp;rsquo;s creator and sustainer is an unknown to most people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
