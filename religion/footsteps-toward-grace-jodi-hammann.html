      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Life may throw us many curves, and sometimes it feels as if we missed one and ended up over the edge. Thank goodness that we have a big God who picks us up dusts us off and helps us to see that we did not miss it after all; we just misjudged it a little and only swerved. I often wonder if I am the only one that ever feels that way. Sometimes it seems that we are the only ones with a particular problem and are ashamed of the life we have been dealt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through all of the hardships, abuse, depression, and bullyingthrough losing my father and almost losing everything I had come to know and loveI found the Lord. It is through his grace that I am now free from all the bondage I was held in for so many years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can choose to be lost, or choose to be found. I choose to be found. I have a peace about me and, for the first time in my life, am truly happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book is a collection of stories from my life. You will read about the ups, the downs, the tears, and the laughter. You will learn how I went for thirty-nine years of my life without the Lord and see how these stories are my &lt;em&gt;Footsteps toward Grace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
