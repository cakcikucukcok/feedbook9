  <title>The Transfigured Kingdom - Ernest A. Zitser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In this richly comparative analysis of late Muscovite and early Imperial court culture, Ernest A. Zitser provides a corrective to the secular bias of the scholarly literature about the reforms of Peter the Great. Zitser demonstrates that the tsar&#39;s supposedly &quot;secularizing&quot; reforms rested on a fundamentally religious conception of his personal political mission. In particular, Zitser shows that the carnivalesque (and often obscene) activities of the so-called Most Comical All-Drunken Council served as a type of Baroque political sacrament—a monarchical rite of power that elevated the tsar&#39;s person above normal men, guaranteed his prerogative over church affairs, and bound the participants into a community of believers in his God-given authority (&quot;charisma&quot;). The author suggests that by implicating Peter&#39;s &quot;royal priesthood&quot; in taboo-breaking, libertine ceremonies, the organizers of such &quot;sacred parodies&quot; inducted select members of the Russian political elite into a new system of distinctions between nobility and baseness, sacrality and profanity, tradition and modernity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tracing the ways in which the tsar and his courtiers appropriated aspects of Muscovite and European traditions to suit their needs and aspirations, &lt;I&gt;The Transfigured Kingdom&lt;/I&gt; offers one of the first discussions of the gendered nature of political power at the court of Russia&#39;s self-proclaimed &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; and reveals the role of symbolism, myth, and ritual in shaping political order in early modern Europe.&lt;/P&gt;" />
