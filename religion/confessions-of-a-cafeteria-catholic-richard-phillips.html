  <title>Confessions of a Cafeteria Catholic - Richard Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The thoughts contained here have more to do with me and my own perspective of life than the perspective of any one established religious institution, Catholic or otherwise. That is perhaps the goal of all men and women who strive to find themselves and their God while facing the joys and challenges of life, trying to find the faith that keeps them on the path of discovering who they are and what they believe. If we are true to our faith, whatever that faith is, the most important thing is to listen to God, to His revealed message for us personally. God speaks to each of us personally, uniquely, speaking to our own needs. These essays are intended to help open your mind to the possibility of asking questions, not about the veracity of the revealed Word of the Scriptures, but about how we see our relationship with God and how we find our way home. I hope you will find this a useful tool in your own attempt at finding your path.&lt;/p&gt;
