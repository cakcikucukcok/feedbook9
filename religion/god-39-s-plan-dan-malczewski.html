  <title>God&#39;s Plan - Dan Malczewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A compilation of Christian Apologetics gathered from various authors over the years that is designed to bring brand new Christians up-to-speed quickly and to stengthen the faith for all Christians. This book also introduces a model of Gods Plan for mankind. It contains answers to almost all of the arguments leveled against Christianity from science falsely so-called. Furthermore, this book provides an historical discussion of Christian prophecy from a Dispensational persepective.
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that genetic anthrop-olgists have traced back our DNA to single parents; or that most of the miracles of the Old Testament probably occurred naturally such as the parting of the Red Sea; or that approximately 1,600 Bible Codes have been discovered around a single Old Testament chapter; or that it is highly probable that no human beings drowned in the Flood; or that Mount Sinai is not in the Sinai Peninsula but in Saudi Arabia and is heavily guarded; or that the speed of light may have been millions of times faster at the Creation than it is now? All of these questions, and many more, are answered in this book." />
