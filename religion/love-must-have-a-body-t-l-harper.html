  <title>Love Must Have a Body - T. L. Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book you will want to revisit time and time again. Why? Each time you read and meditate on what this work reveals about the subject, its revelations will pull you into new statures of faith. You will discover new thresholds of awareness and assurance of Gods Love, what Love is, and how that same Love is reflected in daily life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Feedback from Readers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear friend, you have succeeded in writing a fabulous Book. If someone would have offered me this book 30 years ago, I would have been far beyond where I am now in my communication with God.   Love it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br Archbishop Corlis Dees, II&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Im amazed at the timeless thoughtfulness each moment placed into words youve used to share this with others. Thats beauty of the talent you possess. It was the renewing of that story point that takes me &amp; others to deeper relationships &amp; experiences with God.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Mark San Agustin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading the manuscript. I could not stop reading it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Nafeseh Ph,D&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Amazing and impactful Read! Filled with provocative truths. I found myself drawn to deeper spiritual meditation with each reading.&lt;br&gt;
