  <title>The Berean and the Goldfish - Stephen James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of ideas for the people who seek to know and enjoy more of Gods Word. As referenced in the Book of Acts Chapter 17, Verse 11: These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
This enormous compliment and honor is paid to the Bereans  and I use this reference to associate with all those people who place the Word of God above tradition, above rumor, above fiction, above social acceptance, above entertainment, above religious propaganda, above political correctness, and above cultural differences. 
2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, 
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, 
rightly dividing the Word of truth. 
Jeremiah 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, 
when ye shall search for me with all your heart. 
2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, 
shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn 
from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and 
will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." />
