      <meta name="description" content="If you have ever wondered what made David a man after Gods own heart, the secret is in these pages. Davids entire life is characterized by his understanding of prayer. We need look no farther than Psalms to see that prayer was his native tongue. Each psalm is an illustration of Davids vulnerability versus Gods strength, and Gods strength wins every time. This book teaches you the art of prayer, taking your vulnerability and pairing it with Gods strength. In these pages, you will develop a prayer life like you have never had and you will find your heart changed by it. You will learn a pattern of prayer that can stick with you long after you have finished this study." />
