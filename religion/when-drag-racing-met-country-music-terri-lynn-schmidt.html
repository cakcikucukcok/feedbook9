  <title>When Drag Racing Met Country Music - Terri Lynn Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In search of a new identity outside of marriage after the death of her husband, Terri Lynn’s collection of writings addresses all matters of the heart. Her message of Faith, Hope, and Love is supported by scriptures.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the author: &quot;Till death do you part.” Words I hung upon and waited for during the first wedding ceremony I attended after my husband died. Instantly our 3-chord unity, that had been tethered together for over 20 years, severed. Was I a free woman? Free to do what? Most certainly a heartbroken woman. After all I did not choose the tearing of hearts and certainly it was not what I had planned on happening at such a young age. No one to check in with upon returning home or to meet for dinner or a movie. Silence. Alas, there was One. My Heavenly Father became my best friend and my Husband. Rediscovering my love for writing, along with scripture, the collections inside helped in finding my way back to where my true identity lies. The wife of a Drag Racing Legend was who I had become; identity in Christ is where I am now. Whether you are a widow or searching for more meaning relating to heart issues, welcome. Let us sojourn together." />
