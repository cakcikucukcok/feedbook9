  <title>Holy Thirst - Editors at Paraclete Press, Adam Bucko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These saints have spoken to the hearts of millions. They’ve helped many on the way to understanding the role of God in their lives. In this collection, may their words again help all who long for a life of meaning, touched and transfigured by God.
Holy Thirst presents all the essential themes of Carmelite spirituality, excerpted from classics such as The Way of Perfection of St. Teresa of Avila, The Ascent of Mount Carmel by St. John of the Cross, The Story of a Soul of St. Therese of Lisieux, and The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence. Also included are shorter portions by lesser known, more recent Carmelites: St. Elizabeth of the Trinity, St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein), and Sr. Miriam of the Holy Spirit (Jessica Powers).
“As you hold this collection, it is important to recall the beginnings of Carmelite spirituality, a beginning that takes us back to the twelfth century and the time of the Crusades. A band of brothers–conscientious objectors, of sorts–witnessed firsthand the clash of civilizations and all that it entailed. They knew death, they knew loss, and their very souls were bruised. The only next step that they could envision was to leave the world as they knew it and settle on the sacred mountain known for centuries to Jews, Christians and Muslims as the holy home of the Prophet Elijah...” –Adam Bucko, from the Foreword" />
