But how do we learn to see the beauty in ourselves the way God does, and what does it mean to honor the women we love? &lt;i&gt;My Queen: The Beauty in You&lt;/i&gt; uses the stories of women in the Bible to illuminate the lives of todays women in fresh new ways. It also shows us that those who cultivate a culture of valuing women help create peace in their homes, their communities, and the world as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Queen&lt;/i&gt; speaks to every woman, young or old, married or single, widowed or divorced. Even those who have been abused or abandoned will learn that God often uses the worst circumstances to bring out a womans best qualities, empowering her to define herself rather than letting events define her. No matter where you are in your life, your uniqueness as a woman deserves to be celebrated!&lt;/p&gt;

Men will gain insight into the female psyche and learn what listening to and incorporating womens wisdom can contribute to their own lives. Author Chienyem U. Uchime Opara even uses intriguing plant metaphors to help womenand those who love themunderstand and nurture themselves. Poems, along with space to add your own photos and notes, can further aid you on your journey. Discover the woman God intended you to be; learn how to honor the women you love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
