In it you will find highlights, short stories, and personal proving testimonies of the Author.  God has given each of us certain realms of authority and grace, and we need to be careful not to go beyond these appointed realms  Joel 2:7-8.  Traps are set by the enemy of Christ to make His Church to act against the divine Word of Godhead with His Principle and pattern in other to watered down the divine presence of God Almighty in the midst of His people, to delay the coming of Christ, to hinder the church benefits and blessing and most intently, to nullify individual from making heaven.  The Godhead has not kept mute in setting guideposts, warning and directions for escape for whoever cares to listen and obey.  The road might not be too easy, but divine Godhead is your Anchor you can hold onto Him; try to obey Him and live for Him 2Timothy 2:5, 4:8, 1Corinthian 9:25.&lt;/p&gt;
