  <title>Promises of Hope - C. Denise Knox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Matthew was thrown in jail on July 21, 2001, I had mountains of feelings. I knew his life was coming to a boiling point. With drugs, alcohol, stealing and living the wild life he had chosen to live, it couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t last long. Not with the promise God had given me for his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
This was a promise I was soon going to question. I would even question the very existence of a loving, kind God whom I had believed in all my life, and had raised my children to believe in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Soon, way too soon, my faith would be put to the ultimate test. Do I truly believe? Is He really a God of love and mercy? How could He be so cruel to those He&#39;s supposed to love so much? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Today, I know the answer to these questions, without any doubt. This is my journey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
