  <title>From Fear to Faith - Christopher Rory Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHRISTOPHER RORY PAGE
Two bodies, two souls and an inspiring four way conversation between contrasting mortals as they journey through the African bush and discover the way from Fear to faith.
The author awakens one morning riddled with fear from a deafening noise outside his bungalow window. This is the beginning of an exploration into the self as he meets a primitive man who proves that there is more to someone than meets the eye. A non-verbal form of communication develops between as the two men dissect the concept of fear based on age-old theories and beliefs.
The reader is introduced to the Ukuesaba Isitebhisa which translated from Zulu means Fear Ladder. This shows the progression of fear from the most superficial to the most concrete. The common denominator to minimise the fear on all levels is to instil faith in various forms.
From Fear to faith is an inspiring story and teaches as much as it entertains. Light hearted moments dispersed with simple truths make it must read for anyone who aims to minimise the fears in their lives which prevent them from being who they were born to be." />
