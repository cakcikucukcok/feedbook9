  <title>Walking on Water with St. Peter: Reflections to Strengthen Your Faith - Guiseppe Agostino, Marsha Daigle-Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He was called Simon. He was Jonah&#39;s son and Andrew&#39;s brother. Both brothers had met Jesus, heard his call, and followed him, leaving everything and everyone else behind. We know the rest of the story-a story that has captured the hearts of followers of Jesus for more than two thousand years. These series of brief meditations focus on scenes from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in which St. Peter appears, speaks, or acts, as well as passages from Peter&#39;s New Testament letters. Archbishop Emeritus Giuseppe Agostino presents the biblical passage and then a short meditation that speaks to us today about our own lives of faith. With spontaneity, enthusiasm, and a passionate but sometimes wavering faith, St. Peter jumped out of the boat and walked on water. These reflections can help our own faith grow so that we, too, can get out of the boat with our eyes focused only on our Lord." />
