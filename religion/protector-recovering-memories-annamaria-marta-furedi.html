      <meta name="description" content="Annamaria used to be a normal girl until a recurring dream almost drove her insane. Every night, she dreamed about her lost brother. One day she decided to seek help with a psychotherapist through a regressive hypnosis session. 
Her life changed forever. During the session, not only did Anna found out she actually had a brother, but with the door of her subconscious mind being left open by the therapist, she just kept finding out more and more about her past lives.
Having this gift and curse at the same time almost killed her until she decided to put them on paper. That’s when her health and her life changed for the better. Writing actually started to give her life a meaning, she was determined to show her discoveries to the world.
“From a burden, they became my treasure. Suddenly, I had much more life experience, and by curing the revealed old wounds I started to feel better” - she says. She attempts to analyze the phenomena of reincarnation, presenting two episodes that she could recall." />
