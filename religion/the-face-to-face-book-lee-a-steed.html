  <title>The Face to Face Book - Lee A. Steed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I began to write. My purpose was to share Jesus the best way I knew how: on social media. I wrote with those going through the same things in mind. I wrote hoping someone would want to get closer to Jesus. I wrote with faces and names on my mind. I wrote with a broken heart, a joyful heart, a saddened heart. I wrote, and a few of you read them. I still write with the same intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago, my husband began collecting my writings and put them in a binder as Christmas presents for my girls. I dont know if they have ever read them, but someday, when they need it most, they will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book you hold consists of some of those writings, thoughts, and opinions. I hope you understand it isnt a normal compilation: no chapters, no themes, just some writings that have happened through good and bad. These moments were captured during some of the most trying times of life. I have a lot of them it seemsjust like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe your life is organized, planned, and perfect. If so, definitely put this book down. If you are struggling, then maybe something within this book will help you. Maybe you will find yourself face to face with the one who loves you most. He promised He would be there.&lt;/p&gt;" />
