  <title>Power, Politics, and Change - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers examines how to maintain your benevolent motivations without falling prey to the controlling tendencies inherent in those seeking to lead others. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power, Politics, and Change: What Can I Do to Help Make the World a Better Place?&lt;/i&gt; takes on the conventional wisdom that &quot;power corrupts&quot; and proposes instead that those who seek power are already corrupt: Once they attain their goal, their corruption simply has the opportunity to express itself. That&#39;s why even those who seek power in order to bring about radical change so often fail, despite their best intentions. Osho looks at where this &quot;will to power&quot; comes from, how it expresses itself not only in political institutions, but in our everyday relationships. In the process, he offers a vision of relationships and society based not on power over others, but on a recognition of the uniqueness of every individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring an original talk by Osho on DVD, you&#39;ll experience his philosophies and values straight from the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
