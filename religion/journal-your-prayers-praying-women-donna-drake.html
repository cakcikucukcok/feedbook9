  <title>Journal Your Prayers Praying Women - Donna Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I want to encourage you to pray the will of God, journal your prayers, and experience a new relationship with Jesus, where you desire to be in His presence continually. Record the date of your prayer, the time, and how He answered those prayers. You will be astounded to discover how God has responded to your prayers. God is an awesome God and He hastens to perform His Word! Give Him all the Glory! Yes! Miracles still happen today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Donna DD Drake, author of&lt;em&gt;Prayers of Gods Powerful Women&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first met Donna Drake forty years ago while attending a prayer class she taught at our church. She stressed the importance of having an intimate prayer life and encouraged us to keep a journal in order to later reflect on our prayers. She was approachable and willing to answer my questions, thus forming a relationship founded in prayer. We have seen answers to prayer that only God could have answered. I am so grateful to God for our friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Violet West, music minister&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna Drake has been Gods precious gift for me. Her mentoring and her teachings, especially on prayer, have broadened my understanding of the power of prayer, the miracles that follow, and the absolute necessity of a close and humble relationship with God. Prayer truly changes the world. God is waiting to hear from each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Francie Officer, educator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never met a stronger prayer warrior and woman of faith than Donna Drake. You can believe that if she speaks it, she lives it! I am honored to have had this godly woman pray for me all of my life. Through her example I have also been taught how to pray for others. I am very proud to call her Mom. I love you!&lt;/p&gt;
