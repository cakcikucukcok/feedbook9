  <title>Ambushed: an Uplifting Story by a Determined Man - Dr. Paul L. Freeman Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can I have hope in what appears to be a hopeless situation? Is the question confronting a vast number of Christians today. As Christians, we know all of the right words to say when an unexpected storm enters our life, but living what we profess becomes a challenge when it appears that God is not hearing our prayers. I have learned that it is easy to trust God when life is going well. However, can we trust Him when we find ourselves in the midst of a storm and Jesus appears to be sleeping?  As such, the ultimate purpose of this book is to encourage others that they must never allow their situation to cause them to give up on God, because God doesnt give up on us. Therefore, it is because of the life of Christ and this situation that I have transitioned from asking Why me? to Why not me?&lt;/p&gt;" />
