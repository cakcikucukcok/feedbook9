  <title>Storied Revelations: Parables, Imagination, and George MacDonald&#39;s Christian Fiction - Gisela H. Kreglinger, Eugene H. Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parables--used by Jesus to reveal to us the kingdom of God, used to move us from being bystanders to active recipients of God&#39;s work of revelation--are constantly at risk of being buried as mummies of prose, as George MacDonald puts it. We become so familiar with the language of Scripture that Jesus&#39; parables no longer work on us in this revelatory and transforming way.   George MacDonald, the Victorian poet and theologian, observed this very process at work in Victorian society. It was a culture saturated with Christian jargon but often devoid of a profound understanding of the gospel for its own time and culture. The language of Scripture no longer penetrated people&#39;s hearts, imaginations, and attitudes; it no longer transformed people&#39;s lives. MacDonald, called to be a pastor, turned to story and more specifically the parabolic as a means of spiritual awakening. He created fictive worlds in which the language of Jesus would find a new home and regain its revelatory power for his particular Victorian audience." />
