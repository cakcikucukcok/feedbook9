  <title>The Journey Called Ministry - Dorcas Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The journey to any form of ministry is the most exciting journey you will ever take.  There is no roller coaster that can compete. The only way to feel the excitement is to take the journey.  This journey brightens a life like nothing else can.  As you read this book your emotions will be stimulated with such statements as:
Are you trying to put your name on that mountain of success, or erect a flag that gives honor to God!
Words that are contrary to our actions make us two-faced!
The best way for our buying audience to have confidence in the gospel we present, is for us to display it in our own lives.  Show the world what you&#39;re working with!
-----------------------------------------
In the pages of this book, you will receive practical help in your journey; renewal of your faith that whatever God has called you to do, He will qualify you. There will be obstacles along the way, but success is assured, --not based on man&#39;s opinion -- but based on your submission to the will of God. 
In spite of the obstacles along the way, as long as you submit to God&#39;s will, there is no failure in Him. 
As you make THE JOURNEY CALLED MINISTRY, be reminded , there is humor in even the smallest task God  calls you to do!
Enjoy the journey and the blessings that follow the chosen of God!" />
