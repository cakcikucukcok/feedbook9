  <title>Killed by the Church, Resurrected by Christ - Rick Apperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It seems today that people no longer want to actively participate in church. Ask most of those who have abandoned the church and you will hear stories of hypocrisy and church abuse. Long-time believers are ready to walk away out of boredom and frustration. Killed by the Church, Resurrected by Christ seeks to equip people with the principles they need in order to fall in love with the church again in a much healthier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will find stories from around the world and right next door. Stories of all the good the church has to offer and sadly, some of the worst as well. You will discover Biblical principles that relate not only to church, but to our relationship with the body of Christ at large. You will hopefully develop a deeper understanding of your identity in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also read of the authors recovery from death by church and his own resurrection by Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick takes the reader through a valley of the shadow of deathonly, sadly, this valleys shadow is cast by a series of disastrous church experiences. But through it, he freshly encounters Christ, and learns that surely goodness and mercy follow him all the days of his life, and he will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. This is a book for all those who love the church enough to want the best for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom,&lt;/p&gt;
