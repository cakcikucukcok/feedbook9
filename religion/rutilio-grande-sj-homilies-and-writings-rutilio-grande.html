  <title>Rutilio Grande, SJ: Homilies and Writings - Rutilio Grande</title>

He was killed on March 12, 1977, for having done the works that Jesus commands with regard to one&amp;#39;s neighbor as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church. This volume of his writings and homilies illustrates how he applied the social and ecclesial teachings of the Second Vatican Council (1962&amp;ndash;1965) in his ministry with the poor and marginalized of El Salvador. His use of the social sciences to understand the problems in his context, his prophetic denunciation of power and wealth, and his ministry to empower laypeople to lead their faith communities all speak to the Holy Spirit working through the courage of a true servant leader.&lt;/div&gt;" />
