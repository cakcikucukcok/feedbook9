  <title>Scribe&#39;s Treasure - Rev Marion H Gwynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As both chemist and priest your scribe believes that the current gap between science and religion can be bridged largely by revelation.  Revelation is a select part of religion, often beyond the ken or competence of qualified science.  Types of revelation comprise the manifest supernatural and prophecy, fulfilled prophecy supporting what is yet to be fulfilled.  The book offers answers and asks a variety of questions. 
This book is written in four sections, each with chapter-like and numbered subsections:
 Section 1 the most scriptural and salvational 
  Section 2 the most prophetic or revelatory
  Section 3 the most scientific and integrative knowledge
  Section 4 the most semantic and hypothetic
 Section 1
Scripture, Old and New Testament, appears to be a rich source of revelation and other reliable spiritual reality.  Its integrity distinguishes divine and human reporting, also religion versus irreligion.  Jesus&#39; early advent fulfilled dozens of Old Testament prophecies; divine evidence for the reliability of its revelation.  Scripture reveals that Jesus of Nazareth walked among us, both man and God.
 Section 2
Section 2 comprise a commentary upon the Revelation to John.  The prophecy concentrated therein is mysterious in part yet relatively ordered and culminating.  It helps to organize other prophecy revealed in Scripture.  And it serves to guide our on-going participation with the ascended Christ as Lord.  Prophecy reveals that God has operated mightily in and on history, that he has revealed essential parts of his plan and care for mankind.
 Section 3
Without religion, science, particularly inanimate science, tends to support determinism, also a relatively rigid causation or rationalism.  Science develops knowledge more than understanding.  Section 3 attempts to assemble salient science together with a minor proportion of related hypotheses.  Your scribe believes that God&#39;s concern and involvement and control of life is more intimate and profound than most science and philosophy has indicated.
 Section 4
The relatively hypothetic Section 4 comprises much supposition, some semantically treated.  Suppositions are offered concerning material or systematic structures for said living sub matter in body, mind and soul.
 Life after first death is a gift from the soul&#39;s Creator.  Spirits just and unjust await resurrection in the spirit, not in the flesh, not in reincarnation.  Tthe soul is foundational to theology and tends to respond to spiritual reality, to living sub matter, particularly to God and other souls." />
