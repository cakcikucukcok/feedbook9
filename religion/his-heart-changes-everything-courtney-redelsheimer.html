  <title>His Heart Changes Everything - Courtney Redelsheimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Where do we turn when all we know and understand is stolen from our lives? Some&amp;nbsp;have turned to family, friends, or jobs as&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;source of healing&amp;nbsp;after tragedy. Others prefer&amp;nbsp;alcohol, drugs or other abusive behaviors that promise to&amp;nbsp;hide&amp;nbsp;the pain in our traumatized lives. Following these paths, we&amp;nbsp;enter into lives&amp;nbsp;of denial. Insisting that all is ok,&amp;nbsp;we push ourselves to keep&amp;nbsp;moving forward.&amp;nbsp; In His mercy, these paths will prove fruitless&amp;nbsp;thus forcing us to dig deeper and&amp;nbsp;seek harder for better sources of recovery. Trauma in our lives has the ability to turn our&amp;nbsp;hearts into&amp;nbsp;burnt out buildings where no life can exist.&amp;nbsp; In our human attempts to deal with the pain, we become self-focused and self-worshipping.&amp;nbsp; Terms such as &amp;quot;the human spirit&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;decency&amp;nbsp;of man&amp;quot; become familiar but false&amp;nbsp;gods that we turn to in hopes of change. This book takes the reader on a journey through one family&amp;#39;s exodus from tragedy and trauma into life.&amp;nbsp; It does not present the reader with the&amp;nbsp;perfect way to walk this&amp;nbsp;path nor does it&amp;nbsp;provide&amp;nbsp;a &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; recipe for success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The author has&amp;nbsp;willingly opened&amp;nbsp;up her heart to a sincere picture of what it was like for her and her family to live in the wilderness of fear, anger and neglect. She describes candidly&amp;nbsp;the effects of her own traumatized heart on her husband and children as well as the often difficult and imperfect&amp;nbsp;journey to real&amp;nbsp;healing love in Jesus Christ. Theirs&amp;nbsp;is not a story of religion but a story of truth that penetrates social,&amp;nbsp;economic and religious traditions with His penetrating light of love. It is a book that asks of the reader to be as honest and sincere with the hope that in allowing Christ to switch our own story line we&amp;nbsp;too might find what we&amp;nbsp;have been looking for. Those who love the prophetic gifts, spiritual maps and a few great pictures of a family who found real joy&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Jesus will find this book to be worthwhile. It will challenge and affirm, question and warn, but ultimately the story it tells will offer&amp;nbsp;hope in the wilderness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
