  <title>Knowing God Personally - Daouth Elias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about how much God loves human beings, even the ones who dont know him. He lives. It is all in the Bible, Old and New Testament. &lt;br /&gt;
God guides us through our entire life. How to overcome temptations? It is not easy. How to fix problems and overcome suffering? What does it mean to have any kind of relationship? What does it mean to have faith and religion? I also have dreams, miracles, and inspirationabout money and richness. &lt;br /&gt;
I have the preaching from the Ten Commandments, the way I understand it. &lt;br /&gt;
I have stories from personal experience. How to put our hope in God? In this book, I am explaining how much God is concerned, especially about the sufferer, the poor, the less fortunate, the homeless, the sick, the orphans, the unborn, also how much God wants to be our brothers keeper. &lt;br /&gt;
It also discusses the concept of loving your neighbor. This book will bring joy and happiness in many hearts. It will also bring mercy and peace into hearts of many. It is all from God. &lt;br /&gt;
For Christians, we know God personally because of Jesus, and he is our Savior." />
