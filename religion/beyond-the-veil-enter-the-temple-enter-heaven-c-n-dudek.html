  <title>Beyond the Veil: Enter the Temple, Enter Heaven - C. N. Dudek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we enter the temple, we enter heaven (Orthodox idea). When we go to church, we enter the kingdom of heaven. Heaven and earth are made one. It is the marriage of heaven and earth. At Christ&#39;s incarnation and at his death and resurrection, the cosmos was redeemed. The fall unraveling. We still must carry our cross and die daily, eventually physically. But there is great hope. When we follow Christ, we are transformed in this life and at the resurrection. Grace has become incarnate in Jesus Christ. Grace transforms us as we follow him. Beyond the Veil is a fictional tale of these theological realities. The story is a Dantean tale revealing that sin destroys, but the greatness and goodness of God&#39;s forgiveness, grace, and love mends all things. The medieval cosmic structure is the backbone of the story. Even C. S. Lewis shows up disguised as N. W. Clerk. The story&#39;s purpose is to instill wonder and delight in the reader. Wonder and delight of the cosmic redemption; the beauty, truth, and goodness of what God has created. The created order is in disarray but will be renewed as on the day of its creation. In addition to the story, the Appendix features several poems complementing the ideas of the tale." />
