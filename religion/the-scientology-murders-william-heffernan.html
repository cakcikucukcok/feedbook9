Clearwater, Florida, is the spiritual center of Scientology, which is run by a fanatical group of true believers who insist that members remain pure and true to their faith. One senior leader has a young man in his employ, a twisted soul who will stop at nothing to make sure the rules are followed. But Harry Doyle, his partner Vicky Stanopolis, and Clearwater Sergeant Max Abrams are in hot pursuit, forcing the killer to run for cover.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Scientologists have places to hide in every part of the globe, and Harry finds himself pursuing the killer to the far reaches of Alaska. In a shocking denouement where everyone&#39;s life hangs in the balance, Harry and Vicky come face-to-face with death in a form they never expected.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
