  <title>The Missing Ingredient - Ron McIntosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The missing piece you&amp;#39;re looking for is the missing ingredient.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Do you experience a gap between what you say you believe and what you actually experience?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you get frustrated when you&amp;#39;re determined to change, you have a short blast of energy, and then you slide back to the status quo?&lt;br /&gt;
Does success seem elusive or is there something you don&amp;#39;t know?&lt;br /&gt;
Does there seem to be a missing ingredient to success, prosperity, health, and abundant living?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is YES! And the road to real, lasting success starts in your heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Author Ron McIntosh discovered that The Missing Ingredient - The One Thing That Changes Everything isn&amp;#39;t a self-help strategy, but revelation for thriving from the inside out. Based on scripture, backed by neuroscience, and filled with experiences of those who have seen their lives changed by first changing the heart, The Missing Ingredient provides more than just a band-aid for life&amp;#39;s struggles, but a step-by-step process to transform what you say you believe into results you can see and experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Until your heart is wired for success, nothing you learn, nothing you know, and nothing you do will make a significant difference in your life. Once this missing ingredient is launched in your life, you will be able to tap into the inexhaustible resources of God&amp;#39;s Kingdom and experience the abundance you&amp;#39;ve dreamed of.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Join Ron McIntosh as he unfolds the Biblical principles and shows you how to close the gap between what you say you believe and what you actively see take place in your life. It&amp;#39;s time to activate the missing ingredient and start living the life you were born to live!&lt;/p&gt;" />
