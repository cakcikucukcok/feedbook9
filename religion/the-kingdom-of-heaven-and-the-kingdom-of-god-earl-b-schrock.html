  <title>The Kingdom of Heaven and the Kingdom of God - Earl B. Schrock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has prepared a kingdom (John 14:1-3) through Jesus Christ our Lord. The kingdom is free and available to all willing to be a child of God (Romans 8:14)
Inheriting the kingdom of God does not take place by desire. Nor can it be entered into by force. Its not a place that you can see or touch or feel or search for on a map. It is not a place, it is a relationship. It is the relationship mankind has with their Creator God when they surrender their all to Him allowing Him to be the King of every aspect of their lives. Thus they become the children of God.
Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devils work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because Gods seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not Gods child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister. (1 John 3: 7-10)
The kingdom or inheritance of God is entered into by the righteous. Its entered into by those who recognize they are lost sinners who have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 5:9; 12:11). Its inherited by those who surrender their will to God allowing Him to mold them into what He wants them to be, as the potter molds (Isaiah 64:8) the clay in making a useful vessel." />
