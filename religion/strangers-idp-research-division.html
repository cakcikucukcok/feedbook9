Kashf-ul-Kurbah fee wasfi Haali Ahlil Ghurbah&lt;br /&gt;
(Alleviating Grievances in Describing the Condition of the Strangers)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By:&lt;br /&gt;
Al-Haafiz Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee (736-795 AH)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It deals with the topic of the Strangers (or Al-Ghurabah), by listing many Ahadeeth reported about them, in which the Messenger of Allah (S) describes their attributes and explains their position. They are given this name because they will be considered strange during the Last Days, due to their adherence to the Sunnah and to the Way of the First Muslims. So just as those who accepted Islam at the hands of Muhammad (S) were considered strangers with their families and close ones, then indeed, those who adhere to the Qur&amp;rsquo;an and Sunnah in the Last Days, when innovation and misguidance become rampant and widespread, will also be considered strangers amongst their families and close ones, not to mention the disbelievers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
