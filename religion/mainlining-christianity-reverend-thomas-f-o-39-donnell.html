  <title>Mainlining Christianity - Reverend Thomas F O&#39;Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderate and liberal Christians, Unite!  Reclaim Jesus from the evangelical Christian right. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a faith tradition divided up into literally thousands of denominations based on such silly things as  organizational structure (how many bishops can you fit on the head of a needle?), or  theological differences such as  whether baptism is to be done by &quot;dunking&quot; or by &quot;&quot;sprinkling&quot; or whether or not the bread and the cup are actually transformed into the &quot;body and blood of Christ&quot; during the Lords Supper (the &quot;doctrine of transubstantiation&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that, even within a single denomination of this faith tradition,  those who profess to share the same faith have diametrically opposed views on the nature of God, the source of salvation, the nature of sin, the meaning of scripture, the relationship of Science and Religion, of Reason and Faith, of  Truth, Certainty, and Doubt.  Imagine further that they cannot even agree on the nature and/or message of the man upon whom their religion is founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, imagine that a vocal minority of these diametrically opposed views is dominating the public airwaves, while the &quot;silent majority&quot; remains hunkered down in the hallowed halls of their sanctuaries.  While the message of this vocal minority is embraced by a few in search of simple answers, imagine that the masses of un-churched, de-churched, under-churched, never-been-churched, fed-up-with-church are turned off  and are walking away in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no need to imagine any of this.  It is happening right here, right now in the United States of America.  The faith tradition is called Christianity.  The vocal minority that is dominating the bully pulpit of public opinion is the &quot;evangelical Christian right,&quot; and the &quot;silent majority&quot; are moderate and liberal Christians everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainlining Christianity is a call to Christianitys &quot;silent majority&quot;  to stand up and speak out and to join in a New Reformation.  Through the vehicle of &quot;95 Theses for the 21st Century,&quot; the book is divided into eight separate sections: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion, Christianity, and Worldviews&lt;br /&gt;
  Truth/Certainty/Doubt/Fear/Faith&lt;br /&gt;
  Physical Truths:  In Search of a Theory of Everything (T.O.E.)&lt;br /&gt;
  Spiritual, Scriptural, Literal, and Mythical Truths&lt;br /&gt;
  In Search of the Logos:  From Jesus the Man to Jesus the Christ&lt;br /&gt;
  In Search of the Logos:  Jesus and the Love Ethic&lt;br /&gt;
  Interfaith Interconnectedness and the Logos&lt;br /&gt;
  The Logos Intersects with the T.O.E.:  God Is LOVE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within each section is a series of messages designed to offer a practical/theological roadmap to just such a Reformation.  Moderate and Liberal Christians, Unite!  Reclaim Jesus from the evangelical Christian right. &lt;/p&gt;
