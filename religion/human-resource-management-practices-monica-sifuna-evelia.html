  <title>Human Resource Management Practices - Monica Sifuna-Evelia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this book is to link my human resource management experiences with my perception on what the Bible demonstrates about human resource management in general. My experiences are derived from industries such as health, media, security, education, manufacturing, and the banking industry. The Scripture quoted in this book is from the Holy Bible, New International Version (NIV). In the book, I have also made a number of references to the Kenyan Labor Laws of 2007 (Employment Act 2007, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and Labor Relations Act 2007). This book serves to enlighten employees about human resource management. Employees should learn that when a human resource practitioner does something, it is not out of malice but rather in line with the human resource policies. It is therefore the duty of the employees to adhere to the employee code of conduct and the human resource policies. 
Managers in other departments will also get enlightened to embrace and support the human resource department. These managers should learn that human resource policies apply to everyone in the organization regardless of their job titles. The human resource department is just as important as any other department in any organization. Human resource practitioners are therefore to be treated with respect and dignity as a part of the larger team driving the vision of the organization. Human resource practitioners will be encouraged to learn that in my perspective, the Bible is in support of human resource management practices. The Bible also gives human resource practitioners guidelines on how to run the human resource function. The human resource practitioners should therefore demonstrate integrity and professionalism as they work in this noble profession. Students joining universities will get motivation to pursue human resource management as a career from my story in this book. This is a unique, interesting, and well-rewarding career." />
