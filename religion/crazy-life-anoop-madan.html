  <title>Crazy Life - Anoop Madan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have never been so happy, even when i was alive. I can see my body lying lifeless besides me. Well its a great feeling to be no longer subject to any responsibility. And very soon i will see my creator - the god.
Look at these people - despondent and devastated. But i am happy today! I want to lose all the memories of what i had done to others in my life.
Why? My soul asked
Because i was born in the family of criminals and i was expected to follow their footsteps because lot of times this crazy life doesnt do justice to you.
After four days of my leaving this world, i could see only four people (my wife, my mother and my two kids) in the house and the madness of the sorrowful was over.
But in no time, my happiness turned in to despair. My five year old daughter ran in to her mother and said my prayers have been answered and there will be no killing of people as the god had just taken away the murderer from our lives. My wife cried and cried till her tears went dry. I could feel my eyes welling up with tears too. I was worried - how would i face the god and would i be able to take on the punishments for my sins." />
