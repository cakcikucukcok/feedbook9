  <title>Spiritual Truths and Experiences of Life After Death - Gert Niemand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of the information in this book came from Angels and Spiritual Masters, who are living in the greater World of Spirit. Therefore, I would like to thank all the Angels and Masters who came down to do their work for God in Love and with Love, and all their helpers, who helped me to fulfill an oath I made. During an out of the body experience, while standing at Mountain Zion in the Presence of God, I promised Him that I would tell all the people the truth about Him and His Spiritual Messengers, the Angels and other life in the Spirit World. All the Angels and Masters spoken to have nothing but Love for God, their fellows spirits, all of Mankind and the Animal Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life as we know it, continuo after death in a slightly different format, and regardless of what we say or believe every one of us knows deep in our inner being that we came from the world of spirit, and we knows deep inside ourselves that that world is real, and that we must one day return to it. Regardless of what we say or believe, we know within ourselves about the Presence of God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used most of these short stories as talks during church services, because Angels advised me what to write down, and to use what they have shown me in the world of spirit, as the talk. Therefore, most of the information in this book is from spiritual beings, they are the real authors of this book. I am just an instrument used by them as a voice box in the wilderness of Babel, to explain some of the wonderful stories we read of in the bible. In this way am I also complying with the vow I made to God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
