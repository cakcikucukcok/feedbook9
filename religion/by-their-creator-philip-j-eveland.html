  <title>By Their Creator - Philip J Eveland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why did the Plymouth colonists succeed and the Jamestown colonists fail in those important early years of settlement? How did the Framers of the Constitution deal with slavery? What was the principle force behind those feelings? What drove the debate against slavery in antebellum America? To what authority did the civil rights of the 1950s and 1960s leaders appeal for equality? What is the ugly truth pro-abortionists don&#39;t want us to know? Did man really evolve from ape-like creatures? Is the Earth millions of years old? Is the Bible reliable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to each of these questions establishes your moral identity, defining how you view yourself and others. How our nationits governors, legislators, presidents, and judgesanswers these questions, and how it uses these fundamental principles in establishing our laws, lays the foundation of our national moral conscience. It is that moral conscience that has consistently driven this nation forward in achieving justice and equality. Today, though, that moral conscience is being corrupted by a sinister ideology. A principle that is utterly antithetical to the one that has compelled our leaders to the highest moral standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book looks at that original principle and how it guided our leaders as they steered this nation safely through the rough waters of change. It looks, also, at how that great principle has been undermined, leaving us adrift in a turbulent sea of crisis. Mostly, though, it seeks to point us back to that great principle as the source of strength, courage, and honorcharacter traits sadly missing from many of todays leaders in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
