  <title>The Death of Ignorant Atheism - James Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are two forms of atheism, not just one, and in the death of ignorant atheism, James Duncan shows how important it is for both believers and non-believers to understand the difference between the two. 
The book addresses and debunks the common objections raised by modern atheists against the existence of the creator, and convincingly demonstrates how atheism is just empty fiction that exists within western society due to wide spread ignorance, and that most professing atheists would renounce the idea if they were truly aware of its self-contradictory and illogical nature. 
This book exposes modern atheism for what it really is." />
