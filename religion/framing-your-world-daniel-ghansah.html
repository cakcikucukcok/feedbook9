&lt;p&gt;Whether you were born in Disaster Lane or misfortune Avenue, you still possess enough divine energy and ability to transform your life. You must be willing to change your life for better and not just accept anything that life throws at you. Somewhere deep within you, there is a yearning for freedom and better life, and nothing should stop you from becoming the kind of person you dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning is empowering your belief with action. If you truly believe that you are entitled to the good of life, and I know you are, then you must show the worth of your desire with your willingness to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody is promised any better life until the Law of Beginning in put to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Author states what you constantly affirm, youll eventually become.&lt;/p&gt;
