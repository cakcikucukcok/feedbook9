  <title>Thorns and Thistles - Mark A. Escobar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the onslaught of reflections and other biblical materials available online, I have thought it best to welcome the challenge of putting into writing my homilies for each Sunday celebration. Hence, as a form of sharing, these written homilies are meant to help us appreciate our sense of discipleship. Like the seemingly endless footsteps of Christ in our lives, the gift of the Spirit leads us to be united in one faith that captures the sense of transformation as implied in gospel reflections. It is like a personal diary that attempts to lift the weight of Christs message within the richness of human experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discipleship demands new perspectives and priorities, these homilies articulate relationships in a variety of settings, images, and lifestyles of being in the world with others. Though they help us understand the presence of God in our lives, living with our own mystery and spirituality becomes like a dependable compass that is always there to guide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our road map as we walk by faith and not by sight alone. Jesus life, teaching, and ministry in a particular place, time, and culture have great significance to our journey, as far as our mission is concerned. He identifies himself with the people across cultures and he enters into solidarity with those in need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
