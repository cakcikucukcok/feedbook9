      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this six-session small group Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Andrew Marin leads you in peaceful and productive ways to engage the theological, political and social disconnects between the Christian community and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s culture often defines &amp;lsquo;bridge building&amp;rsquo; and reconciliation as a one-way street that leads to full theological, political and social agreement. Yet Christ demonstrated a different path of religious and cultural engagement to establish his kingdom here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of such countercultural principles, the Christian community needs a new view on the issues that divide conservative believers and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Marin uses practical applications he&amp;rsquo;s learned over the last decade of living and working in the LGBT neighborhood of Chicago (Boystown), as well as his international speaking and consulting ministry, to offer a variety of practical teaching, insights, and life-lessons on reaching the LGBT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than avoiding the topic of homosexuality,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Love Is an Orientation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;aims to equip the Christian community to bridge the gap between LGBT and religious communities.
