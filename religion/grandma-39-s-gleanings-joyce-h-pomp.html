  <title>Grandma&#39;s Gleanings - Joyce H. Pomp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grandmas Gleanings are the result of many years of journaling done by Joyce Pomp during her quiet time with the Lord. She is a pastors wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. The devotionals are saturated with Gods Word; they are also intended to bring you into a special relationship with our Father God, not a plastic, must-do religious activity. Grandma Joyce was encouraged to compile her writings into a yearly devotion book. Individuals who have had the opportunity to read Gleanings have told her how the true anecdotes/incidents have touched a specific need in their life as they read an entry for the day. Come to know God loves you. Come to know true joy in your life. Know that God still performs miracles today. Be assured: The joy of the Lord is your strength. You will be challenged. You will be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
