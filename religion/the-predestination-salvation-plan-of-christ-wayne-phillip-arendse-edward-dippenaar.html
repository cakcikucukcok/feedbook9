  <title>The Predestination Salvation Plan of Christ - Wayne Phillip Arendse, Edward Dippenaar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name is Wayne, and my life was one experience that youll never imagine. I grew up very poor,&lt;br /&gt;and my mom had to raise fi ve children, two girls and three boys, all by herself.&lt;br /&gt;But life was just diffi cult for her, and each day of my life growing up, seeing her struggle, was a&lt;br /&gt;nightmare. I would sit with my Bible or alone and ask myself if there is really a god out there,&lt;br /&gt;and how would this ever go awaystruggles, being poor, suffering, pain and sorrow one has to&lt;br /&gt;live through in ones life. I was baptized Anglican, but from primary school, to high school, and&lt;br /&gt;even when I got married, I was in a Roman Catholic church, where I was even an altar boy. Ive&lt;br /&gt;experienced being and going to different types of churches, but although the preaching is somewhat&lt;br /&gt;different, the beliefs are still the same. And these churches are Apostolic (new and old), Baptist,&lt;br /&gt;Roman Catholic, and Anglican. On the other hand, my wife belonged to the Original Apostolic&lt;br /&gt;Church, which is a combination of the New and Old Apostolic churches and Catholic churches. I&lt;br /&gt;then joined their church where I became a priest, taught Sunday school, Bible classes, and went to&lt;br /&gt;members home to testify and preach the gospel. Ive met a brother, who was an elder and my wifes&lt;br /&gt;cousin, and two other brethren. The elder, Edward, was the one who was gifted, including myself.&lt;br /&gt;We were always together, every occasion and event. Until one day we realized that every time we&lt;br /&gt;went out preaching, testifying, teaching Sunday school and Bible classes, things did not make sense.&lt;br /&gt;We came together each Saturday in our spare time and went over readings, through the Bible and&lt;br /&gt;catechism books, and found that the Bible became very easy to understand and how we all have&lt;br /&gt;been deceived, thinking that the Bible is holy. It became the book of judgment, and it shows how&lt;br /&gt;mankind is falling over their feet.&lt;br /&gt;Let me give an example so that we can all understand. If we read the Bible very carefully, we will&lt;br /&gt;see that the Bible, even up till today, is a weapon of defense. Men went into war and battle using&lt;br /&gt;the Bible or the name of their God. Today, when you enter a courtroom, the Bible is used to justify&lt;br /&gt;ones wrong or right acts. How can one say the Bible is holy, yet a man does crime with all his/her&lt;br /&gt;lies and must swear on the Bible? How cunning is this God that he has blinded us all. That is why&lt;br /&gt;now I can see why pain, suffering, and sorrow are there because of ones disobedience.&lt;br /&gt;It took seven years writing this book, which the Bible speaks of. The Book of Lifeand this is&lt;br /&gt;the Predestination Salvation Plan of Christ, which is part of the Book of Life, so that we can&lt;br /&gt;understand being in this body, but in full, we will understand when we leave this life, meaning&lt;br /&gt;God. Because with him, there is no religion, churches, belief, day or night, male or femaleno&lt;br /&gt;right or wrong, good and bad. In other words, nothing that is of God.&lt;br /&gt;This is my biography, and I hope that when you are reading this book, you&lt;br /&gt;will have a better and clearer understanding of what you believe. This book&lt;br /&gt;is not about judging anyone, but that we should learn to respect and let go of&lt;br /&gt;what we may think of others and what they believe in or not. That we accept&lt;br /&gt;one another no matter what our differences may be or seem like.&lt;br /&gt;You all have my blessing and have a blessed day.&lt;br /&gt;Wayne Phillip Arendse was born in South Africa, in Cape Town, in a town&lt;br /&gt;called Wetton, which is in the southern suburb. Hes still young, being fortyseven&lt;br /&gt;years of age. He is married, with a beautiful wife named Sharon and&lt;br /&gt;two kids, which are girls.
