  <title>Paul, God’S Evangelist and Minister - Raymond E. Isbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I am painfully aware of the fact that this presentation does not and cannot do justice to, perhaps, the greatest man to live during the Christian age. As improbable as it may have seemed, God took a young man named Saul and used him to spread the gospel to the world. Who could believe that God would take a narrow minded Pharisee, a conspiring murderer of Christians, a man with seemingly little oratorical ability, and a man without the experience of his own wife and family and use him in an unbelievable capacity to spread the gospel to the Gentile world. At the same time God used him to convince the Jews that Jesus Christ was the Savior they had anticipated for centuries and that their Law was the schoolmaster to bring the world to Christ for the redemption of all.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pauls evangelical work and personal letters to churches and individuals probably defined more activities and established more attitudes for worship and personal behavior for Christians than the activities any other person.&lt;/P&gt;" />
