  <title>Build - Stuart Lamont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;em&gt;Build&lt;/em&gt;, author Stuart Lamont guides the reader through the story of Nehemiah with a unique prophetic edge. The book likens the city of Jerusalem to the individual believer, and the city wall to the maturity of the believer. Stuart provides readers with a practical guide to take stock of their spiritual life, and then upgrade their spiritual life in a way they may not have thought possible&amp;mdash;by increasing their spiritual maturity and resilience. By exhorting the reader to get the basics of faith right&amp;mdash;no matter how boring this may seem&amp;mdash;Stuart equips the reader to be themselves, walk with God, and live a life punctuated by genuine transformation that is anything but...boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers of &lt;em&gt;Build&lt;/em&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understand why some of the methods they use in order to grow tend to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Become more objective about the suffering and challenges in their own life, and start building the momentum that comes from good choices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn how to maintain their momentum of personal growth long-term, by casting off the baggage of guilt, condemnation and confusion, and to be established immovable in Christ in the midst of trials and good times alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the book will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Connect with the reader through original illustrations from the author&amp;#39;s own life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Present four robust principles that the reader can start applying immediately, and thereby build momentum towards long-term change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Exalt Christ as the ultimate foundation for the reader&amp;#39;s life, and challenge the reader to put aside superficiality, perceived security and comfort, in order to take hold of the gifts that God freely offers to His children.&lt;/li&gt;
