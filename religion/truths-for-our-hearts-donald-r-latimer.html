      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is a surrendered walk
with Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Latimer writes a guide to help us look more honestly at ourselves. He helps us understand what a true, surrendered walk with Jesus is really all about and how it can be ours as it takes us to a secret and special place of fellowship that cant be found any other way. Don helps us understand the marvel of the miracle of having the Holy Spirit living within our hearts as he helps us understand what a wonder the guidance, training, and teaching are that this makes possible. He helps us understand how to be led by Jesus in how to respond to life in a way that will truly be pleasing to God. Dons Truths for Our Hearts will take us to a place where we can have Jesus as Lord and King, reigning from on high as he sets us free from the corruption of our flesh and the corruption of the world through the Spirit he has made to dwell in us. This is a necessary read for any believer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
