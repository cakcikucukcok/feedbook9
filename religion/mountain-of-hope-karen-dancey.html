  <title>Mountain of Hope - Karen Dancey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Karen collapsed into her dads arms upon learning her husband was gone. She was facing a mountain of heartache, with foothills of depression and devastating loss as a suddenly single mom. Now, this Midwestern pastors daughter could no longer avoid or hide her problems, fears, and dire circumstances but had to face them head-on. And in doing so, she was finally willing to acknowledge that people in church pews have problems too.  Karen shares how her story is just part of the bigger one God is writing. And so is yours. This true story will infuse you with faith as Karen shows you how Jesus can turn whatever mountain is ahead of you into a mountain of hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Danceys book reaches into deep places, tugs at the soul, and pulls out raw honesty and hard truth. Through the sharp turns of life, she never loses sight of the forgiveness, hope and love she has in Christ. Her storytelling is vivid and will hold you accountable for your own life in the best possible way. Having a longer lens through which to view her past, she writes with refreshing boldness and confident faith. Karen knows where shes been, where shes going, and to whom she belongs. From every angle, you will see glimpses into your own story and heart. It is clear God is using her tragic yet beautiful story to captivate us with the same living hope that rescued Karen in her darkest hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Kell Spehn is a New York Times Best Selling Author (The Color of Rain) and Co-Founder and President of New Day Foundation for Families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancey uses tender, raw honesty to trudge through her mountain of despair, all the while building a stairway to the mountain of hope that only our God can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Prisby, Teacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Karens story, you will see an inside glimpse into Gods sovereignty and love. God gave Karen an extreme soul makeover experience. He delivered her and turned sorrow and pain into joy and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
