  <title>Christ Will Build His Church: But What Is My Role? - H. Wallace Webster, Norman Geisler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the church continues to advance through the generations, The Great Commission is falling into great disarray. Discipleship has almost become obsolete. Leadership is dwindling, and most churches are trying to repair this lack of leadership in the wrong way.   This book is a call for us to return to the basics of what Jesus was commanding His disciples to do through The Great Commission. It does not just explain the importance of the commission, it maps out a detailed strategy for how to make this call work in the local church. It is important to realize that few churches are doing anything to train up their leaders. This book offers an attempt to be faithful to Jesus&#39;s Great Commission. What is most important about this three-year program is that it will develop the men of the church; this will provide a large group of men from which to draw your leadership.   Christ Will Build His Church gets back to the basics, takes the principles clearly outlined in Scripture, and argues that they are still valid today. The church is in great need. This book has the potential to draw us back to historic Christianity and to a discipleship that really works." />
