  <title>Commercial management Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How is the value delivered by Commercial management being measured? Who is the main stakeholder, with ultimate responsibility for driving Commercial management forward? How much are sponsors, customers, partners, stakeholders involved in Commercial management? In other words, what are the risks, if Commercial management does not deliver successfully? Will Commercial management deliverables need to be tested and, if so, by whom? Are there recognized Commercial management problems? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
&lt;p&gt;
This book is for managers, advisors, consultants, specialists, professionals and anyone interested in Commercial management assessment.
&lt;p&gt;
Featuring 609 new and updated case-based questions, organized into seven core areas of process design, this Self-Assessment will help you identify areas in which Commercial management improvements can be made.
&lt;p&gt;
In using the questions you will be better able to: 
&lt;p&gt;
- diagnose Commercial management projects, initiatives, organizations, businesses and processes using accepted diagnostic standards and practices 
&lt;p&gt;
- implement evidence-based best practice strategies aligned with overall goals 
&lt;p&gt;
- integrate recent advances in Commercial management and process design strategies into practice according to best practice guidelines
&lt;p&gt;
Using a Self-Assessment tool known as the Commercial management Scorecard, you will develop a clear picture of which Commercial management areas need attention.
&lt;p&gt;
Included with your purchase of the book is the Commercial management Self-Assessment downloadable resource, containing all 609 questions and Self-Assessment areas of this book. This helps with ease of (re-)use and enables you to import the questions in your preferred Management or Survey Tool. Access instructions can be found in the book.
&lt;p&gt;
You are free to use the Self-Assessment contents in your presentations and materials for customers without asking us - we are here to help. The Art of Service has helped hundreds of clients to improve execution and meet the needs of customers better by applying business process redesign. Typically, our work generates cost savings of 20 percent to 30 percent of the addressable cost base, but its real advantages are reduced cycle times and increased quality and customer satisfaction.
