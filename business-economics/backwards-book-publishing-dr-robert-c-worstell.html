  <title>Backwards Book Publishing - Dr. Robert C. Worstell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to Save Time, Earn More, Work Less by Publishing Backwards?!?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Note: See the bonuses in the back of this book, along with audio to each chapter.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The situation that most starting authors have (and I&amp;#39;ve seen the same thing you&amp;#39;ve run into) is: How the hell do you get from here to there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You hear and (are constantly told) about these outrageously successful authors. But only a very small few percent of people actually achieve that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to be successful you&amp;#39;ve got to study success. What I found by studying all these guys that are making six- and seven-figures as an author is that most of them have been starting out with books and ending up with courses. (Which makes the author more money: a $3.99 book or a $399.00 course?)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The beginning author, though, has to spend a lot of time and money they don&amp;#39;t have in order to do that. So most authors fail to make a livable income.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And as if we don&amp;#39;t have enough problems, how is it a solution to work backwards?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book as an Idea Container&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s go back to basics. Books are an idea container. They aren&amp;#39;t just an e-book, a paperback, and so on. The one set of content is pushed out through all these different versions: e-books, paperbacks, hardbacks, audio books, audio CDs, and also -- courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great part about that is courses sell the books and the books sell the courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Sensible Approach That Few If Any Use&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the secret: 1) record the course, 2) transcribe the audio, 3) edit it into your book. All types of books. You&amp;#39;ve got the video, audio, text, and graphics. So turn around and publish that course and also every version you can. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too simple, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also mostly unknown is that you can do this from your own home-office without having to buy expensive programs or services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can you save time, work less, and earn more? And still publish great books?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The secret how-to&amp;#39;s and steps are inside this book (along with bonuses and audio.)&lt;br /&gt;
