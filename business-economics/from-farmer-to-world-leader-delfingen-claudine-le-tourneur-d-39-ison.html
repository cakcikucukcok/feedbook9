  <title>From Farmer to World Leader - Delfingen - Claudine Le Tourneur d&#39;Ison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The story of Delfingen is not only the story of Bernard Streit who remarkably developed the company but it also closely relates to the astonishing path of the Streit family, men and women of sturdy character, strong personality and outstanding courage.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br type=&quot;_moz&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Bernard Streit is an unconventional corporate leader. Here is a man of peasant origins, whose school achievements are modest and who is ill at ease when it comes to writing. To top it off, he was plagued by an extremely shy nature when he was a young man. Thanks to his unlimited willpower and remarkable foresight, he managed to hoist Delfingen, step by step, among the very first world leaders in its field.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br type=&quot;_moz&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The man is fascinating and he tells his story in an extremely simple and straightforward manner. It’s much more than a success story, more than simply explaining how a rural kid developed a global company. It’s the story of how this self-made man, through forty years of hardships and victories, developed a unique vision of life and a most original understanding of the world.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br type=&quot;_moz&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The way he made his company grow, his spectacular success and his testimony give rise to unlimited optimism. His favorite aphorisms: &lt;em&gt;“The worst is never sure to come.”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“What is impossible today may become possible tomorrow.”&lt;/em&gt; sum up pretty well the extraordinary life of Delfingen’s charismatic boss. The whole book contains surprising and positive messages that Bernard Streit wanted to pass on to his coworkers, customers, partners and to all those who will read this little gem.&lt;/span&gt;
