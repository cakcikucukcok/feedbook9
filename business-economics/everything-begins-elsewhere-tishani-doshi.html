  <title>Everything Begins Elsewhere - Tishani Doshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this, her first poetry collection since the award-winning Countries of the Body, Tishani Doshi returns to the body as a central theme, but extends beyond the corporeal to challenge the more metaphysical borders of space and time. These new poems are powerful meditations born on the joineries of life and death, union and separation, memory and dream, where lovers speak to each other across the centuries, and daughters wander into their mothers&#39; childhoods. As much about loss as they are about reclamation, Doshi&#39;s poems guide us through an &#39;underworld of longing and deliverance&#39;, making the exhilarating claim that through the act of vanishing, we may be shaped into existence again. &#39;These poems move in different directions, as true poetry should. We hear in them joy and sadness, praise and lament, love and disenchantment &quot;??simultaneously. Tishani Doshi speaks courageously about herself, about her choices, about the growing shadows. It&#39;s a beautiful book&#39; &quot;??Adam Zagajewski.In this, her first poetry collection since the award-winning Countries of the Body, Tishani Doshi returns to the body as a central theme, but extends beyond the corporeal to challenge the more metaphysical borders of space and time.
