  <title>Coping with Chemotherapy - Dr Terry Priestman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;More than one in four people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during their lives, and most of them will need chemotherapy. This makes chemotherapy one of the most widely used forms of treatment today. For many, &amp;amp;#145;chemotherapy&amp;amp;#8217; is a frightening, almost taboo word &amp;amp;#150; but today&amp;amp;#8217;s sophisticated drugs are resulting in ever improving cure rates, as well as better quality of life during the treatment itself. Coping with Chemotherapy explains what the treatment is, how the drugs work, and different ways in which they can be given. It also explains how to tackle side effects such as sickness, tiredness and hair loss. This new edition also looks at the growth in importance of hormonal treatments, and of targeted therapies, drugs which attack specific abnormalities on cancer cells. The advice on money matters has also been updated and expanded.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
