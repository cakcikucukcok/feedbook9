      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t usually know what we are born to do. We certainly also don&amp;rsquo;t know what kinds of obstacles we will face, or what forms they will take. When we understand how the world has been connected through history&amp;mdash;through the movement of people, goods, languages, music, movies, and many other things&amp;mdash;we see our world more clearly as a shared planet and a home for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is very little in life more important than acting quickly and with great decisiveness. Many people all over the world have dreams&amp;mdash;big dreams or small dreams. To get there, we have to take risks. People who have studied business or been in the business world, like me, know that in business, one often discusses risk versus reward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be Unstoppable is a golden nugget of wisdom, through the stories into which my life&amp;rsquo;s energy has flowed and emerged greater each time, that will bring you gold, in real money and in what is important in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
