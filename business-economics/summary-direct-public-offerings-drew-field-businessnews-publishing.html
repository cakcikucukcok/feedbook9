  <title>Summary: Direct Public-Offerings - Drew Field - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This ebook offers a summary of the book “DIRECT PUBLIC OFFERINGS: The New Method For Taking Your Company Public by Drew FIELD”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Direct Public Offerings (DPO) have now become a viable way for companies to sell stock directly to the public -- without the expense and overheads  required  by the traditional  underwritten  IPO process.  Further,  the DPO offers  significant  advantages  and opportunities to investors -- by significantly broadening the number of companies in which they can invest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The largest pool of capital in the world is in American households. Selling corporate shares into that market has traditionally been left to the securities industry. Today, however, the securities industry earns far greater revenues by acting as merchant bankers than they do in retailing stock to the public. In addition, most investors believe the best IPO investment opportunities are rarely available to the man on the street, and are instead allocated to preferred customers of the investment bankers. A DPO reverses that trend, and places every person on a level playing field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message is simple. The money is there for any business, on the best possible terms -- at zero interest, free of restrictions on how the business should be run and without any need to ever be repaid. The old, traditional ways of getting that funding are no longer working efficiently. For entrepreneurs today, there is a new way to get new stockholders -- through a Direct Public Offering. Don’t start or expand a business without it being an integral part of your plans." />
