  <title>Automotive Embedded Systems Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How will you measure your Automotive Embedded Systems effectiveness? Is Automotive Embedded Systems dependent on the successful delivery of a current project? Is the impact that Automotive Embedded Systems has shown? Are there Automotive Embedded Systems Models? How are the Automotive Embedded Systems&#39;s objectives aligned to the organization’s overall business strategy? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
&lt;p&gt;
This book is for managers, advisors, consultants, specialists, professionals and anyone interested in Automotive Embedded Systems assessment.
