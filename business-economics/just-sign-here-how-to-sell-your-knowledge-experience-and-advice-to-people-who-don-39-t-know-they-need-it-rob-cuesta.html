  <title>Just Sign Here: How to Sell Your Knowledge, Experience and Advice to People Who Don&#39;t Know They Need It - Rob Cuesta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Selling professional services is not like selling products. Products can be seen. They can be felt. They are tangible. You can give them to a potential buyer and let them get used to owning them. Heck, they can be owned!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Professional services just aren&amp;rsquo;t like that. You can&amp;rsquo;t give someone a bag of advice. You can&amp;rsquo;t let someone take your expertise for a spin round the block. And there are rarely economies of scale if someone wants to do ten consulting projects instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether you are a consultant, a coach, an accountant, a lawyer or any other service professional, you know how hard it can be to sell the intangible and the invisible. Five-time international best-selling author Rob Cuesta draws on 26 years&amp;rsquo; experience as a trusted professional adviser working with some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest organisations and some of the smallest, to unlock the secrets of closing complex advisory deals without coming across as salesy, slimy or slippery. Get tried and tested tools you can put into action today, and watch your revenue grow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
