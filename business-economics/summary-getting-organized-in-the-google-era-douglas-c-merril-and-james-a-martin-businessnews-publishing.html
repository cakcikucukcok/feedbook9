  <title>Summary: Getting Organized in the Google Era - Douglas C. Merril and James A. Martin - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “GETTING ORGANIZED IN THE GOOGLE ERA: How to Get Stuff Out of Your Head, Find It When You Need It, and Get It Done Right” by Douglas C. Merrill and James A. Martin. Today’s world is fast-paced and information-saturated. To keep your head above water, you need an organizational system which will handle the endless stream of information which gets thrown at you, integrate the tasks you need to get done and allow you to focus on the challenges which will confront you every day. In other words, you need an organizational system which takes full advantage of available technology rather than one developed for bygone eras when paper To-Do lists were all that were required.Forget about looking for a one-size-fits-all organizational system – it doesn’t exist. Instead, you have to develop your own system which will meet all the unique twists and demands you face in your life and career. In Getting Organized in the Google Era, the authors present 21 Principles of Organization to help you develop a system which works for you. Stop wasting time: read Getting Organized in the Google Era and do more of what you decide is important to do every day. You will feel more successful and ultimately less stressed." />
