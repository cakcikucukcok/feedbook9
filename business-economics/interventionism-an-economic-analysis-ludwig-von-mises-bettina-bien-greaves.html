  <title>Interventionism: An Economic Analysis - Ludwig Von Mises, Bettina Bien Greaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; Interventionism&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; provides Mises&#39;s analysis of the problems of government interference in business from the Austrian School perspective. Written in 1940, before the United States was officially involved in World War II, this book offers a rare insight into the war economies of Hitler&#39;s Germany and Mussolini&#39;s Italy. Mises criticizes the pre-World War II democratic governments for favoring socialism and interventionism over capitalist methods of production. Mises contends that government&#39;s economic role should be limited because of the negative political and social consequences of the economic policy of interventionism.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ludwig von Mises&lt;/STRONG&gt; (1881&amp;#8211;1973)&amp;#160;was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the &lt;I&gt;Anschluss&lt;/I&gt;, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bettina Bien Greaves&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;#160;is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education.

She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
