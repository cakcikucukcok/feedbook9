  <title>Beyond the Talking Points: Taking a Deeper Look At America&#39;s Issues - Mark Goshdigian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even before the election of Barack Obama, Americans were beginning to notice that the country had changed direction. Five years into his presidency, neither he nor the legislators in Congress are willing to do the work necessary to solve our problems. Critical thinking may not be sexy, but it&#39;s what will enable us to overcome our most formidable challenges. Author Mark Goshdigian, an everyday American concerned about the nation&#39;s future, bucks the trend in a series of essays that pose tough questions: Can the federal government and Federal Reserve continue to turbo-charge the economy by spending so much money? How has globalization affected the United States? What can we do to fight an entitlement culture? Can we still learn from our failures and dare to be great? Whether you&#39;re a government worker, politician, voter, or student, you owe it to yourself to examine the economy, the nation&#39;s social issues, and the political process so we can move beyond the talking points." />
