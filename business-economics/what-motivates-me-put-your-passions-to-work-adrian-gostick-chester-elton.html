  <title>What Motivates Me: Put Your Passions to Work - Adrian Gostick, Chester Elton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;What Motivates Me&lt;/I&gt; will help readers align the work they do every day, for the rest of their lives, with what truly motivates them. It also includes a code to the Motivators Assessment. This is not a personality test, but a scientifically valid assessment that digs straight to the core of what motivates you at work. The book also features a set of thought-provoking exercises to help readers sculpt their jobs with 60 powerful strategies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After analyzing the results of 850,000 interviews, the authors sought to discover why so many people are not as engaged and energized as they could be at work. They found those who are happiest and most successful are engaged in work that aligns with what motivates them. What Motivates Me offers an extensively tested method to help readers identify their core motivators and figure out the disconnects between their passions and their current work, and guides all those searching for joy and engagement by asking the important questions - &amp;#147;What motivates me?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#147;What can I do about it?&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
