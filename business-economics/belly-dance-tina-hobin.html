  <title>Belly Dance - Tina Hobin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tina Hobin – acknowledged expert and practitioner of belly dance, with many years experience of teaching and dancing throughout the world – introduces us to the history of this ancient and mystical dance in an accessible style, both enjoyable and easy to read. Tracing the evolution of belly dance from prehistoric fertility rites, the cult of the shaman and temple dances of Ancient Egypt, she explores how the music and motion of the belly dance featured in the rise and fall of entire empires. Looking also at modern belly dance and its growth across the Western world, Tina Hobin combines the history of dance with an explanation of the health benefits of dance, and a step-by-step guide to modern dance movements. Hobin also asks that we dismiss the commercial exploitation of dance, which is in danger of hiding the art behind this oldest of art forms." />
