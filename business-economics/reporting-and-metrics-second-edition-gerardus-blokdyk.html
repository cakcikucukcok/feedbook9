  <title>Reporting and Metrics Second Edition - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with Reporting and Metrics changes?  Is a fully trained team formed, supported, and committed to work on the Reporting and Metrics improvements?  How do you use Reporting and Metrics data and information to support organizational decision making and innovation?  How do you make it meaningful in connecting Reporting and Metrics with what users do day-to-day?  How do you identify specific Reporting and Metrics investment opportunities and emerging trends?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Reporting and Metrics investments work better.
