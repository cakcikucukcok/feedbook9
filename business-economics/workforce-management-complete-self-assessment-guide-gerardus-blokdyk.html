  <title>Workforce Management Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is Workforce Management currently on schedule according to the plan? If substitutes have been appointed, have they been briefed on the Workforce Management goals and received regular communications as to the progress to date? Do you monitor the effectiveness of your Workforce Management activities? What prevents me from making the changes I know will make me a more effective Workforce Management leader? How will the Workforce Management team and the organization measure complete success of Workforce Management? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
&lt;p&gt;
This book is for managers, advisors, consultants, specialists, professionals and anyone interested in Workforce Management assessment.
&lt;p&gt;
Featuring 611 new and updated case-based questions, organized into seven core areas of process design, this Self-Assessment will help you identify areas in which Workforce Management improvements can be made.
&lt;p&gt;
In using the questions you will be better able to: 
&lt;p&gt;
- diagnose Workforce Management projects, initiatives, organizations, businesses and processes using accepted diagnostic standards and practices 
&lt;p&gt;
- implement evidence-based best practice strategies aligned with overall goals 
&lt;p&gt;
- integrate recent advances in Workforce Management and process design strategies into practice according to best practice guidelines
&lt;p&gt;
Using a Self-Assessment tool known as the Workforce Management Scorecard, you will develop a clear picture of which Workforce Management areas need attention.
&lt;p&gt;
Included with your purchase of the book is the Workforce Management Self-Assessment downloadable resource, containing all 611 questions and Self-Assessment areas of this book. This helps with ease of (re-)use and enables you to import the questions in your preferred Management or Survey Tool. Access instructions can be found in the book.
&lt;p&gt;
You are free to use the Self-Assessment contents in your presentations and materials for customers without asking us - we are here to help. This Self-Assessment has been approved by The Art of Service as part of a lifelong learning and Self-Assessment program and as a component of maintenance of certification. Optional other Self-Assessments are available. For more information, visit http://theartofservice.com" />
