  <title>A New Monetary System and Why You Need It - Stefan B Sigfried</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Was 2008 just a foreshock and something more terrrible is awaiting us? What will happen to your job, savings, pension, and the future of your children? Are any investments safe? In this book you will find out why fiat money is a dishonest type of money and why economic theories fail us. How the US government, banks and smart people make money out of thin air. Money bubbles, the flaw in the gold standard. Deeper underlying problems with economic theories will be revealed. Understanding will give you an important edge to protect yourself, your family from the consequences of the coming crisis. But, to get real protection we need a new monetary system that is safe and beneficial for everyone, and for this we need to get politicians into power who think and act differently; today an engineering attitude is essential, simply because people with an engineering attitude know how to make things work. Stakes are high. Time is running out. This book is easy to read. Can you afford not to read it?" />
