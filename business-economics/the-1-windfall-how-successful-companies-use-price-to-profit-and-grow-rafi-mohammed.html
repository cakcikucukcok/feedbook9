  <title>The 1% Windfall: How Successful Companies Use Price to Profit and Grow - Rafi Mohammed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading pricing expert Rafi Mohammed shows businesses how to reap a financial windfall and foster growth using the underutilized and often overlooked strategy of setting prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 1% Windfall&lt;/em&gt; reveals how modest incremental changes to an everyday business practice&amp;#8212;pricing&amp;#8212;can yield significant rewards. Illustrating the power of pricing, a study of the Global 1200 found that if companies raised prices by just 1%, their average operating profits would increase by 11%. Using a 1% increase in price, some companies would see even more growth in percentage of profit: Sears, 155%; McKesson, 100%; Tyson, 81%; Land O&#39;Lakes, 58%; and Whirlpool, 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that better pricing is more than simply raising prices. Instead, the key is to offer customers a variety of pricing options. This strategy is win-win: profits to companies and choices for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do executives and managers set the right price? Underpinned by sound empirical research and real-life anecdotes, &lt;em&gt;The 1% Windfall&lt;/em&gt; addresses this fundamental question. This book offers guidelines that any company&amp;#8212;whether a multinational conglomerate, a small business, or even a nonprofit&amp;#8212;can follow to create a comprehensive pricing strategy for any product or service. In addition, these versatile techniques and tools provide solutions to avert a slump in a recession, offset the impact of inflation, or battle a new competitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a mind-opening, clear blueprint for com-panies to price for profit and growth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
