      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What are the Key enablers to make this Condition-based maintenance move?  Is there a Condition-based maintenance management charter, including business case, problem and goal statements, scope, milestones, roles and responsibilities, communication plan?  Does the Condition-based maintenance task fit the client&#39;s priorities?  How can the value of Condition-based maintenance be defined?  ask yourself: are the records needed as inputs to the Condition-based maintenance process available?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
