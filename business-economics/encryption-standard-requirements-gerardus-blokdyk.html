  <title>Encryption Standard Requirements - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Applying encryption software to data in the cloud, are these controls permitted in a particular country/jurisdiction?  How do we manage Encryption Knowledge Management (KM)?  in other words, can we track that any Encryption project is implemented as planned, and is it working?  What may be the consequences for the performance of an organization if all stakeholders are not consulted regarding Encryption?  How do we Lead with Encryption in Mind?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Encryption investments work better.
