How do we manage Collective business system Knowledge Management (KM)?  How do we Improve Collective business system service perception, and satisfaction?

Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
