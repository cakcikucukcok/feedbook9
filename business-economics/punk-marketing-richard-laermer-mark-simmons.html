  <title>Punk Marketing - Richard Laermer, Mark Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The marketing revolution is here, so get on the right side of the barricade and become a part of it! Let&#39;s thank Mr. and Mrs. Consumer and their little Consumerlings who have seized power from the corporations and are now firmly in control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Punk Marketing&lt;/em&gt;, Laermer and Simmons take an irreverent, penetrating look at the seismic change in the relationship between the people who sell stuff&amp;#8212;products, services, entertainment&amp;#8212;and those who purchase it. They demonstrate that to survive in business, a revolutionary approach is needed&amp;#8212;one they have branded &quot;Punk Marketing&quot;&amp;#8212;and it&#39;s one we all need to understand, for the traditional divisions among commerce, content, and consumers are continuing to blur ever more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never dull, sometimes controversial, but always a helluva lot of fun, &lt;em&gt;Punk Marketing&lt;/em&gt; presents a manifesto for any businessperson needing to engage consumers&amp;#8212;or any consumer seeking to understand and employ their newfound power. And here&#39;s the good news: It&#39;s based on principles that have existed forever. In an age of digital video recorders, &quot;branded&quot; entertainment, cell-phone TV, multiplayer online games, and never-ending social networking, a coherent approach to marketing has never been more vital. With &lt;em&gt;Punk Marketing&lt;/em&gt;, there&#39;s a built-in plan to equip you with tools to make all this change work out just fine, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punk Marketing&lt;/em&gt; is the first shot&amp;#8212;soon to be heard &#39;round the world&amp;#8212;of a long-awaited and breathless uprising that businesses want, deserve, and desperately need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
