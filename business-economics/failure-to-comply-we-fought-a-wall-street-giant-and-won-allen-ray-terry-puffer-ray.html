  <title>Failure to Comply: We Fought a Wall Street Giant and Won - Allen Ray, Terry Puffer Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Failure to Comply: We Fought a Wallstreet Giant and Won is a true story of one couples struggle to fight back against a corporate giant worth billions of dollars. Dont you know how big we are? We will crush you in a court of law if you decide to fight your foreclosure!
The story begins with a semi-truck accident along the interstate that could have taken the life of Mrs. Rays husband of 35 years. Instead, through sheer determination, the loss of a lifetime of savings, hours of rehabilitation and research regarding the securitization of their mortgage, this couple stands triumphant at the end of a year long court battle.
While the book was being published, the giant returns to sue again. By court order Failure to Comply: We Fought a Wallstreet Giant and Won was immediately put on hold until the second court case was litigated. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ray prevailed in the second trial but were ordered never to show the name of the Wallstreet Lender that sued them twice.
The agreement between the litigants is SEALED under order by the court and the name of the giant is forever redacted. What is the TRUTH that Wallstreet lenders dont want the public to know?" />
