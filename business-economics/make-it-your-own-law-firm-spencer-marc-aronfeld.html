  <title>Make It Your Own Law Firm - Spencer Marc Aronfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &quot;Make It Your Own Law Firm: The Ultimate Law Student&#39;s Guide to Owning, Managing, and Marketing Your Own Successful Law Firm&quot; Spencer Aronfeld writes a personal and revealing account on how to start your own law firm.  
Whether you are in law school, recently graduated or a practicing attorney thinking of establishing your own law firm, this book provides a step-by-step road map.  Aronfeld started his own law practice upon graduation from law school.  He provides practical advice that will enable anyone with a deep passion to practice law to become the lawyer that they always wanted to be.
Here is what lawyers are saying: &quot;Whether you have ever considered starting your own firm or simply want to improve your practice at your existing firm (whether big or small), I urge you to purchase the book Make It Your Own Law Firm by Spencer Aronfeld, a trial attorney in Miami, Florida. I recommend you buy it not so much for the helpful advice he gives on how to develop your practice (and theres plenty of that) but more for the writing. What Spencer does, which few non-fiction writers can do, is to move you emotionally. He tells stories and puts you in the middle of them with him and makes you feel what he did. It is a unique and valuable gift for a lawyer, because ultimately we are story-tellers and we are tasked not only to affect the jurors minds but also to touch their hearts. Spencers writing style demonstrates he is the consummate story-teller and his diction and cadence and style are worth emulating. So, buy the book. Yes, it has great practice tips. But buy it because you will see what great writing is about. Clear, direct, moving and effective. Keep writing Spencer.&quot;  Frank Ramos, Esquire" />
