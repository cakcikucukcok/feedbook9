  <title>Summary: Career Warfare - David d&#39;Alessandro - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “CAREER WARFARE: 10 Rules For Building A Successful Personal Brand And Fighting To Keep It” by David D’Alessandro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David D’Alessandro is chairman and chief executive officer of John Hancock Financial Services, an insurance and financial services provider. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The true tests of your business career are never quite what you expect them to be. For example, many people assume companies are logical and rational. They think that if they work hard, get good performance reviews and do the right things, their careers will flourish. Then, they watch in amazement as promotions are doled out around them in a cryptic fashion based on bizarre, even whimsical rationale or snap judgments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what actually separates those who excel from those who simply plod on? According to D’Alessandro, the most important thing you can do to further your career is to build your own personal brand or reputation. In Career Warfare, the author presents ten rules for building and keeping a great personal brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with useful advice, Career Warfare is an inspiring and easy-to-read book for anyone aspiring to have a highly successful career.&lt;br&gt;" />
