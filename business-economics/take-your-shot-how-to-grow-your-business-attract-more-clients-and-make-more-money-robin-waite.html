  <title>Take Your Shot: How to Grow Your Business, Attract More Clients, and Make More Money - Robin Waite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE YOUR SHOT&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story about Russ Hibbert. Russ is a hard worker, dedicated to his wife and children, and building a career as a golf professional. But one day he wakes up and realises his business is going nowhere. A chance meeting with a business coach, David, leads to a dramatic change and an opportunity, for Russ, to design the business that he always wanted, and start on his own entrepreneurial journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is ultimately an answer to the question: &amp;ldquo;How can I make more money, attract more clients, and grow my business?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE YOUR SHOT&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;will teach you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- To change your perceptions of your own business so that you get out of your own way&lt;br /&gt; - To set a brave goal, develop a strong desire to overcome obstacles, and the activities required to achieve your goal&lt;br /&gt; - How to build desirable products, price those products confidently and demonstrate value to prospects&lt;br /&gt; - How to get the business and life you&amp;rsquo;ve always dreamed of, increased prosperity, and to have fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russ ends up entering the world of entrepreneurship&amp;nbsp;all thanks to the clear and concise direction from his Business Coach, David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well&amp;hellip; Robin has smashed it out the park (or off the green, if you prefer!) with his second book. It&amp;#39;s a relatable story, which I&amp;#39;m sure will resonate with everyone. What I love is that Robin has picked out the key learnings about pricing and productisation, and weaved them into the story so that everyone can benefit. Fantastic.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Carl Reader - Author of The Startup Coach&amp;nbsp;and Serial Entrepreneur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a book. Robin is a business coach extraordinaire and a fantastic human being, but he has outdone himself with this piece of genius. Unlike most business help books, this reads like a novel you can&amp;rsquo;t put down. This isn&amp;rsquo;t because it&amp;rsquo;s crazy and out of this world, but instead because he describes the thoughts and actions of every business owner at their start or point of frustration in their business. The special thing about Robin and this book is that he looks at the business owner, not the business. He brings you on a journey where you can&amp;rsquo;t help but have lightbulb moments. The only thing better for your business than this book is working with the man himself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Michael Serwa - Coach for the Elite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take Your Shot is a great, easy-to-read book that contains some serious messages for anyone working hard at building a business. I came across a phrase many years ago which can apply to many self-employed individuals &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s easy to become a busy fool&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading this book will stop you falling into that trap as the serious messages are about the importance of belief, aiming high, being brave creating systems and surrounding yourself with the right people. A very uplifting read as the reader follows the journey of the main character as he learns to work smarter and enjoy life again.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sandra Webber, High-Performance Coach and Author of Own It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Robin&amp;#39;s book is so much better than the usual &amp;#39;how to&amp;#39; publication. By telling a story based on a real business owner, he takes us on a journey that will resonate with readers no matter what industry they are in, no matter how small or large their enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those business owners is always &amp;lsquo;busy&amp;rsquo;, this book will help you to investigate what you are busy doing and whether you are effectively working towards a goal that truly motivates you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a step by step approach that is easy to understand and implement, if you do what the book suggests, you will achieve the outstanding success you deserve.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;David Tovey, Author of Principled Selling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
