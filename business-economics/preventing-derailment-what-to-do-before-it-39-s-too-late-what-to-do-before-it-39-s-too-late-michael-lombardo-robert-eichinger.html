      <meta name="description" content="Many new managers rely too heavily on the technical or problem-solving strengths that have propelled them upward and fail to understand that new skills are required to continue to be effective as managers. The problem arises for both individual and organizational reasons and results in many managers failing to make the transitions required to deal with the increasing complexity they face. When this happens, many managers whose careers have been full of promise stumble and derail. This title will assist managers in the pursuit to continue to be successful leaders in their organizations." />
