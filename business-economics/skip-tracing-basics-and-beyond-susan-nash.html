  <title>Skip Tracing Basics and Beyond - Susan Nash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Featured on Taking Care of Business on www.wcwp.org 88.1 FM and www.TCBRadio.com out of Brookville, Long Island, NY with Richard A Solomon&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of what to do, or where to turn, or would simply like to learn new or more advanced methods of skip tracing, you will acquire the knowledge of what actions to take and a responsible direction for your efforts with innovative lessons and priceless tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart R. Blatt Attorney at Law and DBA Debt Buyers Association Past President&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the private Investigator business and this is an amazingly valuable resource for seasoned investigators, any person considering a career as a private investigator and those who seek advice on how to do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmie Mesis  Publisher PI Magazine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every chapter of this book mentions skip tracing secrets that have been put to a practical test by thousands of skip tracers nationwide. Discover the tricks of the trade, from an expert who knows things and is not afraid to share them. Get a sneak peak at skip tracings finer points and discover the skip tracers magic tricks. Pick up secrets for your bag of tricks. Learn to skip trace like a pro by using techniques like: suggestion and autosuggestion; tradecraft and trickcraft; misdirection &amp; logical thinking; roping and deductive reasoning; the invisible web and operation card shop. For every action theres an equal and opposite reaction and in a world of duality, wheres theres pleasure, theres pain. Creativity is not always organized, so youll learn to work smart and not hard. Your only limits are your acting abilities. Keep might and right on your side because innovation is driving success. If you are ready to put these secrets to use, you will recognize them. I wish I could tell you how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much of the benefit you will receive when you make the discovery on your own. Bank on it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
