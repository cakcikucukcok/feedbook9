Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
