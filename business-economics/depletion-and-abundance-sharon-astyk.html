  <title>Depletion and Abundance - Sharon Astyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why are so few peak oil authors women? There&#39;s been much debate about this, and no one has yet arrived at a definitive answer. But whatever the reason, Sharon Astyk has established herself as a true rarity within the peak oil community by virtue of being a woman who has chosen to write about peak oil. The perspective she offers is thus both uncommon and vital.&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Depletion and Abundance&lt;/I&gt;, she shows how rewarding life on her New Home Front could be, immeasureably improving our health, nutrition, sense of community and overall well-being. Chief among its benefits would be all the extra time that we&#39;d have. She points out that people in medieval times worked far fewer hours than Americans do today, and that most people in modern-day peasant societies also work less hard than we do.&lt;BR&gt;This, along with Astyk&#39;s unique perspective as a woman, a mother and a peak oil activist, makes Depleiton and Abundance well worth a read. The ring of authenticity to her writing will hook you - while its relaxed style, ineffable humor, personal anecdotes and comforting touch will soothe your melancholy peaknik soul like a warm hand on the shoulder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Reviewed by Frank Kaminski, &lt;I&gt;Energy Bulletin&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sharon&#39;s introduction is pricelss in its succinct, dead-on analysis of collapse, and is reason enough to buy and send this book to everyone you know who is partially or completely clueless about where we&#39;re headed. &quot;&lt;I&gt;When I realized that everything was going to change, I was at first afraid. Because I thought, if my government or public policy or other choices weren&#39;t going to fix everything, what could I possibly do? What hope was there, if I had to take care of myself, if my community had to take care of itself?&lt;BR&gt;But when I began looking for solutions that could be applied on the level of ordinary human lives, that involved changes in perspectives and pulling together, the reclamation of abandoned ideas and the restoration of strong communitites, I began to feel hopeful, even excited. Because I realized that when large institutions cease to be powerful, sometimes that means that people start being powerful again.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Depletion and Abundance &lt;/I&gt;is not a feel-good book, but it is intensely human, compassionate, supportive, pracitcal, alarming, enlivening, and astonishingly accurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Reviewed by Carolyn Baker, &lt;I&gt;Carolynbaker.net&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;Climate change, peak oil, and economic instability aren&amp;#8217;t just future social problems&amp;#151;they jeopardize our homes and families right now.Our once-abundant food supply is being threatened by toxic chemical agriculture, rising food prices and crop shortages brought on by climate change. Funding for education and health care is strained to the limit, and safe and affordable housing is disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Depletion and Abundance&lt;/I&gt; explains how we are living beyond our means with or without a peak oil/climate change crisis and that, either way, we must learn to place our families and local communities at the center of our thinking once again. The author presents strategies to create stronger homes, better health and a richer family life and to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;*live comfortably with an uncertain energy supply&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    *prepare children for a hotter, lower energy, less secure world&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    *survive and thrive in an economy in crisis, and&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    *maintain a kitchen garden to supply basic food needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, readers will discover that depletion can lead to abundance, and the anxiety of these uncertain times can be turned into a gift of hope and action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unusual family perspective on the topic, this book will appeal to all those interested in securing a future for their children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
