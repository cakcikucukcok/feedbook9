  <title>Talent Without Borders - Robert E. Ployhart, Jeff A. Weekley, Julian Dalzell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Talent is one of the most important strategic resources in the modern economy: it is the resource that creates economic growth through exceptional innovation, service, and performance. But talent is scarce, and finding the right talent, in the right place, and at the right time, is challenging. Talent is not distributed evenly within and across borders. Hence, generating a competitive advantage in the modern economy is dependent on identifying, attracting, hiring, and retaining the talent needed to implement a firm&#39;s strategy.&lt;em&gt; Talent Without Borders &lt;/em&gt;shows how to generate a competitive advantage through the effective use of global recruitment and staffing.
Based on a century of science, &lt;em&gt;Talent Without Borders &lt;/em&gt;offers a practical approach to help managers think about acquiring talent globally. With explicit consideration of real-world issues that influence the implementation of global staffing solutions, the book shows managers how to use analytics and data to enable evidence-based decisions. Emphasizing national culture, strategy, and competitive advantage, it considers the entire talent life cycle, from attraction through retention. Together, the three authors represent a unique blend of expertise in HR executive leadership and consulting with deep technical expertise in the science of recruitment, selection, and assessment. Their collective experience yields numerous practical insights woven throughout the book. Ultimately, they skillfully link staffing to organizational strategy, financial performance, and competitive advantage." />
