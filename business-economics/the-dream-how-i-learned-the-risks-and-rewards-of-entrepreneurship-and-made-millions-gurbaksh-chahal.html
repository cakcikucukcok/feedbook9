  <title>The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions - Gurbaksh Chahal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of America&#39;s most successful young internet entrepreneurs tells his unique and inspiring story, and reveals the risks and rewards behind the sky&#39;s-the-limit possibilities of internet entrepreneurship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gurbaksh Chahal started the Internet advertising company ClickAgents from his bedroom at the age of 16, having emigrated to the United States with his Sikh family from the small town of Tarn Taran, India. He dropped out of high school to pursue the venture full-time, and two years later sold ClickAgents for $40 million, making him one of the youngest self-made millionaires in history and allowing him and his entire family to realize their dreams. Chahal went on to become the youngest executive of a multi-billion dollar NASDAQ-listed company, and then sold his second company, BlueLithium, to Yahoo! for $300 million, turning many of his employees into multi-millionaires as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Dream&lt;/i&gt;, Chahal&#39;s refreshing advice for entrepreneurs encourages them to embrace risk and to carve out new niches in the marketplace. He emphasizes the value of good business timing: how to execute an idea and get it to the marketplace, how to create and maintain solid business relationships, how to stay grounded, and -- most importantly -- how to teach yourself that failure is not an option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chahal&#39;s story not only shows how a 16-year-old immigrant overcame discrimination and adversity to fulfill his highest ambitions, but also provides aspiring entrepreneurs with valuable hands-on advice on how to achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
