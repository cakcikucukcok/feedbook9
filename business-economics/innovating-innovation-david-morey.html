  <title>Innovating Innovation - David Morey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Innovation Tools for Successful Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation needs innovation:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Innovation is broken. Business leadership and management struggle to find ways to crack through their own corporate politics or bureaucratic silos, to move from defense to offense, to nurture real breakthrough, to drive visionary creativity in ways that add new value to everything they do. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Innovating Innovation&lt;/em&gt;, David Morey, one of America’s leading strategic consultants, will teach, coach, and guide you across eleven concrete and pragmatic steps that unlock and drive day-to-day innovation in your business and help you gain a long-term competitive advantage in your marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make change and innovation happen:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Innovating Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;synergizes what is best in classic innovation theories with an insurgent strategic model inspired by one of Morey’s first corporate clients, Apple founder Steve Jobs. It shows how to lead innovation that creates the products of visionary genius without the necessity for actual genius. It provides practical tools and guidance on building and leading the teams, working conditions, organizational structures, and cultures of market-made and market-making innovation. It illustrates a roadmap to the disruptive periphery, the organizational margins at which real innovation actually takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation can be taught:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Innovating Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a framework to counter failure. It directs you, the reader, to the consumer, the very person who will actually tell you how to innovate the benefits to create a future you can own. This book invites you to “think different,” to become a change leader, to go the “wrong” way to get to the right places. And it shows you how to apply the pragmatic lessons of Agile software development to absolutely everything and to accelerate your leadership career and your company’s success by stepping up from mere evolution to punctuated equilibrium, evolution as breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your business needs unique innovation:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You and your business need innovation as never before and unlike anyone else’s. This is lesson number one. And in the space of eleven chapters,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Innovating Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers lesson number two: You don’t need to be a genius to deliver the performances, products, and services of innovation at genius levels in the most opportunity-rich and threat-intensive business environment in history. Your management and leadership skills will improve immensely, taking your business to a level of innovation success beyond what it has ever achieved before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovating Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a step-by-step handbook for teaching, and at times even tricking, your organization, your culture, and your company into real-world change. After reading this new battlefield manual for innovation, you will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn the Disruptive Periphery Concept and how it can give you the tools to help your business&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover a practical marketing-centric focus applied to innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reap the benefits of lessons developed from thirty years of real-world global consulting and training experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\" />
