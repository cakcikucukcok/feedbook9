  <title>The Human Capital: Challenges and Perspectives - Cosmin Stoica, Cristina Balaceanu, Dan Boaja, Daniela Penu...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The nowadays society is confronted with some of the most pronounced disparities in the economic system, with direct repercussions on the labor market, borne by both employees and employers. The main deficiencies of the labor market are caused by the low growth rate of the demand for goods, with consequences in terms of employment, the effect of decreasing the purchasing power of the population, the lack of correlation between the growth rates of labor productivity and the price of labor, and also to an insufficient training of a practical nature of the workforce. Labor market is therefore a manifestation of the need to work for both the production act, from the perspective of the firms sector, and the consumer act, from the perspective of the households sector, each of the two sectors having different determinations for the same objective: gaining profit from valuing the work. Therefore, work is analyzed in the terms of profitability: cost for the producer, income for the worker, benefit for the society, in the conditions in which from valuing the work production factor and the human capital it can be created the object of the economic goods market. In the current economic and social-political development context, on the labor market there is an intensification of a series of manifestations that have as substance educational and cultural heterogeneity, the institutional dissolution or the dissolution of authorities in what regards the establishment of some normative elements that would favor work and entrepreneurship, by means of economic strings, mainly fiscal ones, the lack of complementarity between educational policies and occupational ones. Importance of labor market equilibrium resulting from the decisive role of human resources in the economic and social development." />
