Indeed, the general structures of the comprehension of the reality, no matter the direct reality from physiological basis of subjects of the representative representative imagery from alternative reality which was composed through the rationality through subjective will of subjects after cognitive revolution, wasn&amp;#39;t matter as much as before while the specific and detailed problems of the reality will be the focus of the subjects that could be solved through the scientific methods with validity of precondition of continuum of time through subjects and meaning of the subjects in the associated network of society in large scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.
