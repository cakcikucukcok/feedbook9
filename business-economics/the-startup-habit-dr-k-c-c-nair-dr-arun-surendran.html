  <title>The Startup Habit - Dr. K C C Nair, Dr. Arun Surendran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between 2012 and 2014, the authors of this book met regularly on weekends to discuss the entrepreneurship scene in India and Kerala in particular. We swapped stories of the budding entrepreneurs, their struggles and successes. We worried about the disappointments, cheered the excitements and patiently waited for the turnarounds of the young men and women who had taken the plunge into the exhilarating environment of entrepreneurship. 
Over the course of several months, from what we saw firsthand, from what we heard and from what we read, it dawned on us that there is a pattern among the success stories. We began a more structured analysis to see if our hunch was correct. This book is the product of that investigation. We share our realization that more than luck or genius, it is the presence of certain habits that consistently lead to sustained success in the turbulent world of business startup.
If you are already on the path to business success, the content will help you fine tune some of the habits. You can look at your own progress from a new perspective. 
If you have been thinking for a while to get going, let this book be the guide that assists you to acquire the right habits for Startup success. 
If you are student looking for a safe, salaried job upon graduating, we urge you to read through in order to understand how the business world operates and is fundamentally guided by the entrepreneurial spirit.
If you have never thought of being an entrepreneur but have been merely curious, we hope to inspire you to give it a shot, again and again" />
