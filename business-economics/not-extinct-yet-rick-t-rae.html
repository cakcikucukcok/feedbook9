  <title>Not Extinct Yet - Rick T. Rae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Former newspaper executive publishes new book Not Extinct Yet.
In his memoir of 44 years in publishing, Rick Rae talks about the ups and downs of the newspaper business from his unique vantage point. In a career spanning almost twenty locations in the United States and Canada, Rick has worked for, or managed over fifty newspapers. In this book he shares some of his experiences, such as butting heads with unions, dealing with employees who embezzle, contacts with celebrities, law suits, advertising sales techniques, competitive market situations and many other details about this fascinating industry.
He has worn several hats during his years in the business.... from ad sales, editor, production manager, circulation manager, publisher, vice president and president of publishing companies ranging in size from small local weeklies to suburban dailies in the 100,000-200,000 circulation range. He talks about buying his own company at age 68 and how he is growing his company as he enters his 73rd year.
