  <title>Extreme You - Sarah Robb O&#39;Hagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a child, Sarah Robb O&amp;#8217;Hagan dreamed she could be a champion. Her early efforts failed to reveal a natural superstar, but she refused to settle for average. Through dramatic successes and epic fails, she studied how extraordinary people in sports, entertainment and business set and achieve extremely personal goals. Sarah became an executive at Virgin Atlantic and Nike, and despite being fired twice in her twenties, she went on to become the global president of Gatorade and of Equinox&amp;#8212;as well as a wife, mother, and endurance athlete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every challenging situation, personal or professional, individuals face the pressure to play it safe and conform to the accepted norms. But doing so comes with heavy costs: passions stifled, talents ignored, and opportunities squelched. The bolder choice is to embrace what Sarah calls Extreme You: to confidently bring all that is distinctive and relevant about yourself to everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiring, surprising, and practical, &lt;em&gt;Extreme You&lt;/em&gt; is her training program for becoming the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
