  <title>Character In Everything â?? Forever - Richard G. Lazar PhD, CarÃ´n Caswell Lazar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Character is the knowledge, which opens a treasure chest to the kingdom of life and love and life afterward. Our insights and writing is likened to Napoleon Hill&amp;#39;s great book Think And Grow Rich. Our secret key to human character is that it is not psychological, per se. It is a blend of morals and ethics. Therefore think of it simply as thinking and doing good, right, helpful and better. Values shape character. Character isn&amp;#39;t everything yet it affects everything in almost every phase of life. It is mentioned after selecting the wrong people for important positions, assuming high character without the evidence in prior history. We see it in sports, government, management and leadership, education and teaching, families and in our opinions about all of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human Love precedes character building. Character flaws are correctable. Honor can and does exist in civilian, day to day life although we hear of honor more in military activities then civilian life. There is an American Character. It has a lot to do with executing on The Common Good. The ways to develop High Character Practices (Winner Ways) versus the ways to overcome Low Character Practices (Loser Ways) are provided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excellent Managers and Leaders, and Decent-Human-Beings, practice Character&amp;ndash;Coaching to achieve high character practices to achieve the common good of an enterprise that includes profit for all stakeholders along with sustainability and growth." />
