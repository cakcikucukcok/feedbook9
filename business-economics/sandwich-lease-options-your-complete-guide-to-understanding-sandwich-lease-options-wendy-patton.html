  <title>Sandwich Lease Options: Your Complete Guide to Understanding Sandwich Lease Options - Wendy Patton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A guide to investing in real estate when lending is tight - without needing a mortgage, good credit, or a down payment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Audience: The investor looking to invest in real estate using lease options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lease Options are becoming quite the buzz word lately. Years ago it was harder for me to get Realtors to even consider a Lease Option for their clients. Today, markets all across the country have changed. Lease Options are currently a viable industry trend and needed for many sellers to sell their homes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is a Lease Option?&lt;br&gt;A Lease Option is a way to purchase real estate, usually with very little or no money down, sometimes even with money back in the investor&amp;#39;s pocket. Sound too good to be true? Well, it isn&amp;#39;t. Can an investor end up with money in their pocket and not have to put 10-20% down to purchase real estate? Yes. This technique is used commonly today by the most successful real estate investors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lease option strategy gives an investor the right to lease a home and also the right to purchase the home during or before the end of the lease period. An option is a contract that gives an optionee the right to exercise a privilege &amp;ndash; and in the case of real estate investing, it gives the optionee (investor) the right to purchase property during a contracted period of time. It is a technique that involves gaining &amp;acirc;??control&amp;#39; of a property, without the total burdens of ownership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALL money made in real estate is made by controlling property. Owning property is the most obvious way to control it, but control is possible without ownership &amp;ndash; and control is what makes the money. It was a dying John D. Rockefeller who told all of us his secret to achieving great wealth, &amp;quot;Control everything, own nothing.&amp;quot; All of the most successful real estate developers today utilize options, in one form or another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sandwich lease option involves the investor selling the home to a tenant buyer through &amp;quot;sandwiching&amp;quot; themselves in the middle of the deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When doing any lease option deal, it is one of my mottos that everyone must win or don&amp;#39;t do the deal. There are 3 people involved in a Sandwich Lease Option: the seller, you (the investor) and the tenant/buyer. It must be a win/win/win, otherwise walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sandwich lease options are extremely profitable for real estate investors." />
