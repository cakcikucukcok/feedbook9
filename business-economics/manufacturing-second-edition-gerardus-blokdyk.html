  <title>Manufacturing Second Edition - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is the scope of Manufacturing defined?  What prevents me from making the changes I know will make me a more effective Manufacturing leader?  Does the Supplier own fully the design and the manufacturing of the entire PLC line of product?  What would be the goal or target for a Manufacturing&#39;s improvement team?  How would one define Manufacturing leadership?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Manufacturing investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
This Manufacturing All-Inclusive Self-Assessment enables You to be that person.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All the tools you need to an in-depth Manufacturing Self-Assessment. Featuring 709 new and updated case-based questions, organized into seven core areas of process design, this Self-Assessment will help you identify areas in which Manufacturing improvements can be made.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In using the questions you will be better able to: 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- diagnose Manufacturing projects, initiatives, organizations, businesses and processes using accepted diagnostic standards and practices 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- implement evidence-based best practice strategies aligned with overall goals 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- integrate recent advances in Manufacturing and process design strategies into practice according to best practice guidelines
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using a Self-Assessment tool known as the Manufacturing Scorecard, you will develop a clear picture of which Manufacturing areas need attention.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
