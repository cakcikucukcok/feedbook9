  <title>cross-compiler Second Edition - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do mission and objectives affect the cross-compiler processes of our organization?  What is cross-compiler&#39;s impact on utilizing the best solution(s)?  Is there any existing cross-compiler governance structure?  Who needs to know about cross-compiler ?  What may be the consequences for the performance of an organization if all stakeholders are not consulted regarding cross-compiler?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make cross-compiler investments work better.
