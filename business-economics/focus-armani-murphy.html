  <title>Focus - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Do you skip around from one thing to the next, without completing or finishing anything?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re living in an unprecedented era where we have an abundance of information on our fingertips. However, are we truly making full use of technology or have we been used by technology? Research has shown that interruptions happen every 12 minutes in the workplace and every 3 minutes in university settings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How could this be when we could be so much wiser now when information is all around us? You and I both know the answer. Everything right now is so easily accessible that we want things quick, we want things right now. Sadly, focus doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen on demand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to focus for at least 1 hour without distraction, you&amp;rsquo;re in trouble. If the slightest things around you annoys you and distracts you while working, we have a big issue. As a culture, we&amp;rsquo;ve progressed in so many areas and at the same time, we&amp;rsquo;ve moved backwards in so many ways. Like passion, Focus, unused diminishes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are you ready to take back control of what&amp;rsquo;s rightfully yours? Your Focus? Scroll up now and click on the &amp;ldquo;BUY NOW&amp;rdquo; button to reclaim your focus today. See you inside this little book!" />
