  <title>The King of Madison Avenue - Kenneth Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the former CEO of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the first biography of advertising maverick David Ogilvy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous for his colorful personality and formidable intellect, David Ogilvy left an indelible mark on the advertising world, transforming it into a dynamic industry full of passionate, creative individuals. This first-ever biography traces Ogilvy&#39;s remarkable life, from his short-lived college education and undercover work during World War II to his many successful years in New York advertising. Ogilvy&#39;s fascinating life and career make for an intriguing study from both a biographical and a business standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The King of Madison Avenue&lt;/i&gt; is based on a wealth of material from decades of working alongside the advertising giant, including a large collection of photos, memos, recordings, notes, and extensive archives of Ogilvy&#39;s personal papers. The book describes the creation of some of history&#39;s most famous advertising campaigns, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &quot;The man in the Hathaway shirt&quot; with his aristocratic eye patch&lt;br&gt;* &quot;The man from Schweppes is here&quot; with Commander Whitehead, the elegant bearded Brit, introducing tonic water (and &quot;Schweppervesence&quot;) to the U.S.&lt;br&gt;* Perhaps the most famous automobile headline of all time--&quot;At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.&quot;&lt;br&gt;* &quot;Pablo Casals is coming home--to Puerto Rico.&quot; Ogilvy said this campaign, which helped change the image of a country, was his proudest achievement.&lt;br&gt;* And his greatest (if less recognized) sales success--&quot;DOVE creams your skin while you wash.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roman also carries Ogilvy&#39;s message into the present day, showing the contemporary relevance of the bottom-line focus for which his business ventures are remembered, and how this approach is still key for professionals in the modern advertising world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
