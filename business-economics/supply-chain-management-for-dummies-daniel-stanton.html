  <title>Supply Chain Management For Dummies - Daniel Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Everyone can impact the supply chain&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supply Chain Management For Dummies&lt;/i&gt; helps you connect the dots between things like purchasing, logistics, and operations to see how the big picture is affected by seemingly isolated inefficiencies. Your business is a system, made of many moving parts that must synchronize to most efficiently meet the needs of your customers—and your shareholders. Interruptions in one area ripple throughout the entire operation, disrupting the careful coordination that makes businesses successful; that&#39;s where supply chain management (SCM) comes in. SCM means different things to different people, and many different models exist to meet the needs of different industries. This book focuses on the broadly-applicable Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return, and Enable, to describe the basic techniques and key concepts that keep businesses running smoothly. &lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re in sales, HR, or product development, the decisions you make every day can impact the supply chain. This book shows you how to factor broader impact into your decision making process based on your place in the system. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Improve processes by determining your metrics&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose the right software and implement appropriate automation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Evaluate and mitigate risks at all steps in the supply chain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Help your business function as a system to more effectively meet customer needs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We tend to think of the supply chain as suppliers, logistics, and warehousing—but it&#39;s so much more than that. Every single person in your organization, from the mailroom to the C-suite, can work to enhance or hinder the flow. &lt;i&gt;Supply Chain Management For Dummies&lt;/i&gt; shows you what you need to know to make sure &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; impact leads to positive outcomes." />
