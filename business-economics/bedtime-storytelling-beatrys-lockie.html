  <title>Bedtime Storytelling - Beatrys Lockie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is so special about telling stories? Unlike when reading from a book, you have your arms free to make gestures, use props -- or give a tickle. And above all, you have eye contact, so you can observe and respond to your child&#39;s reactions. This collection of classic tales includes advice on how to tell stories to children: how to establish a routine and create a mood; how to involve children and personalise your stories. The stories are suitable for children aged from three to seven years old. Many are old favourites that are regularly told in kindergartens, nurseries and schools &quot;??tales about magical creatures and exotic animals as well as stories from everyday life. Many people say they cannot tell stories, but Beatrys Lockie is a firm believer that everyone can; it just takes a little practice. Stories include: The Little Jug, The Mitten (Any Room for Me?), The Tomten, The Star Child, How the Zebra Got its Stripes, King Grizzly Beard and Hans in Luck.What is so special about telling stories?
