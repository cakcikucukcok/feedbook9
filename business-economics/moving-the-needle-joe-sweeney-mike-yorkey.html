  <title>Moving the Needle - Joe Sweeney, Mike Yorkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A detailed system that will help you achieve your professional and personal goals&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moving the Needle&lt;/i&gt; provides both the &quot;kick in the pants&quot; and the game plan many of us need to break out of the rut and get moving to achieve our goals. CEOs, vice presidents, professionals, military personnel, and even college students frequently express frustration at the entrenched status quo, in which initiating progress feels like moving mountains. This book lights a path toward continual improvement, helping readers first find a direction, then make the key transitions that jumpstart forward progress. This highly practical guide outlines a change process that can be applied to professional or personal goals, giving readers a concrete plan for making big things happen. Rather than blindly shooting for the moon, readers will formulate a solid, systematic, actionable plan that can only result in progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s tenuous business climate, employers and employees alike can be glued to the ground, unsure of the path they should take, or whether they have the freedom to move forward. &lt;i&gt;Moving the Needle&lt;/i&gt; helps readers clarify their current position, identify their optimum position, and formulate a workable strategy for getting from here to there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find what &quot;moving forward&quot; means for your career and life&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shake off the doldrums of routine and establish a culture of innovation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Improve performance on a consistent basis, at every level&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Break the inertia and get moving in the right direction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stagnation is diametrically opposed to progress. Moving forward requires a vision, a plan, and the impetus to get things done. Those who sense that big things can happen need to get clear, get free, and start &lt;i&gt;Moving the Needle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
